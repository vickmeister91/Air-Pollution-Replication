The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Smt. Monu Bansal and Smt. Usha Rani against the State of Rajasthan and various other government officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court ordered the matter to be listed for further hearing on March 20, 2015.

In this case, the court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court also requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case before the next hearing. The State failed to comply with the directions, and the court warned of imposing a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if they did not submit the plans and action report. The District Collector was directed to be present with all relevant records on the next hearing date.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The State Government was directed to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The State Government was also directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments.

The court order discusses compliance reports and the lack of action taken by the government in regards to removing encroachments and collecting compensation. The court gives the state counsel another opportunity to respond to the compliance report and orders the District Collector to appear before the tribunal. The court also suggests that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT. The order also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances in which this principle may be ignored.

The court order discusses a petitioner seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it.

The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner(s) sympathetically.
