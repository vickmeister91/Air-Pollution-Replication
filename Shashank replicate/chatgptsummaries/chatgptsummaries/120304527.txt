The court's decision to acquit Ganesh Kumar was based on the prosecution's failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The charge against him was that he had installed a bore well pipe without permission, which was a violation of the Protection of Environment Act. However, the court found that there were contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses, which weakened the prosecution's case.

The court's decision to extend Ganesh Kumar's bail and surety bonds for six months was made under section 15 of the Protection of Environment Act.

The court order stated that the file would be kept in the Record Room, which is a standard practice in Indian courts.

Overall, the court order in the case of State versus Ganesh Kumar was a mixed result for both the prosecution and the accused.
