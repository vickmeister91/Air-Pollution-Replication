The court has granted bail to Sukhchain @ Chaeina in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant was accused of being in illegal possession of 10-12 kg of beef of Sambhar (Wild Life Animal). The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it will become ineffective.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading in wild animals and their products. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Sukhchain @ Chaeina was accused of being in illegal possession of 10-12 kg of beef of Sambhar, a wild animal protected under the Act. The possession of such meat is a violation of the Act and can lead to imprisonment and fines.

The court, however, granted bail to Sukhchain @ Chaeina without commenting on the merits of the case. Bail is a legal process that allows a person accused of a crime to be released from custody until the trial. The court may grant bail if it is satisfied that the accused will not abscond or tamper with evidence and will cooperate with the investigation.

In this case, the court ordered Sukhchain @ Chaeina to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused to appear in court as and when required. A solvent surety is a person who guarantees to pay the bail amount if the accused fails to appear in court.

The court also made it clear that the order will remain effective until the end of the trial. This means that Sukhchain @ Chaeina will be released from custody but will have to appear in court as and when required until the trial is over. However, if he fails to appear in court, the bail order will become ineffective, and he may be arrested again.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sukhchain @ Chaeina without commenting on the merits of the case is significant. It indicates that the court did not find the evidence against him to be strong enough to justify his continued detention. However, it does not mean that he is innocent of the charges against him. The trial will determine his guilt or innocence.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sukhchain @ Chaeina in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant was accused of being in illegal possession of 10-12 kg of beef of Sambhar (Wild Life Animal). The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it will become ineffective. The decision to grant bail without commenting on the merits of the case indicates that the court did not find the evidence against him to be strong enough to justify his continued detention. However, it does not mean that he is innocent of the charges against him. The trial will determine his guilt or innocence.
