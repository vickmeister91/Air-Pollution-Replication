The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard a case (OA No. 114/2013) regarding the closure of brick kiln activities in Bundi District and areas adjacent to Bundi city in the State of Rajasthan due to environmental pollution and damage to citizens' health. The applicants alleged that the Respondents allowed brick kiln owners to continue their activities in violation of various state and environmental laws. The Respondents denied the allegations and stated that only licensed brick kilns were allowed to operate. The case was transferred from the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan to the Central Zone Bench, Bhopal of National Green Tribunal.

The NGT issued a court order stating that brick kiln owners in the Bundi district of Rajasthan must obtain consent from the State Pollution Control Board before establishing and operating their units, in compliance with the Air Act and EP Act. The order also suggests guidelines for regulating and monitoring brick kiln activities, including registration with the District Industries Centre, fixing minimum distances from human habitation and institutions, and disposal of waste water and ash in a scientific manner. The order further states that no brick kilns are allowed to be established within one kilometer of Abadi area, and any violations will result in penalties and removal of the kilns.

The court order includes several directives related to environmental regulations for brick kilns and mining projects. These include developing a green belt to prevent air pollution, obtaining permission before tapping ground water, complying with national air quality standards, and not obstructing natural water flow. The order also requires a survey of all brick kilns to ensure compliance with regulations and the closure of any non-compliant units. Additionally, the order mandates that mining projects for brick earth must obtain environmental clearance and follow specific guidelines related to excavation depth, drainage patterns, and worker safety. Violations of these regulations may result in cancellation of environmental clearance.

The court order prohibits borrowing of earth or excavation of brick earth or ordinary earth within 1 km of the boundary of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. If the area of borrowing/excavation is likely to result in a cluster situation, mining operations will only be allowed if environmental clearance has been obtained. Brick kilns are not allowed in valuable agricultural lands, and the guidelines on utilization of fly ash shall be followed for production of fly ash bricks. The court cannot go into the details of whether any rules are violated by the district administration/revenue department while granting establishment of brick kilns, but the RSPCB and the District Collector, Bundi shall file a compliance report on all the brick kilns inspected and brick kilns sanctioned.

The NGT's court order also mandates that the Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary, Revenue Department, Government of Rajasthan shall issue necessary directions to all the District Collectors in the state for ensuring compliance. The matter will be listed in court on July 31, 2014.
