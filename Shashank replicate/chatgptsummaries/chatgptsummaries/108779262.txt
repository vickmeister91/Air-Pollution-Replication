The court has granted anticipatory bail to three individuals, Pradeep Mahto, Nardu Mahto, and Dhupan Mahto, who were accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The allegations against them were that they shared the flesh of a deer that had died after being chased by stray dogs. The court directed the petitioners to surrender in the Court of learned C.J.M., Palamu within four weeks from the date of the order. In the event of their arrest or surrendering, they would be enlarged on bail on depositing Rs.2,000/- each as cash security and on furnishing bail bond of Rs.25,000/- each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Palamu in connection with Complain Case No.2906 of 2017 subject to the conditions as laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including birds and reptiles, without a permit. The act also prohibits the trade in wildlife and their products. Violations of the act can result in fines and imprisonment.

In this case, the accused were alleged to have violated the act by consuming the flesh of a deer that had died after being chased by stray dogs. The court granted anticipatory bail to the accused, which means that they would not be arrested if they surrendered to the court within four weeks. The court also imposed certain conditions for their release on bail, including the deposit of cash security and the furnishing of a bail bond with sureties.

The conditions for bail are laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This section allows a person to seek anticipatory bail if they have reason to believe that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offense. The court may grant anticipatory bail if it is satisfied that the person is not likely to flee or tamper with evidence and that their release on bail would not be detrimental to the interests of justice.

In this case, the court was satisfied that the accused were not likely to flee or tamper with evidence and that their release on bail would not be detrimental to the interests of justice. The court, therefore, granted anticipatory bail to the accused subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the accused has been criticized by some as being lenient. They argue that the accused should have been punished for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. However, others have defended the court's decision, stating that the accused have not been proven guilty and that they have a right to seek bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to three individuals accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has imposed certain conditions for their release on bail, including the deposit of cash security and the furnishing of a bail bond with sureties. The court's decision has been criticized by some as being lenient, but others have defended it as being in line with the principles of justice.
