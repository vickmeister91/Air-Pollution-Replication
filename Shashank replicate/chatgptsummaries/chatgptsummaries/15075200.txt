In the first court order, Sushila Jain had filed a revision against an order issued by a magistrate to issue non-bailable warrants against her and two others in a case filed by the Wildlife Department for possession of banned ivory articles. However, the court dismissed the revision, stating that the impugned order was interlocutory in nature and did not affect any right or liability of the parties. The court cited legal precedents to support its decision and noted that the accused's counsel had not pressed the revision.

The case involved the possession of banned ivory articles, which is a violation of wildlife laws. The Wildlife Department had filed a case against Sushila Jain and two others, and the magistrate had issued non-bailable warrants against them. Sushila Jain had filed a revision against this order, but the court dismissed it, stating that the order was interlocutory in nature and did not affect any right or liability of the parties.

The court cited legal precedents to support its decision. It noted that the accused's counsel had not pressed the revision, which indicated that they did not consider it to be a significant issue. The court also observed that the impugned order was merely a procedural order and did not affect the substantive rights of the parties. Therefore, the court dismissed the revision.

In the second court order, the Additional Sessions Judge-02 in Delhi announced and dictated an order in open court on March 20, 2012. The order stated that a file should be sent to RR and a copy of the order should be sent to the Trial Court.

The order did not provide any details about the case or the parties involved. It simply directed that a file should be sent to RR and a copy of the order should be sent to the Trial Court. It is unclear what the purpose of this order was or what impact it had on the case.

In conclusion, the two court orders are quite different in nature. The first order pertains to a revision filed by Sushila Jain against an order issued by a magistrate to issue non-bailable warrants against her and two others in a case filed by the Wildlife Department for possession of banned ivory articles. The court dismissed the revision, stating that the impugned order was interlocutory in nature and did not affect any right or liability of the parties. The second order is a brief directive that a file should be sent to RR and a copy of the order should be sent to the Trial Court.
