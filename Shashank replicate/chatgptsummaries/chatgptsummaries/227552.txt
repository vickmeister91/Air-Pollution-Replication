The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has been ordered by the court to serve a formal order to M/s Teg Forgings & Stamping within a week. The order pertains to a case where the Board had initiated action against the petitioner's forging units without passing a formal order. The petitioner claimed that this was depriving them of the opportunity to challenge the validity of the order. The Board, on the other hand, claimed that a formal order had been passed and would be served to the petitioner within two days if not already served.

The court, after hearing both sides, ordered the Board to serve the formal order within a week. The court also stayed the sealing of the noise-polluting activities in the unit for three weeks. The petition was disposed of with no costs.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that formal orders are passed before taking any action against a party. This allows the party to challenge the validity of the order and defend their position. In this case, the petitioner was able to argue that they were being deprived of this opportunity and the court agreed.

The court's decision to stay the sealing of the noise-polluting activities in the unit for three weeks also shows the importance of balancing the interests of both parties. While the Board may have had valid concerns about the noise pollution caused by the forging units, the court recognized that the petitioner's business would be adversely affected if the sealing was done immediately. By staying the sealing for three weeks, the court has given the petitioner time to comply with any orders that may be passed by the Board while also allowing them to continue their business in the meantime.

Overall, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of due process and balancing the interests of both parties. It also serves as a reminder to regulatory bodies to ensure that formal orders are passed before taking any action against a party.
