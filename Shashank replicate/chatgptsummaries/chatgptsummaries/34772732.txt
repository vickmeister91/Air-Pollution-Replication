In a recent court order, the State of Rajasthan was directed to safeguard the call details of a recovery officer and other individuals in connection with an FIR registered at Police Station Ratahanjna, District Pratapgarh. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by Raju Lal, who had requested the court to summon the call details under Section 91-311 Cr.P.C. and Section 165 of the Evidence Act.

The court directed the trial court to ensure that the call details were kept in a sealed cover in the record of the court, if available, for their availability at the requisite time, if required. The petition was disposed of with these directions.

The order is significant because it highlights the importance of protecting sensitive information in legal proceedings. Call details can provide crucial evidence in criminal cases, and it is essential that they are safeguarded to prevent tampering or manipulation.

The court's decision to keep the call details in a sealed cover is a common practice in legal proceedings. It ensures that the information is available if required but also protects it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

The order also demonstrates the court's commitment to upholding the rights of individuals in legal proceedings. By allowing the petitioner to access the call details, the court has ensured that all parties have access to the evidence necessary to make informed decisions.

Overall, the court order is a reminder of the importance of protecting sensitive information in legal proceedings. It highlights the need for courts to take proactive steps to safeguard evidence and ensure that all parties have access to the information necessary to make informed decisions.
