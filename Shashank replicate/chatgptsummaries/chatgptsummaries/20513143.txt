The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Satya Narayan regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court also noted that one of the related cases, WP No. 718/2009, had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state has planned to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal to prevent contamination. The court also directs the state and local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and to make citizens aware of this direction. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the state fails to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for the removal of encroachments and contamination. The court also directs the District Collector, Ganga Nagar to be present on the next posting date. The state is directed to remove all encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through the municipal areas.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water in Sriganganagar. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to pollution and to show cause as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The court observed that the notices issued were not in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal. The State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, or appropriate action would be taken. The court also directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water.

The court order gives the Counsel for the State another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal to provide information and records relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which it can be ignored.

The court order states that the petitioner is seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concludes that the jurisdiction vested with the tribunal is very wide and that the cause agitated by the original applicant is within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December, 2016.
