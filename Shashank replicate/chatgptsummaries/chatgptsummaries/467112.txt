The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri H G Rangangoud against the Karnataka Lokayukta and other government bodies. The petitioner had been granted a mining lease for extracting iron ore, which was renewed for a further period of twenty years. However, the Lokayukta report alleged that the petitioner had encroached upon forest land and carried out illegal mining activities. The court considered the contentions of both parties and observed that there was prima facie evidence to show that the petitioner had encroached upon forest land and operated outside the limits of the leased out area. The court held that the authorities were duty-bound to prevent such illegal encroachment and mining operations and initiate criminal action against the petitioner.

The court order discusses various issues related to illegal mining in a forest area. The court holds that there is a variation between the field sketch and agreements entered between the petitioner and forest department, and the satellite imagery in the Lokayukta report. The court also discusses the power of judicial review and the need for caution in its exercise. The court orders an inspection of the area leased out to the petitioner and directs the forest authorities to permit the petitioner to undertake mining operations in the leased out area. The court also allows the respondents to initiate appropriate action against the petitioner, including filing an FIR.
