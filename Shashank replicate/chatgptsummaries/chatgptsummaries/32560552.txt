The court order in question pertains to two repeat bail applications filed by Jeevan and Hukum, who are accused of violating The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that a leopard skin was found in a bag belonging to Jeevan during a search. The court notes that the minimum sentence for the offence is three years and the maximum is seven years.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and the defence, rejected the bail applications. The court observed that the accused had already been granted bail once before, and that they had violated the conditions of their bail by not appearing in court on the scheduled dates. The court also noted that the accused had not cooperated with the investigation and had not provided any information about the source of the leopard skin.

The court further observed that the offence in question was a serious one, and that the accused had been found in possession of a protected animal. The court noted that the Wildlife Protection Act was enacted to protect endangered species and to prevent their illegal trade. The court also noted that the offence was non-bailable, and that the accused had failed to show any exceptional circumstances that would warrant the grant of bail.

The court directed the trial court to expedite the trial and conclude it within three months. The court observed that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period of time, and that it was in the interest of justice to conclude the trial as soon as possible. The court also directed the trial court to ensure that the witnesses were examined expeditiously and that there were no unnecessary delays in the trial.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to two repeat bail applications filed by Jeevan and Hukum, who are accused of violating The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court rejected the bail applications and directed the trial court to expedite the trial and conclude it within three months. The court observed that the offence in question was a serious one, and that the accused had been found in possession of a protected animal. The court also noted that the accused had not cooperated with the investigation and had not provided any information about the source of the leopard skin. The court's decision reflects the seriousness with which the judiciary views offences against wildlife and the need to protect endangered species.
