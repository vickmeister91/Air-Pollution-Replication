The Supreme Court of India received a writ petition from the Occupational Health and Safety Association, seeking guidelines for occupational safety and health regulations to be maintained by various industries, the appointment of a committee to monitor the working of thermal power plants in India, compensation for workers who are victims of occupational health disorders, and the notification of recommendations as guidelines to be followed by thermal power plants. The court ordered comprehensive medical checkups for workers, free and comprehensive medical treatment for workers found to be suffering from occupational diseases, and compensation for workers suffering from occupational diseases. The court also ordered the appointment of a committee of experts to look into the issue of health and safety of workers and make recommendations.

The court emphasized the importance of protecting the health and safety of workers in hazardous and risky jobs, particularly in coal-fired thermal power plants (CFTPPs). The order cited various health hazards associated with CFTPPs, including dust-related diseases, heat-related disorders, noise-induced hearing loss, and exposure to chemicals and radiation. The court recommended safe methods for handling hazardous waste and the appointment of a committee of experts to look into health and safety issues. The order also called for the implementation of environmental and occupational health and safety management systems in CFTPPs.

The court order also discussed the risks of fire and explosion in CFTPPs and the potential health hazards faced by workers in these plants. The court recommended protective measures for health and safety, emergency preparedness, and social welfare. However, it was not practical for the court to examine whether CFTPPs were complying with safety standards and regulations throughout the country. Therefore, the court relegated the responsibility to examine these issues to the respective High Courts in whose jurisdiction the power plants were situated. The High Courts should examine whether there is an adequate health delivery system in place, evaluate the occupational health status of workers, and ensure effective medical treatment is provided. The court also recommended that the National Institute of Occupational Health's report be made available to the High Courts.

The court held that the right to health and medical care to protect one's health and vigor is a fundamental right of a worker under Article 21 read with Articles 39(e), 41, 43, 48-A, and all related articles and fundamental human rights to make the life of the workman meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person. The writ petition was disposed of.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India ordered comprehensive medical checkups, free and comprehensive medical treatment, and compensation for workers suffering from occupational diseases. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the health and safety of workers in hazardous and risky jobs, particularly in coal-fired thermal power plants. The court recommended safe methods for handling hazardous waste and the appointment of a committee of experts to look into health and safety issues.
