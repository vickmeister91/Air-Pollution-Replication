The court order pertains to a series of writ petitions filed by autonomous colleges affiliated to Calicut University, challenging the university's refusal to issue orders as directed in previous judgments of the court. The colleges had been granted autonomous status by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and were aggrieved by the university's insistence on affiliation for approval of new academic programs, which they claimed was in violation of the Calicut University Act and UGC guidelines.

The court disposed of all four petitions by a common judgment. The court order discusses the guidelines and regulations issued by the UGC for autonomous colleges, which include the role of parent universities, starting new courses, and review and restructuring of existing courses. The UGC regulations are issued to ensure coordination and determination of standards in higher education institutions, and both universities and autonomous colleges are bound by them. The need for autonomy is described as a way to modernize curricula and make them locally relevant, and to allow colleges to offer programs of a higher standard.

The court order discusses a dispute between a petitioner and a university regarding the requirement of affiliation for academic programs in autonomous colleges. The petitioner argues that affiliation is not necessary and cites UGC guidelines and regulations to support their case. The university argues that affiliation is required for autonomous colleges and that the role of the university cannot be limited to stamping decisions made by autonomous colleges. The court examines the UGC guidelines and regulations and concludes that affiliation is not necessary for autonomous colleges. The court also notes that the university has not communicated any decision to the colleges in question.

The court order discusses several writ petitions filed by autonomous colleges challenging the requirement of affiliation for starting new academic programs. The court refers to a previous judgment in Rajagiri College's case, which held that autonomous colleges do not require affiliation from the university to start new programs. The court also notes that the University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued regulations in 2018 that support this position. The court orders the university to follow the previous judgment and the UGC regulations and not require affiliation for autonomous colleges to start new programs.

The court order pertains to a dispute between a college seeking approval for new academic programs and the Calicut University, which rejected the proposal citing non-compliance with affiliation requirements. The petitioner challenged this decision, arguing that it violated UGC guidelines and the University Act. The court set aside the rejection and directed the University to consider the proposal within the prescribed time frame. However, the University failed to take a decision within the stipulated time, prompting the petitioner to file a fresh petition seeking relief. The University argued that the petitioner had not submitted a statutory application for the proposed programs within the prescribed time frame and that concurrence from the government was necessary. The court is yet to make a final decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the guidelines set by the UGC for de-centralization of structured curriculum education, enabling higher standards in autonomous institutions. The court rejects the contention that an application for affiliation is required under Chapter XXIII of the First Statutes, as it conflicts with the de-centralization attempted by the scheme for autonomy. The court also discusses the provisions in Section 118 of the MG University Act and Section 68Q of the Calicut University Act regarding the approval of academic programs by the Board of Studies. The court concludes that the refusal to grant approval for want of application for affiliation is unsustainable and that a decision is required on the proposal by the Board of Studies.

The court order states that colleges with autonomous status have a responsibility to promote academic excellence, and any delay in decision-making regarding academic programs would be contrary to this purpose. The University must encourage innovative academic programs in these colleges and cannot reject proposals unless they do not conform to university standards. The Board of Studies must make decisions on proposals strictly in accordance with the law. The University must place proposals before the Board of Studies for approval of academic programs and communicate decisions to the colleges without insisting on affiliation. The order includes a list of exhibits presented by both the petitioners and respondents.

The court order includes several exhibits, such as copies of minutes from governing and academic councils, guidelines for autonomous colleges, communication from the first respondent to the government, and UGC regulations and guidelines. It also includes photocopies of orders, recommendations, judgments, covering letters, and minutes of various meetings related to the petitioner's college and its autonomous status.

In summary, the court order deals with a series of writ petitions filed by autonomous colleges affiliated to Calicut University, challenging the university's insistence on affiliation for approval of new academic programs. The court examines the UGC guidelines and regulations and concludes that affiliation is not necessary for autonomous colleges. The court orders the university to follow the previous judgment and the UGC regulations and not require affiliation for autonomous colleges to start new programs. The court also directs the University to consider proposals for new academic programs within the prescribed time frame and communicate decisions to the colleges without insisting on affiliation. The court emphasizes the responsibility of colleges with autonomous status to promote academic excellence and the need for the Board of Studies to make decisions on proposals strictly in accordance with the law. The court order includes several exhibits related to the case.
