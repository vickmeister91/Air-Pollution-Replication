The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Satish Kumar against a summary judgment passed by a lower court. The appellant had been convicted and fined for driving a bus without producing the prescribed Proforma of his being authorized driver by the STA in violation of the directions of the Supreme Court of India. The appellant argued that he had inadvertently shown an old Proforma which had expired and in fact, he was also in possession of a new Proforma valid till 23.4.2012. 

The court found that the appellant was in possession of the prescribed Proforma and therefore, the conviction could not be sustained. The appeal was allowed, and the impugned summary judgment was set aside. The appellant was refunded the fine of Rs. 5000/- paid by him.

The case highlights the importance of following the prescribed procedures and guidelines when it comes to driving commercial vehicles. The Supreme Court of India has issued directions in this regard, and it is the responsibility of drivers to ensure that they comply with these directions. Failure to do so can result in fines and even criminal convictions.

In this case, the appellant was able to successfully argue that he had inadvertently shown an old Proforma, and that he was in fact in possession of the correct Proforma. This highlights the importance of keeping up-to-date records and documentation when it comes to driving commercial vehicles.

The court's decision to allow the appeal and set aside the summary judgment is significant, as it demonstrates the importance of ensuring that justice is served in all cases. The court found that the appellant had not committed the offence he was accused of, and therefore, it was only right that the conviction be overturned and the fine refunded.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following the prescribed procedures and guidelines when it comes to driving commercial vehicles. It also highlights the importance of keeping up-to-date records and documentation, and the need for justice to be served in all cases.
