The Bombay High Court recently disposed of a public interest petition filed by Shri. Mohan Ramanna Sutar against Shri. Pandurang Saharkari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. and others. The petitioner had requested that action be taken against Respondent No.2 for violating various norms, and that Respondent No.1 strictly abide by environmental pollution and air pollution control laws.

The court found that nothing remained to be done regarding Respondent No.1, and that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board would take necessary action if any violations were found. The petition was therefore disposed of.

The petitioner had alleged that Respondent No.2 had violated various norms, including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's consent conditions, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner had also alleged that Respondent No.1 had not taken adequate measures to control pollution and had not complied with the conditions of the consent granted by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.

The court noted that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had already taken action against Respondent No.2 for violating the consent conditions. The court also noted that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had conducted inspections of Respondent No.1's premises and had issued show cause notices for non-compliance with the consent conditions.

The court observed that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board was the appropriate authority to take action against any violations of environmental pollution and air pollution control laws. The court also noted that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had the power to revoke the consent granted to Respondent No.1 if it was found to be in violation of the conditions.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that Respondent No.1 was violating any environmental pollution or air pollution control laws. The court noted that the petitioner had only made general allegations and had not provided any specific instances of violations.

The court therefore found that nothing remained to be done regarding Respondent No.1, and that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board would take necessary action if any violations were found. The court disposed of the petition accordingly.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court disposed of a public interest petition filed by Shri. Mohan Ramanna Sutar against Shri. Pandurang Saharkari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. and others.
