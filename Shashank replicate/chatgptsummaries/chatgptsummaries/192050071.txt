The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab, Chandigarh, recently heard a consumer complaint filed by Gurdarshan Singh against The Sherwood Officers Society and others. Singh had paid Rs. 27.81 lakh for a residential plot, but the society failed to develop the land and hand over possession within the stipulated period. Singh sought a refund of the amount paid, along with interest, compensation for mental harassment, litigation expenses, and counsel fees. The commission allowed both parties to present evidence to prove their contentions.

The court order states that in case of any dispute among the members or governing body of a society, the matter should be referred to the principal court of original civil jurisdiction. The court also clarifies that the Consumer Fora has jurisdiction to deal with complaints against cooperative societies if they have assured services to their members and failed to deliver them. The court cites various judgments to support its decision. The order also discusses a case where a complainant had paid money to a society for a plot, but the society did not have the necessary certificates and approvals to offer the plot for sale.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed against a real estate developer for unfair trade practices and deficiency in service. The court found that the developer had not obtained necessary permissions and had failed to complete the project within the stipulated time, and therefore ordered the developer to refund the complainant's money with interest, pay compensation for mental tension and harassment caused, and pay litigation costs. The court also noted that the developer had charged interest at 12% on late payments, and therefore was liable to pay the same interest to the complainant.

The court order in this case clarifies that in case of any dispute among the members or governing body of a society, the matter should be referred to the principal court of original civil jurisdiction.

In the second case, a complaint was filed against a real estate developer for unfair trade practices and deficiency in service. The court found that the developer had not obtained necessary permissions and had failed to complete the project within the stipulated time. Therefore, the court ordered the developer to refund the complainant's money with interest, pay compensation for mental tension and harassment caused, and pay litigation costs. The court also noted that the developer had charged interest at 12% on late payments, and therefore was liable to pay the same interest to the complainant.

The court order in the second case highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and completing projects within the stipulated time. It also emphasizes the need for developers to refrain from unfair trade practices and to provide adequate compensation for mental tension and harassment caused to consumers. The court's decision to order the developer to refund the complainant's money with interest and pay litigation costs serves as a warning to other developers to comply with regulations and provide quality services to consumers.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed above highlight the importance of consumer protection and the need for developers and societies to comply with regulations and provide quality services to consumers.

The court's clarification on the jurisdiction of Consumer Fora in dealing with complaints against cooperative societies also serves as a guide for consumers seeking redressal for grievances against such societies.
