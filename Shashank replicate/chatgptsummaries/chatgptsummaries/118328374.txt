The National Green Tribunal in Pune heard several applications related to pollution caused by brick kilns and the environmental impacts of operating them without necessary permissions from regulatory bodies. The applications involved several respondents, including the State of Maharashtra and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The court issued a common judgment on February 24, 2014.

One of the cases involved a writ petition filed by Sonyabapu seeking an injunction against Sitabai for running a brick kiln without valid permission on agricultural land. The petitioner alleged that the brick kiln was being operated illegally and in violation of guidelines issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The petitioner also claimed that the brick kiln was causing pollution and endangering the health and life of nearby residents. The court was tasked with deciding on the issues raised in the application.

In another case, the court discussed a writ petition filed in Aurangabad, which had been transferred to the tribunal. The case involved a dispute over the operation of a traditional brick kiln and its impact on the environment. The respondent, Sitabai, claimed to have obtained necessary permissions for the kiln and denied causing any pollution. The court noted that the parties had already gone through one round of civil litigation and considered whether any standards were prescribed for traditional brick kilns and whether the MPCB was the licensing authority for such industries. The court also referred to an MPCB report from 2006 that found the brick kiln to be operating within prescribed standards.

In another case, the court discussed two separate applications regarding brick-kilns causing environmental damage. In the first application, the court found that the brick-kiln in question was causing nuisance to the residents due to smoke emissions and was ordered to be closed. The court also noted that the owner did not have a valid permission to run the brick-kiln. In the second application, the court found that the brick-kilns operated by the respondents were causing serious pollution and health hazards in the surrounding area, and the solid waste from the brick-kilns was being disposed of improperly. The court emphasized that running brick-kilns without proper permissions and causing environmental damage is a threat to the environment, and actual loss or damage need not be established.

In another case, the court discussed a situation where a brick kiln operator was causing environmental degradation and health hazards due to improper disposal of solid waste and emissions of air pollutants. The applicant had complained to the authorities, but no action had been taken. The respondent claimed to be operating their traditional brick kilns legally and not using banned fuels. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties, including maps and land records, to determine the impact of the brick kilns on the surrounding area.

In another case, the court discussed two applications regarding the operation of brick kilns and their impact on the environment and agriculture fields. The court considered whether the kilns were being run in breach of environmental norms and whether they should be closed down. The court noted that the MPCB had issued guidelines for running brick kilns and that there were five types of kilns. The court also considered whether the directions of the CPCB regarding the classification of industries into Red, Orange, and Green categories apply to traditional country-type brick kilns. The MPCB was asked to clarify whether any particular emission standards were prescribed or likely to be prescribed and whether any consent was necessary for such type of brick kilns from the MPCB.

In another case, the court discussed the issue of brick kilns falling under the Orange category Units and the need for them to obtain consent from the MPCB. The court noted that the MPCB had changed its stance on the matter and had directed all Regional Officers and Sub-Regional Officers to cover such activities under consent management. However, the court found it difficult to understand how the Board could make such a decision without first stipulating emission standards and other environmental safeguards. The court emphasized the need for the State Pollution Control Board to formulate and stipulate air emission standards and other environmental safeguards for such brick kilns before implementing the decision of the MPCB. The court also discussed the Precautionary Principle and the concept of sustainable development in relation to environmental disputes.

The court order stated that while employment opportunities and revenue generation cannot be ignored, there must be a balance struck between economic interests and environmental protection. The court found that the brick kilns in question were operating illegally and posed a threat to the environment and surrounding areas. The court ordered the brick kilns to be shut down and for the necessary emissions standards and environmental safeguards to be put in place. The court allowed the brick kilns to apply for permission to operate if they met relevant norms and conditions to avoid environmental damage. The order was allowed with certain conditions and no costs.
