The case in question involves a revision petition filed by the petitioner, Mohd. Yunus, against an order passed by the Special Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Cases), Udaipur. The order dismissed Yunus' application under Sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. Yunus argued that the complainant filed a false complaint against him and that the appellate court wrongly rejected his application for summoning a witness.

The court, however, dismissed the revision petition, stating that the accused cannot make out a new case at the appellate stage and that the appellate court rightly rejected the application. This decision was based on the fact that the accused had already been given an opportunity to present his case before the lower court and that the appellate court had no reason to believe that the lower court had erred in its decision.

The petitioner's argument that the complainant filed a false complaint against him was not considered by the court, as it was not relevant to the issue at hand. The court's decision was based solely on the fact that the petitioner had already been given an opportunity to present his case before the lower court and that the appellate court had no reason to believe that the lower court had erred in its decision.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of criminal law, which require that the accused be given a fair trial and that the prosecution be given an opportunity to present its case. The court's decision also reflects the importance of the appellate process in ensuring that justice is served.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the revision petition filed by Mohd. Yunus is based on sound legal principles and reflects the importance of the appellate process in ensuring that justice is served. While the petitioner's argument that the complainant filed a false complaint against him was not considered by the court, this was not relevant to the issue at hand and did not affect the court's decision.
