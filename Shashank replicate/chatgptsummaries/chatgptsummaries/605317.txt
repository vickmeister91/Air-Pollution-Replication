In a recent court order, the dispute between Bharti Air Tel Ltd and Thrikkakkara Grama Panchayat was resolved. The court quashed an order passed by the Panchayat and allowed the energization of towers that had already been constructed, subject to certain observations and directions. The court also allowed the parties to bear their respective costs.

The case revolved around the construction of mobile towers by Bharti Air Tel Ltd in Thrikkakkara Grama Panchayat. The Panchayat had issued an order directing the company to stop the construction of the towers and to remove the ones that had already been constructed. The Panchayat had cited various reasons for its decision, including concerns about the impact of the towers on the environment and public health.

Bharti Air Tel Ltd challenged the Panchayat's order in court, arguing that it had obtained all the necessary permissions and clearances from the relevant authorities before commencing the construction of the towers. The company also contended that the Panchayat's order was arbitrary and without any basis in law.

After hearing both sides, the court quashed the Panchayat's order and allowed the energization of the towers that had already been constructed. However, the court also imposed certain conditions and directions that the company had to comply with before energizing the towers. These conditions included obtaining clearances from the relevant authorities and complying with all the applicable laws and regulations.

The court also observed that the Panchayat had acted beyond its jurisdiction in passing the order to stop the construction of the towers. The court noted that the Panchayat did not have the power to regulate the construction of mobile towers, as this fell within the purview of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The court also observed that the Panchayat had not followed the due process of law before passing the order.

In light of these observations, the court directed the Panchayat to refrain from interfering with the construction of mobile towers in the future. The court also directed the Panchayat to follow the due process of law before passing any orders that affect the rights of private parties.

Finally, the court allowed the parties to bear their respective costs. This means that each party will have to pay for its own legal expenses and other costs incurred during the course of the litigation.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between Bharti Air Tel Ltd and Thrikkakkara Grama Panchayat has resolved the dispute between the parties. The court has allowed the energization of towers that had already been constructed, subject to certain conditions and directions. The court has also directed the Panchayat to refrain from interfering with the construction of mobile towers in the future and to follow the due process of law before passing any orders that affect the rights of private parties.
