The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Delhi recently heard an appeal by the Revenue against the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1990-91 in the matter of imposition of penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. The only grievance of the Revenue relates to the action of the CIT(A) for deleting the penalty of Rs. 88,40,715 imposed by the AO under Section 271(1)(c). The case concerned the disallowance of depreciation claimed by the assessee on a biogas plant. The AO imposed a penalty on account of the above disallowance of depreciation holding that the appellant has reduced its tax liability by furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The CIT(A) deleted the penalty after having made the observation that the claim of depreciation made during the year on biogas plant was bona fide and not with any mala fide intention and has thus discharged the onus cast on it under Expln. 1 to Section 271(1)(c). The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the Revenue.

The case in question pertains to the imposition of a penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The appellant had claimed depreciation on a biogas plant, which was disallowed by the Assessing Officer (AO). The AO imposed a penalty on the appellant for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income, which resulted in a reduction of tax liability. The penalty was subsequently deleted by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)].

The Revenue filed an appeal against the order of the CIT(A) before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Delhi. The only issue before the ITAT was the deletion of the penalty by the CIT(A). The ITAT observed that the CIT(A) had deleted the penalty after considering the claim of depreciation made by the appellant on the biogas plant. The CIT(A) had held that the claim was bona fide and not made with any mala fide intention. The ITAT noted that the CIT(A) had discharged the onus cast on the appellant under Explanation 1 to Section 271(1)(c) of the Act.

The ITAT further observed that the penalty under Section 271(1)(c) can be imposed only if the Assessing Officer is satisfied that the appellant has concealed the particulars of income or furnished inaccurate particulars of income. The ITAT noted that the appellant had claimed depreciation on the biogas plant, which was disallowed by the AO. The ITAT held that the claim of depreciation made by the appellant was a debatable issue and cannot be said to be a case of furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The ITAT also noted that the CIT(A) had deleted the penalty after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and had arrived at a plausible view. The ITAT held that the order of the CIT(A) did not suffer from any infirmity and dismissed the appeal of the Revenue.

In conclusion, the ITAT in Delhi recently dismissed an appeal by the Revenue against the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1990-91 in the matter of imposition of penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. The case concerned the disallowance of depreciation claimed by the appellant on a biogas plant. The AO had imposed a penalty on the appellant for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income, which was subsequently deleted by the CIT(A). The ITAT upheld the order of the CIT(A) and held that the claim of depreciation made by the appellant was a debatable issue and cannot be said to be a case of furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The ITAT also noted that the CIT(A) had arrived at a plausible view after considering the facts and circumstances of the case.
