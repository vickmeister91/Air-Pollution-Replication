The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Idu Musalman, who has been in custody since August 22, 2015, for a crime registered at Police Station Rithi, Sanweri, District Katni. The charges against him include Sections 304, 201/34 of IPC, Section 25/27 of Arms Act, and Sections 9, 51, 52 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicant on furnishing a bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the CJM Katni. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective.

Idu Musalman had been in custody for over five years, and his bail application had been pending for a long time. The charges against him were severe, including murder, destruction of evidence, illegal possession of arms, and violation of wildlife protection laws. However, the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that Idu Musalman was guilty of the charges against him. Therefore, the court allowed his bail application and directed his release on certain conditions.

The court directed Idu Musalman to furnish a bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the CJM Katni. This condition was imposed to ensure that Idu Musalman would appear in court whenever required and would not abscond. The court also made it clear that the bail order would be effective until the end of the trial. However, if Idu Musalman were to jump bail, the order would become ineffective, and he would be liable to be arrested again.

The court's decision to grant bail to Idu Musalman was based on the evidence presented before it. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that Idu Musalman was guilty of the charges against him. The court also took into account the fact that Idu Musalman had been in custody for over five years and that his bail application had been pending for a long time. Therefore, the court decided to grant him bail.
