The first court order pertains to an application for suspension of sentence awarded to the appellant Ajit R. Kyal in a corruption case. The sentence awarded was one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2 lakhs for one offence and four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 4 lakhs for another offence. The appellant had not paid the fine till date. The appellant's counsel argued that the only act attributable to him was issuing six cheques that were misused by other accused, and there was no evidence of criminal conspiracy. The counsel also sought suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal. The court refused to suspend the sentence at this stage and referred to the impugned judgment that discussed the role played by the appellant in the conspiracy.

The second court order pertains to a case where the accused, A2, issued cheques for large amounts to M/s Nexus Remedies Private Limited (A-6) without any proper recommendation or sanctioned limit. The accused claimed that the cheques were issued as advance security, but failed to provide any evidence to support this claim. The court found circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy involving A2, A3, and A4, and dismissed the accused's application for release on bail. The appeal against this decision was also dismissed.

In the first case, the appellant Ajit R. Kyal was convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2 lakhs for one offence and four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 4 lakhs for another offence. The appellant had not paid the fine till date. The appellant's counsel argued that the only act attributable to him was issuing six cheques that were misused by other accused, and there was no evidence of criminal conspiracy. The counsel also sought suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal. However, the court refused to suspend the sentence at this stage and referred to the impugned judgment that discussed the role played by the appellant in the conspiracy.

The court found that the appellant had played an active role in the conspiracy and had issued the cheques with the knowledge that they would be misused. The court also noted that the appellant had not paid the fine imposed on him, which showed his lack of remorse for his actions. Therefore, the court held that the appellant did not deserve any leniency at this stage and refused to suspend the sentence.

In the second case, the accused A2 had issued cheques for large amounts to M/s Nexus Remedies Private Limited (A-6) without any proper recommendation or sanctioned limit. The accused claimed that the cheques were issued as advance security, but failed to provide any evidence to support this claim. The court found circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy involving A2, A3, and A4, and dismissed the accused's application for release on bail. The appeal against this decision was also dismissed.

The court found that the accused had issued the cheques without any proper authorization and had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that they were issued as advance security. The court also found circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy involving the accused and other co-accused. Therefore, the court held that the accused did not deserve to be released on bail and dismissed his application.

In both cases, the courts have taken a strict view of the offences committed by the accused and have refused to grant any leniency. The courts have also taken into account the evidence presented before them and have found the accused guilty of the offences charged. These court orders serve as a reminder that corruption and financial crimes will not be tolerated and that those who commit such offences will be punished.
