The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by Additional Session Judge No.2, Jhunjhunu. The order in question dismissed the petitioner's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner is currently facing trial in a case arising out of FIR No.373/2008 registered at the instance of Smt. Saroj Devi.

During the proceedings, the petitioner's counsel argued that a report submitted by Chukki Devi, who had suffered injuries in the same incident, was not admissible as evidence since Chukki Devi had passed away and the author of the previous statement was not available. The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the prayer made by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be entertained.

Section 91 Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner had sought to rely on this provision to obtain the report submitted by Chukki Devi.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to establish that the report submitted by Chukki Devi was necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the report through other means, such as by approaching the police or the investigating officer.

The court's decision highlights the importance of establishing the relevance and necessity of any document or material sought to be produced under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The provision cannot be used as a tool to obtain any and all documents or materials that may be remotely connected to a case.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to litigants and their counsel to carefully consider the relevance and necessity of any material sought to be produced under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before making an application to the court. Failure to do so may result in the dismissal of the application and the loss of an opportunity to obtain important evidence in support of one's case.
