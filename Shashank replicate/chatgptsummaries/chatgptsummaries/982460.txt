The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against M/s Nicosulf Industries & Export Pvt. Ltd. and its co-directors for discharging polluted water without prior permission or approval. The lower court had convicted the accused, but the Gujarat High Court allowed the revision petition filed by the respondents. The main ground of challenge was that the complainant had no authority to file the complaint. The Supreme Court was approached to settle the matter.

The Supreme Court held that the delegation of the power of sanctioning prosecution in favor of the Chairman was valid and effective, and the complaint was filed by a competent person. The respondents were found guilty of discharging effluent into the drain leading to the solar evaporation pan without conforming to the tolerance limits prescribed. The court found that the respondents had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The respondents were directed to pay a fine of Rs. 1 lakh each, and in case of default, they were to undergo imprisonment for six months.

The second court order discusses a case where a company was accused of discharging effluent into a drain leading to a solar evaporation pan. The court found that there was no evidence that the sample taken was of the overflown effluent, and therefore, the alleged breach of condition No.4 was not proved. The court also discussed the authorization of the complaint and concluded that the appeal should be dismissed.

The court observed that the complainant had the power to file the complaint under Section 33A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also noted that the complainant had followed the procedure prescribed under the law and had obtained the necessary sanction for filing the complaint. The court held that the authorization of the complaint was valid and that the lower court had rightly convicted the accused.

The court further observed that the accused had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court directed the accused to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000 each, and in case of default, they were to undergo imprisonment for three months.

In both cases, the courts have taken a strict view of the violation of environmental laws. The courts have emphasized the need to protect the environment and have held the accused responsible for their actions. The courts have also emphasized the need for strict compliance with the provisions of the law and have held that the authorization of the complaint is a crucial aspect of the legal process.

The courts have also imposed fines and imprisonment as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to violate environmental laws. The courts have sent a strong message that environmental violations will not be tolerated, and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and the need for strict compliance with environmental laws. The courts have emphasized the need for authorization of complaints and have held that the complainant must follow the procedure prescribed under the law. The courts have also imposed fines and imprisonment as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to violate environmental laws. The court orders serve as a reminder that environmental violations will not be tolerated, and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.
