The case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Mr. P.D. Bohra under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Sessions Judge and the Judicial Magistrate in the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881. The petitioner had moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon the cash-book and ledger of the complainant-respondent No.2, which was rejected by the trial court. The respondent No.2 informed the court that the documents sought to be summoned were destroyed by him. The petitioner argued that adverse inference should be taken against the respondent if he relies on the said documents in the future. The court dismissed the petition, stating that appropriate action will be taken if the respondent relies on the documents in the future.

The Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, is an important piece of legislation that governs the use of negotiable instruments such as cheques, promissory notes, and bills of exchange. Section 138 of the Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The provision makes it a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. The provision has been enacted to ensure that cheques are honoured promptly and that the credibility of the banking system is maintained.

In the present case, the petitioner had moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon the cash-book and ledger of the complainant-respondent No.2. Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The trial court, however, rejected the application on the ground that the documents sought to be summoned were destroyed by the respondent No.2.

The petitioner argued that adverse inference should be taken against the respondent if he relies on the said documents in the future. Adverse inference is a legal principle that allows a court to draw an inference against a party who fails to produce evidence that is in his possession or control. The principle is based on the maxim "Omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem," which means that everything is presumed against a wrongdoer.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that appropriate action will be taken if the respondent relies on the documents in the future. The court's decision is based on the principle that a court should not interfere with the trial court's decision unless there is a manifest error or a grave injustice. The court has also taken note of the fact that the respondent has informed the court that the documents sought to be summoned were destroyed by him. The court has, therefore, left it to the trial court to decide whether adverse inference should be drawn against the respondent if he relies on the said documents in the future.

In conclusion, the case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Mr. P.D. Bohra under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Sessions Judge and the Judicial Magistrate in the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881.
