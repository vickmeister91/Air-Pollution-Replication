In the first court order, a landlord filed a petition against a tenant for non-payment of rent and subletting the property without consent. The court found that the property was not in a slum area and the tenant had not paid rent since 1999 despite receiving a legal demand notice. The court ruled in favor of the landlord and ordered the tenant to vacate the property.

The second court order allows a petition under section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act, as all the requirements have been met. The respondent is directed to pay the legally recoverable rent for the last three years from the filing of the present petition. The order under section 15(1) of the DRC Act is modified accordingly. However, the petition under section 14(1)(b) of the DRC Act is dismissed as the petitioner failed to prove that the respondent had sublet, assigned, or parted with the shop in question.

The first court order deals with a landlord-tenant dispute where the tenant had not paid rent since 1999 and had sublet the property without the landlord's consent. The court found that the property was not in a slum area and ruled in favor of the landlord, ordering the tenant to vacate the property. This order highlights the importance of paying rent on time and seeking the landlord's consent before subletting the property.

The second court order deals with a petition filed under section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act, which allows a landlord to seek eviction of a tenant for non-payment of rent. The court found that all the requirements had been met and directed the respondent to pay the legally recoverable rent for the last three years from the filing of the present petition. The order under section 15(1) of the DRC Act, which deals with the deposit of rent, was modified accordingly. However, the petition under section 14(1)(b) of the DRC Act, which allows a landlord to seek eviction of a tenant for subletting, assigning, or parting with the property without consent, was dismissed as the petitioner failed to prove that the respondent had done so.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of following the legal procedures and fulfilling the requirements under the DRC Act. Landlords must ensure that their tenants pay rent on time and seek their consent before subletting the property. Tenants must also be aware of their rights and obligations under the law. Failure to comply with the legal requirements can result in eviction and other legal consequences.
