In a recent court order, a writ petition filed by Mr. Ravinder Bhardwaj against the Commissioner of Police and Assistant Commissioner of Police in Bengaluru was dismissed. The petitioner had sought to quash a notice issued under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which directed him to produce a Lamborghini Gallardo car. However, the court dismissed the petition as the dispute had been settled and the petition had become infructuous.

The case began when Mr. Bhardwaj received a notice from the police under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the police to issue a notice to produce any document or thing that is necessary for an investigation. In this case, the police had directed Mr. Bhardwaj to produce his Lamborghini Gallardo car.

Mr. Bhardwaj filed a writ petition in the court seeking to quash the notice. He argued that the notice was illegal and arbitrary as he had already provided all the necessary documents and information to the police. He also claimed that the notice was issued with mala fide intentions to harass him.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and observed that the dispute between Mr. Bhardwaj and the police had been settled. The court noted that Mr. Bhardwaj had already produced the necessary documents and information to the police, and the police had no further need for the car. Therefore, the court held that the petition had become infructuous and dismissed it.

The court's decision was based on the principle of mootness, which means that a case becomes moot when the dispute between the parties has been resolved or when the relief sought by the petitioner is no longer necessary. In this case, the court found that the dispute had been settled and the relief sought by Mr. Bhardwaj was no longer necessary.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of mootness and emphasizes the importance of resolving disputes between parties. It also highlights the need for police to act in a fair and reasonable manner when issuing notices under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
