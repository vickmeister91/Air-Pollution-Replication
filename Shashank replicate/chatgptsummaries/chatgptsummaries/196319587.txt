The Supreme Court of India recently issued several court orders related to disputes over the construction of a temple on protected forest land in Madhya Pradesh. The first court order pertains to a writ petition challenging an order passed by the National Green Tribunal to maintain status quo with regard to a piece of land and to ensure that no trees are cut and no construction is carried out contrary to the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The case has a history of litigation, with the Archaeological Survey of India filing a writ petition in 2006 seeking action against the petitioner for cutting down trees on protected forest land. The writ petitions were dismissed in 2012, but the court directed that the respondent-Trust cannot proceed with construction without obtaining permission from the State Government.

The second court order sets a time limit for the Trust to submit an application to raise the construction of a temple to protect and preserve the idol of 'Bade Baba'. If the State Government refuses permission, the Trust must restore the construction to its previous state. The order also discusses the history of the land and monuments in question, including previous legal challenges. The Supreme Court has directed that if the Government approves the construction, the appellants shall not be allowed to challenge it again.

The third court order discusses a series of legal proceedings related to the construction of a temple on a disputed land in Madhya Pradesh. The Supreme Court dismissed a writ petition and advised the petitioner to approach the High Court instead. The petitioner filed a writ petition in the High Court, which was also dismissed. Later, an application was filed before the National Green Tribunal by a society claiming that the temple construction should be stopped. The petitioner challenged the locus standi of the society to file the application. The Tribunal initially passed an order to adjourn the matter, and later allowed an impleadment application filed by the petitioner. The impugned order was passed by the Tribunal, which is being challenged by the petitioner. The petitioner argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute over the subject matter, which was already decided by the competent court of jurisdiction.

The fourth court order states that the Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction over a matter that has already been concluded by an order of the court and affirmed by the Supreme Court. The court found that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was invoked to circumvent the bar put by the Supreme Court and was not done in a bona-fide manner. The court quashed all subsequent proceedings and ordered the Respondent No.1 and 2 to pay a cost of Rs.50,000/- each to the petitioner within three months.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complex legal issues surrounding the construction of a temple on protected forest land in Madhya Pradesh. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary permissions before proceeding with construction. Additionally, the court has made it clear that jurisdictional issues must be carefully considered and that parties cannot circumvent previous court orders. These court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of respecting legal processes and upholding the rule of law.
