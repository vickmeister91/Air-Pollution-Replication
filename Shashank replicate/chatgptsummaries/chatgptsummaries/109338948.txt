The Haryana State Pollution Control Board filed a complaint against Ms. Sobha Tuli for constructing a farm house in violation of a notification.

The accused was acquitted of the charge. 

The Haryana State Pollution Control Board filed a complaint against Ms. Sobha Tuli for constructing a farm house in violation of a notification. The notification in question was issued by the Haryana Government in 1992, which prohibited the construction of any building within 50 meters of a water body. The complaint alleged that Ms. Tuli had constructed a farm house within 50 meters of a water body, in violation of the notification.

Ms. Tuli was summoned to face trial and was admitted to bail. The trial court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the notification was applicable to the accused's land and that the construction was made after the issuance of the notification. The court noted that the notification did not specify the water body to which it applied, and that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to show that the water body in question was covered by the notification. The court also noted that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to show that the construction was made after the issuance of the notification.

Based on these findings, the trial court acquitted Ms. Tuli of the charge. The complainant, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, filed an application seeking leave to file an appeal against the acquittal. The court found no grounds to grant the relief and dismissed the application.

The case highlights the importance of clear and specific notifications. The notification in question did not specify the water body to which it applied, which created ambiguity and made it difficult for the prosecution to prove its case.

The prosecution in this case failed to produce any evidence to show that the water body in question was covered by the notification or that the construction was made after the issuance of the notification.

In conclusion, the case of Haryana State Pollution Control Board v. Ms. Sobha Tuli is an example of how clear and specific notifications are important in enforcing environmental regulations. It also highlights the importance of producing evidence to support allegations made in a complaint.
