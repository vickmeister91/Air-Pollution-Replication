The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a member of the Indian Forest Service who was transferred and posted to Ropar as Divisional Forest Officer. During the period of posting, the petitioner found that Col. B.S. Sandhu had committed certain forest offences, for which the petitioner got six criminal complaints registered against him in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ropar. The court directed the registration of First Information Report as contained in directions (viii) and (ix).

In another case, the court order states that the entire land of village Karoran, Tehsil Kharar, District Ropar is forest land and has been utilized for non-forest purposes, including establishing a Forest Hill Resort. The CBI was directed to constitute a SIT to determine the accountability of officers and administrative functionaries of the departments concerned. The petitioner, an IFS officer, was named in the FIR and prosecution requires sanction from the government. The State Government sought the advice of the Advocate General, who opined that no prima facie case is made out against the petitioner. The State Government declined the request of the CBI for grant of sanction for prosecution of the petitioner.

The court also discusses a case where the Central Vigilance Officer in the Ministry of Environment and Forest disagreed with the recommendations and investigation report of the CBI regarding the petitioner for giving sanction of prosecution. The Government of India also disagreed with the report of the CBI and concluded that there was no case for prosecution against the petitioner. However, the Central Vigilance Commission passed an order recommending prosecution against the petitioner, which the Government of India granted. The petitioner argues that the order was cryptic and non-speaking, and that the circular issued by the CVC limits the scope of reconsideration. The court discusses the jurisdictional issues and the unreasonable delay in the matter.

The court rejected the conversion of forest land for non-forest purposes and directed the state government to take action against officials responsible for violations. The petitioner, a public servant, did not take action to prevent destruction of forest land and forwarded proposals for conversion of forest land, concealing the fact that damage reports had been filed against the person submitting the proposals. The government of India found no case for prosecution of the petitioner but the CVC recommended prosecution on the basis of a generalized plea of conspiracy. The government of Punjab requested the government of India to rescind the sanction order for prosecution.

The court order discusses the Government of Punjab's request to rescind a sanction order under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Government of India re-examined the matter and recommended withdrawing the prosecution sanction against the petitioner. However, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) refused to withdraw the sanction, citing its circular that there is no law to withdraw sanction for prosecution once granted. The court also discusses the CBI report and the Ministry's conclusion that a regular departmental inquiry for minor penalty be initiated against the petitioner. The Minister-in-charge approved the draft prosecution sanction order against the petitioner. The petitioner has filed a petition challenging the sanction order.

The court heard arguments from various parties, including the petitioner's counsel and representatives from the Central Government and Punjab. The petitioner argued that the final decision on their case rested with the Central Government, not the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), which is only a recommendatory body. The court agreed that the CVC has no overriding power over the Central Government and that decisions made by either party are subject to judicial review. The court also examined the constitutional validity of an office memorandum issued by the CVC in 2008, which prohibited the reconsideration of its advice even if new and material facts emerged. The court found that this memorandum needed to be tested and judged for its validity.

The court order declares that the instructions contained in OM dated 24.4.2008 are arbitrary, unconstitutional, and ultra vires the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003. The order is quashed, and the Central Government is directed to re-consider the matter afresh by itself as the disciplinary authority with respect to grant or refusal to grant sanction of prosecution of the petitioner by ignoring the impugned OM dated 24.4.2008. The interim mandamus dated 19.1.2011 issued by this Court will continue to operate until the final decision is taken on re-consideration of the entire matter. The writ petition stands allowed with costs of Rs.20,000/- against respondent No.2.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various cases involving forest offences and violations of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The court has directed the state government to take action against officials responsible for violations and has quashed certain instructions issued by the Central Vigilance Commission. The court has also emphasized the importance of access to reason in administrative action and the need for decisions made by either party to be subject to judicial review.
