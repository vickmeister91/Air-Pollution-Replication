The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently disposed of a petition that challenged an order passed by the Regional Officer (Pollution). The court directed the petitioner to avail the alternative remedy of filing an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 within fifteen days.

The case in question pertained to a dispute between the petitioner and the Regional Officer (Pollution) regarding the latter's order to shut down the petitioner's factory due to non-compliance with pollution control norms. The petitioner had challenged this order in court, arguing that it was arbitrary and unjustified.

However, the High Court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court. Specifically, the court pointed out that the petitioner had not filed an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which provides for an appellate mechanism for challenging orders passed by pollution control authorities.

The court emphasized that the availability of an alternative remedy is a well-established principle of law, and that courts should not entertain petitions that seek to bypass such remedies. The court also noted that the petitioner had not shown any exceptional circumstances that would justify the court's intervention in this case.

In light of these observations, the court disposed of the petition and directed the petitioner to avail the alternative remedy of filing an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 within fifteen days. The court also clarified that the disposal of the petition would not prejudice the petitioner's right to file an appeal.

This decision by the Madhya Pradesh High Court underscores the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the courts. It also highlights the need for strict compliance with pollution control norms, and the role of pollution control authorities in enforcing these norms.
