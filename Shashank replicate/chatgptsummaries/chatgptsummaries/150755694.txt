In a recent court order, the case between Raju @ Purshottam and the State of Madhya Pradesh was discussed. The applicants had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. However, during the hearing, their counsel requested to withdraw the petition. As a result, the petition was dismissed, but the applicants were given the liberty to file a fresh application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.C.C. if they obtain copies of witness statements filed before the trial court under the Right to Information Act.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the applicants had filed a petition under this section, but later decided to withdraw it. The court allowed them to do so, but also gave them the option to file a fresh application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.C.C.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.C.C. deals with the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. It allows the court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that it considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding.

In this case, the applicants were given the liberty to file a fresh application under this section if they obtain copies of witness statements filed before the trial court under the Right to Information Act. The Right to Information Act allows citizens to access information held by public authorities in order to promote transparency and accountability in government.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and the availability of options for applicants to pursue their case. While the applicants withdrew their initial petition, they were given the opportunity to file a fresh application if they obtain the necessary documents. This emphasizes the importance of access to information and the role it plays in legal proceedings.
