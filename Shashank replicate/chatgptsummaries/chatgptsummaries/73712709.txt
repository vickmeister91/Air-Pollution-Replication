The court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s Ashoka Stone Crushing Company seeking the quashing of an FIR registered against them for violating an order promulgated by a public servant. The FIR was registered after the company was found to have resumed crushing activities despite a court order directing the closure of their operations. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Appellate Authority had stayed the operation of the order and allowed the unit to run. The court has not yet made a decision on the petition.

In another petition filed by a stone crusher company against an FIR registered against them for violating an order to stop operations, the company argued that they had permission from a competent authority to run the crusher and that there was no violation of any environmental or forest act. The court found that the FIR was not maintainable as it was filed in the wrong forum and that the company was not in disobedience of any order. The court also examined whether the company was in violation of Section 188 of the IPC or the Haryana Regulation of Crushers Act, 1991, and found that they were not.

The court order allowed the petitioner to appeal against an order from the Director, Mines & Geology, and the Appellate Authority allowed the petitioner to run their unit. The order of the Appellate Authority was stayed, so there was no violation of it. The petition was allowed, and the FIR registered against the petitioner was quashed. However, the petitioner must comply with all statutory requirements for running their unit in the future.

The court order pertains to two petitions filed by stone crusher companies against FIRs registered against them for violating orders to stop operations. In the first petition, M/s Ashoka Stone Crushing Company sought the quashing of an FIR registered against them for violating an order promulgated by a public servant. The company had resumed crushing activities despite a court order directing the closure of their operations. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Appellate Authority had stayed the operation of the order and allowed the unit to run. The court has not yet made a decision on the petition.

In the second petition, the stone crusher company argued that they had permission from a competent authority to run the crusher and that there was no violation of any environmental or forest act. The court found that the FIR was not maintainable as it was filed in the wrong forum and that the company was not in disobedience of any order. The court also examined whether the company was in violation of Section 188 of the IPC or the Haryana Regulation of Crushers Act, 1991, and found that they were not.

The court order allowed the petitioner in the second petition to appeal against an order from the Director, Mines & Geology, and the Appellate Authority allowed the petitioner to run their unit. The order of the Appellate Authority was stayed, so there was no violation of it. The petition was allowed, and the FIR registered against the petitioner was quashed. However, the petitioner must comply with all statutory requirements for running their unit in the future.

In both petitions, the stone crusher companies argued that they had permission to run their units and were not in violation of any orders. The court found that the FIRs were not maintainable and quashed them. However, the court also emphasized the importance of complying with all statutory requirements for running such units in the future. It remains to be seen what decision the court will make in the first petition filed by M/s Ashoka Stone Crushing Company.
