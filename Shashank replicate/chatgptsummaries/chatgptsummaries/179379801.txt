The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Tata Housing Development Company's proposed housing project, "CAMELOT," in the revenue estate of village-Kansal, Tehsil-Kharar, District-Mohali, State of Punjab, is invalid due to its location within the catchment area of Sukhna Lake and 123 meters away from the boundary of Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The Survey Map of India dated 21.09.2004, demarcating the area of Sukhna Lake, is binding on the State of Punjab. The environment clearance granted by State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) for development of the project is not in conformity with the Notification dated 14.09.2006 of Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and has been set aside. The court has ordered that if the permission is granted by the State of Punjab in favor of the appellant if it so desires, it may apply to Central Government for environmental clearance treating project category 'A.'

The High Court has set aside the permission granted to Tata Housing Development Company Limited (Tata HDCL) by the Nagar Panchayat to construct a housing project near Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The court found that the project site is a part of the area of Sukhna Lake and is situated within 123 meters from the sanctuary. The court also noted that no notification has been issued by the Central Government under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, declaring an eco-sensitive zone around the sanctuary. The court relied on a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, which prohibits new commercial construction within 0.5 km of the boundary of the protected area or up to the boundary of the eco-sensitive zone.

The court order requires the Ministry of Environment and Forests to file an affidavit stating whether proposals received for identifying suitable areas for conservation have been referred to the National Board for Wildlife. The order also directs states and union territories to respond to the Ministry's letter within four weeks and warns that failure to do so may result in the implementation of a decision to notify areas within 10 km of the boundaries of national parks and sanctuaries as eco-sensitive areas. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife and cites constitutional and statutory duties to do so. The Doctrine of Public Trust is also mentioned as a legal theory that holds certain common properties in trust for the free and unimpeded use of the general public.

The court order discusses the Public Trust Doctrine, which states that certain resources like air, sea, waters, and forests are so important to the public that they should not be subject to private ownership or commercial use. The doctrine imposes restrictions on governmental authority to protect these resources for the enjoyment of the general public. The court also considers the concept of sustainable development, which balances economic growth with environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. The court has enforced the polluter pays principle, which holds the polluter responsible for the damage caused to the environment. The court has also awarded damages to victims who have suffered due to environmental disturbance.

The court order states that a construction project cannot be allowed to come up within a short distance from the wildlife sanctuary due to the potential harm it could cause to the environment and ecosystem. The court cites the importance of protecting the ecological balance and the need for effective enforcement of environmental protection laws. The State of Punjab is criticized for not acting in the interest of the public trust and for allowing high-rise buildings in an area that is not permissible. The court quashes the clearance for the project and dismisses the appeals.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article relate to the proposed housing project by Tata Housing Development Company near Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The courts have ruled that the project is invalid due to its location within the catchment area of Sukhna Lake and 123 meters away from the boundary of Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary.

The courts have criticized the State of Punjab for not acting in the interest of the public trust and for allowing high-rise buildings in an area that is not permissible.
