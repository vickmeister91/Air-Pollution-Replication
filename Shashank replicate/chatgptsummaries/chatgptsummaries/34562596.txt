In a recent court order, a criminal revision petition filed by B K Mangalgi against the State by Harapanahalli Police was dismissed by the court. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Harapanahalli. However, the court found that the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. 

Section 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the powers of the High Court or Sessions Judge to call for and examine the records of any proceeding before any inferior criminal court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality, or propriety of any finding, sentence, or order. The section also empowers the High Court or Sessions Judge to make any order that it thinks fit, including an order for the transfer of the case to itself or any other subordinate court.

In the present case, the court found that the revision petition filed by the petitioner was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. This means that the court did not have the power to call for and examine the records of the proceeding before the inferior criminal court. The court also did not have the power to make any order in the matter.

The petitioner's counsel had requested the return of certified copies, which was granted by the court. Certified copies are copies of documents that have been certified as true copies by a public officer or notary public. In this case, the petitioner's counsel had likely requested the return of certified copies of the order passed by the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Harapanahalli.

It is not clear from the available information what the order passed by the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Harapanahalli pertained to. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner was not satisfied with the order and had filed a revision petition seeking to set it aside.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Cr.P.C. before filing any legal proceedings. It is also important to have a clear understanding of the grounds on which a revision petition can be filed and the powers of the court in such matters. In this case, the court found that the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C., which led to its dismissal.
