The Gujarat High Court recently heard several Public Interest Litigations (PILs) related to land allocation for the construction of a substation. The first PIL was filed by Ishwarbhai Nathubhai Naik under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by Respondent No.3 and quash the circular at annex. A & B and also quash the order giving the possession of said piece of 3400 sq. meters of land of Block No.405 to the Respondent no.5 as per Annexure-D to the petition. The petitioner argued that the order passed by Respondent No.2 declaring the land as the government padtar land or gauchar land is manifestly illegal, invalid and ab initio void. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a CAV judgment.

The court order discusses arguments made by both the petitioner and the respondents in a case regarding the allocation of land for a substation. The petitioner argues that the order of the respondents is illegal and violates guidelines for protecting water bodies. The respondents argue that the land in question is not a water body and that the petitioner is motivated by personal interests. The court also cites a general principle on locus standi, stating that public interest litigation should not be used for personal gain or political motives.

The court emphasized that public interest litigation should only be initiated by those who have a genuine interest in the matter and not for personal gain or political motives. The court must ensure that the applicant has clean hands, a clean heart, and a clean objective. The court must also be satisfied with the credentials of the applicant and the seriousness of the information provided. The court must strike a balance between avoiding reckless allegations and avoiding mischievous petitions seeking to attack justifiable executive actions. The court must be careful not to allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations.

The court order also emphasizes that courts must be careful not to encroach upon the sphere reserved for the executive and legislature while dealing with public interest litigations. The court must act ruthlessly against imposters and meddlesome interlopers who masquerade as crusaders of justice. Litigants do not have an unlimited right to court time and public money. The court must ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or political motivation. The court must maintain social balance by interfering where necessary for the sake of justice and refuse to interfere where it is against the social interest and public good. The court scrutinizes the petitioner's locus standi and examines whether the petition is motivated by personal interest or public interest.

The court order pertains to a dispute over land allotted to GETCO for the construction of a sub-station. The petitioner, who is a treasurer of the Temple Trust, had filed a PIL claiming that the land was a water body and should not be used for any other purpose. However, the court found that there was no evidence to support the petitioner's claim and that the land was allotted for public benefit. The court also cited various affidavits and documentary evidence to support its conclusion. The order also discusses the petitioner's reliance on certain judgments, but finds them to be irrelevant to the present case.

In another PIL, the court dismissed a case related to disputed land that had been allotted for the installation of a substation. The court cited various judgments that were not applicable to the case, including those related to the preservation of water bodies, eviction of illegal occupants, and pollution. The court also rejected the petitioner's request for an extension of interim relief.

Overall, the court emphasized the importance of genuine public interest in PILs and the need to avoid personal gain or political motives. The court also stressed the importance of evidence and relevant legal precedents in deciding such cases.
