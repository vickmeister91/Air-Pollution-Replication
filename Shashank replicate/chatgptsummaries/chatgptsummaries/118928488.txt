The court order in question relates to a revision petition filed by Babu Lal against an order that allowed the respondent, Mukesh Kumar, to defend himself in an eviction petition filed by Lal. The eviction petition was filed by Lal seeking possession of a tenanted premise for the bonafide requirement of his daughter-in-law. Kumar contested the petition, stating that Lal had other suitable accommodation available to him. The court granted leave to defend to Kumar, stating that he had raised triable issues and that the matter required further adjudication. Lal's revision petition was dismissed.

The case at hand involves a dispute between a landlord and a tenant over possession of a tenanted premise. Babu Lal, the landlord, had filed an eviction petition seeking possession of the premise for the bonafide requirement of his daughter-in-law. Mukesh Kumar, the tenant, contested the petition, stating that Lal had other suitable accommodation available to him. The court granted leave to defend to Kumar, stating that he had raised triable issues and that the matter required further adjudication.

The court's decision to grant leave to defend to Kumar was based on the fact that he had raised triable issues. These issues related to Lal's claim that the tenanted premise was required for the bonafide requirement of his daughter-in-law. Kumar had argued that Lal had other suitable accommodation available to him and that the tenanted premise was not required for the bonafide requirement of his daughter-in-law. The court found that these issues required further adjudication and therefore granted leave to defend to Kumar.

Lal had filed a revision petition against the court's order granting leave to defend to Kumar. However, the revision petition was dismissed by the court. The court found that there was no error in its decision to grant leave to defend to Kumar and that the matter required further adjudication. Lal's revision petition was therefore dismissed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of raising triable issues in eviction cases. If a tenant is able to raise triable issues, they may be granted leave to defend and the matter may require further adjudication. Landlords should therefore ensure that they have a strong case before filing an eviction petition, as tenants may be able to contest the petition if they are able to raise triable issues.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a revision petition filed by Babu Lal against an order that allowed the respondent, Mukesh Kumar, to defend himself in an eviction petition filed by Lal. The court granted leave to defend to Kumar, stating that he had raised triable issues and that the matter required further adjudication. Lal's revision petition was dismissed. The court's decision highlights the importance of raising triable issues in eviction cases and the need for landlords to have a strong case before filing an eviction petition.
