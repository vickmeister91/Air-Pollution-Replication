The court recently granted bail to Jagdish in a case related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution had alleged that 250 grams of raw meat of a boar was found in his house during a search. However, the court allowed the bail application on the basis of the charge-sheet and the fact that there was no material in the case diary as to the criminality of the applicant.

Jagdish was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs.30,000 and one surety of the same amount. Additionally, he was required to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section lays down the conditions for granting bail in non-bailable offences. The conditions include that the accused shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required, shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer, and shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to Jagdish was based on the fact that there was no material in the case diary to suggest that he had committed a criminal offence. The charge-sheet filed by the prosecution did not provide any evidence to support the allegation that Jagdish had possession of the boar meat. Therefore, the court found that there was no prima facie case against him.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, including boars, and provides for penalties for contravention of its provisions. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the prosecution had alleged that Jagdish had violated the provisions of the Act by possessing boar meat. However, the court found that there was no evidence to support this allegation. The court's decision to grant bail to Jagdish was based on the principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. In the absence of any evidence to suggest that Jagdish had committed a criminal offence, the court found that he was entitled to bail.

The conditions imposed by the court on Jagdish were aimed at ensuring that he did not abscond or interfere with the investigation. The requirement to furnish a personal bond and a surety was intended to ensure that he appeared in court when required. The conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. were aimed at preventing him from tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Jagdish in a case related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was based on the fact that there was no material in the case diary to suggest that he had committed a criminal offence. The court found that the charge-sheet filed by the prosecution did not provide any evidence to support the allegation that Jagdish had possession of the boar meat. The conditions imposed by the court were aimed at ensuring that he did not abscond or interfere with the investigation.
