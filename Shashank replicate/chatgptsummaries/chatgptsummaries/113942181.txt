The National Green Tribunal recently disposed of an appeal by Girdhars International Private Limited against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) order to close the unit and disconnect electricity and water supply. The Appellant's unit had been operating since 2005 and had obtained necessary consent from the DPCC, which was valid until June 2009. However, the DPCC refused to grant consent for extension of the permission in June 2011 and issued directions for closure of the unit and disconnection of electricity and water supply. The Appellant filed a representation before the DPCC, which was not considered, and the impugned order and directions were passed erroneously without giving any opportunity to the Appellant to show cause.

The National Green Tribunal, while disposing of the appeal, permitted the Appellant to apply afresh and seek permission to operate within two weeks. The DPCC shall consider the same and take a decision within three weeks from the date of receipt thereof. Till a final decision is taken by the DPCC on the said application, no coercive action would be taken against the unit.

The Tribunal's decision is a welcome relief for the Appellant, who had been facing the prospect of closure of their unit and disconnection of electricity and water supply.

The Tribunal's decision is also a reminder to the DPCC to follow due process and give an opportunity to the Appellant to show cause before passing any order or direction. The DPCC's refusal to grant consent for extension of the permission in June 2011 and issuance of directions for closure of the unit and disconnection of electricity and water supply without giving any opportunity to the Appellant to show cause was erroneous and against the principles of natural justice.

The National Green Tribunal's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that due process is followed and the principles of natural justice are upheld. It is important for regulatory bodies like the DPCC to follow due process and give an opportunity to the affected parties to show cause before passing any order or direction. This will not only ensure that the interests of the affected parties are protected but also enhance the credibility of the regulatory bodies.
