The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by R.K. Mahale against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner had filed an application seeking to be absolved from a statement made on his behalf through counsel on 29.01.2013. The statement in question related to the environmental clearance granted on 13.07.2010, before the construction work was completed. Environmentalists had raised complaints about the land being in the catchment of Upper Lake and that clearance should have been obtained before construction began.

The petitioner claimed that the statement was made without realizing the efficacy of the document supplied to him. However, the court rejected the petitioner's argument and stated that the statement was made consciously and cannot be retracted. The court also noted that the petitioner was aware of the proceedings arising from the environmental clearance granted on 13.07.2010.

The court found that the applicant should have taken due care before making the statement and that no indulgence needed to be shown for recall of the order. The amendment application was disposed of, and the writ petition would proceed for final hearing. The respondent's application for dismissal would proceed at the time of the final hearing.

The court's decision highlights the importance of due diligence and careful consideration before making statements in legal proceedings. The petitioner's attempt to retract a statement made on his behalf was rejected by the court, which found that the statement was made consciously and with full knowledge of the proceedings.

The court also noted that the petitioner was aware of the environmental clearance granted on 13.07.2010, and the complaints raised by environmentalists about the land being in the catchment of Upper Lake. This suggests that the petitioner should have been more careful in making the statement in question, given the potential implications of the environmental clearance and the ongoing legal proceedings.

Overall, the court's decision underscores the importance of careful consideration and due diligence in legal proceedings, particularly when making statements on behalf of others. It also highlights the need for individuals and organizations to be aware of the potential legal implications of their actions, particularly in relation to environmental issues and land use.
