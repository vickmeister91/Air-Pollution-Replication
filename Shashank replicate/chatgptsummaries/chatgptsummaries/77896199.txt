The court has granted anticipatory bail to Kaisar Ali, the owner of a crusher who is anticipating his arrest in connection with alleged offences under Sections 15/16 of the Environment (Protection) Act. The petitioner will be released on bail upon surrender or arrest, on the condition that he furnishes a bail bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the same amount each, subject to certain conditions.

The Environment (Protection) Act is a legislation enacted by the Indian government in 1986 with the objective of protecting and improving the quality of the environment. The act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution, and the protection of the environment and public health.

The alleged offences under Sections 15/16 of the act pertain to the violation of the provisions related to the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The act imposes strict liability on the person who handles such substances, and any violation of the provisions can result in imprisonment and/or a fine.

In this case, Kaisar Ali, the owner of a crusher, is apprehending his arrest in connection with the alleged offences. The court has granted him anticipatory bail, which means that he will not be arrested if he complies with the conditions set by the court.

The conditions of the bail include the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the same amount each. The sureties must be Indian citizens and must have immovable property within the jurisdiction of the court. The petitioner must also surrender his passport, if any, and not leave the country without the permission of the court.

In addition, the petitioner must cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings. He must not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner. He must also not commit any offence while on bail.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a discretionary power of the court, and it is granted in cases where the court is satisfied that the petitioner has a reasonable apprehension of arrest and that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that he has committed the offence. The court may impose conditions on the bail to ensure that the petitioner does not abscond or tamper with the evidence.

In this case, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Kaisar Ali after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has imposed conditions on the bail to ensure that the petitioner cooperates with the investigation and attends all court hearings.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a relief to the petitioner, as it allows him to avoid arrest and prepare his defence. However, the grant of bail does not mean that the petitioner is acquitted of the charges. The investigation and trial will continue, and the petitioner will have to prove his innocence in court.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Kaisar Ali, the owner of a crusher who is anticipating his arrest in connection with alleged offences under Sections 15/16 of the Environment (Protection) Act. The grant of bail is subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bail bond and the cooperation with the investigation. The grant of anticipatory bail is a relief to the petitioner, but the investigation and trial will continue, and he will have to prove his innocence in court.
