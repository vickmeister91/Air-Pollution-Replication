The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the issue of compassionate appointment under dying in harness rules for dependents of teaching and non-teaching employees of the Board. The purpose of compassionate employment is to provide a means of livelihood to the family of a deceased employee, but it cannot unduly interfere with the rights of other eligible candidates. The court notes that the appointment on compassionate grounds should be made at the lowest post in service and cannot be made on a promotional post.

In the first court order, the petitioner's father, who was a permanent Assistant Teacher in a Junior High School, died in harness leaving the petitioner unemployed and financially distressed. The petitioner applied for compassionate appointment under dying in harness rules on the post of Asstt. Teacher in Junior High School run by U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad but was appointed as Asstt. Teacher in Primary School instead. The petitioner claimed that he was eligible for being appointed as an untrained teacher in junior high school and that the State Government had issued several orders from time to time with regard to its policy for compassionate appointment under Dying-in-Harness Rules. However, the court examined the relevant provisions of Dying-in-Harness Rules and/or Govt. Orders having material bearing on the issue under which compassionate appointment under aforesaid rules are made vis-a-vis provisions of relevant service rules and concluded that the petitioner was not entitled for compassionate appointment on the post of Assistant Master in Primary School (Junior Basic School) or on the post of Assistant Master in Junior High School (Senior Basic School) which is a promotional post under relevant service rules in schools run and controlled by U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad under Dying-in-Haraess rules.

The second court order discusses the provisions for compassionate appointment under dying in harness rules for dependents of teaching and non-teaching employees of the Board. The order clarifies that eligible and qualified dependents can only be appointed on the post of Assistant Master or Assistant Mistresses in Primary School or on class III and IV posts of the Board, which are liable to be filled up by direct recruitment. The post of Assistant Master in Senior Basic Schools is a promotional post and can only be filled up by promotion of Assistant Teacher of Junior Basic School under Rule-18 of the Rules, 1981. The court also discusses the scope of Rule-10 for relaxation of rules of recruitment and the role of proviso appended to Rule 5(b) of the Rules 1981. The court cites several decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court to support its interpretation of the rules and provisions.

In the third court order, the court discusses the issue of compassionate employment and its limitations. The court notes that the appointment on compassionate grounds should be made at the lowest post in service and cannot be made on a promotional post. The court rejects the petitioner's claim for appointment as an Assistant Master in Senior Basic Schools, which is a promotional post, and upholds the decision of the District Basic Education Officer. The court also notes that the petitioner had already been appointed as an Assistant Teacher in Primary School on compassionate grounds and had no right to claim a higher post on the same grounds. The writ petition is dismissed.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of following the relevant rules and provisions when considering compassionate appointment under dying in harness rules. Eligible and qualified dependents can only be appointed on certain posts, and appointment on compassionate grounds should be made at the lowest post in service. The court also notes that compassionate appointment cannot unduly interfere with the rights of other eligible candidates.
