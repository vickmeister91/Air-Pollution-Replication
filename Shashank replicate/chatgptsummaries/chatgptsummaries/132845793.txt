The court order pertains to a petition filed against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal in O.A.No.140/2013. The National Green Tribunal had directed the deposit of 50% of the cost in the estimated plan for restoration of the environment. The State Government argued that the petitioner had not come with clean hands and that the writ petition had been filed in 2017 against an order passed in 2016. The court referred to an identical case and the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal in that case. The court also referred to the restoration plan prepared by the State Government and directed the mining lease holders and stone crushers to deposit an amount towards the restoration cost. The court imposed a fine on each mining lease holder.

The court order directs mining leaseholders and stone crusher owners to pay Rs. 5 lakhs per hectare for restoration plans in a phased manner. The first installment of Rs. 2 lakhs is to be deposited by 31.01.2017, with subsequent installments of Rs. 1 lakh each subject to the upper limit of Rs. 5 lakhs per leaseholder at the rate of Rs. 1 lakh per hectare by the last date of every calendar month. Notices will be issued for recovery of the amount, and in case of non-payment, recovery notices and orders for attachment of property will be issued. The State is responsible for carrying out the restoration plan in a phased manner. The writ petition filed by the petitioner is dismissed, and they are advised to approach the Supreme Court of India.
