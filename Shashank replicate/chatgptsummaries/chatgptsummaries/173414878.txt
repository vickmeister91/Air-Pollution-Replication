The court order pertains to a writ application filed by MGM Minerals Ltd. challenging the order/letter issued by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), Odisha, which granted the petitioner company "Environmental Clearance" for a period of 5 years for its mining project at village Patabeda. The petitioner argued that the SEIAA's decision was not in consonance with the provisions of Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, which grants Environmental Clearances in respect of mining projects for the "entire project life subject to a maximum period of 30 years."

The court heard arguments from both parties and ultimately upheld the SEIAA's decision, stating that the terms and conditions stipulated in the Environmental Clearance were rigorous and the SEIAA continued to possess control over the operation of the mine. The court found that the SEIAA's decision was not arbitrary and was in line with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006.

However, the court order also states that the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee did not comply with the direction issued by the Ministry of Environment Notification, 2006, which grants Environmental Clearances for mining projects for the project life or a maximum of 30 years. The court found that limiting the clearance to 5 years was arbitrary and not in line with the MOEF's direction.

The court ordered the Opposite Party No.1 (SEIAA) to grant an extension of Environmental Clearance to the petitioner-company for a period of 19 years from 1.4.2011 in terms of the approval of mining plan granted by the Indian Bureau of Mines dated 1.4.2011. The interim order allowed the mining operation to continue until the compliance orders were issued by the SEIAA within four weeks.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, and the Ministry of Environment Notification, 2006, with respect to the grant of Environmental Clearances for mining projects. The court's decision also highlights the importance of compliance with the directions issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee in granting Environmental Clearances.

The court's decision also has implications for the mining industry in India, as it clarifies the duration of Environmental Clearances for mining projects and emphasizes the need for compliance with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, and the Ministry of Environment Notification, 2006. The court's decision also underscores the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development in the mining industry.
