The Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court to challenge a communication from the Regional Chief Conservator of Forest (RCCF), which required the company to obtain prior permission from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, before carrying out any non-forest activity in forest areas covered by the Act. The company argued that since the land was acquired for mining purposes and vested in the Central Government, no prior permission was needed. However, the court held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applied irrespective of ownership over the land and that any non-forest activity within a forest area required prior approval from the Central Government. The court dismissed the writ petition and upheld the communication from the RCCF.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes like mining, industrial projects, and infrastructure development. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in forest areas covered by the Act. The Act defines forest land as any land recorded as forest in government records, whether or not it is actually forested. The Act also covers any area that is deemed to be forest under any state law, even if it is not recorded as forest in government records.

In the present case, the CCL had acquired land for mining purposes, which was recorded as forest in government records. The RCCF had issued a communication to the CCL, stating that any non-forest activity in the forest area would require prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The CCL challenged this communication, arguing that since the land was acquired for mining purposes and vested in the Central Government, no prior approval was needed.

The court examined the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and observed that the Act applied to all forest areas, irrespective of ownership over the land. The court noted that the Act was enacted to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes and to ensure that such diversion was done in a judicious and sustainable manner. The court held that the Act was a special law that overrode any other law that may be in force in relation to forest land. The court also observed that the Act was in line with the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests and wildlife.

The court further noted that the definition of forest land under the Act was wide and included any land recorded as forest in government records, whether or not it was actually forested. The court held that the land in question was recorded as forest in government records and was therefore covered by the Act. The court also observed that the Act required prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in forest areas covered by the Act. The court held that the communication from the RCCF was in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that the CCL was required to obtain prior approval from the Central Government before carrying out any non-forest activity in the forest area.

The court dismissed the writ petition filed by the CCL and upheld the communication from the RCCF. The court held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was a special law that applied to all forest areas, irrespective of ownership over the land. The court also observed that the Act was in line with the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests and wildlife. The court's decision reaffirmed the importance of protecting forests and wildlife and ensuring that any non-forest activity in forest areas was done in a sustainable and judicious manner.
