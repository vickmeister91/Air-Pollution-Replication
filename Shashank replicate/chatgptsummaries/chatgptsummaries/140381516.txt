On April 2, 2014, ACMM (Special Acts) Central Devendra Kumar Sharma at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi announced a court order in the case of WLI vs Rauf Ajaz Bhat. The case involved the possession of nine Shahtoosh shawls made of Tibetan Antelope (Chiru), a scheduled animal specified in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The shawls were seized by the Wildlife Enforcement Staff of Govt. of NCT Delhi near Jangpura & Lajpat Nagar-I Railway Crossing track/line on March 21, 2002. Bhat was convicted under section 49 of the Act for violating section 44/49 and 49B(1) by possessing the shawls. He had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, but was ultimately found guilty and convicted.

The court order prohibits certain activities related to scheduled animal articles and animals, but the prosecution failed to prove certain charges against Bhat. The defense counsel argued that Bhat was innocent and that there were material contradictions in the prosecution's case. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove certain charges against Bhat, but he was still charged with possession of articles derived from wild animals. The defense counsel also argued that the prosecution had not followed proper procedures and that there were material contradictions in the case. However, the court found these arguments to be of little help to Bhat.

The court order discusses the arguments made by the defense counsel and the prosecution in a case involving the possession of wild life articles without a license. The court notes that minor contradictions and discrepancies in witness testimony are normal and should not be given undue importance. The court also cites the presumption of unlawful custody in cases involving possession of captive animals or animal articles. Ultimately, Bhat is found guilty and convicted for the offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The judgment is to be sent to the court's website.

The court order was 14 pages long and provides a detailed account of the case. It highlights the importance of protecting scheduled animals and the consequences of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court also emphasizes the need for proper procedures to be followed in cases involving possession of wild life articles. While the defense counsel argued for Bhat's innocence, the court found him guilty based on the evidence presented. The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating wildlife protection laws.
