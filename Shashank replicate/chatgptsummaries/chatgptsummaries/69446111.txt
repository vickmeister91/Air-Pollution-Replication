The court allowed the review petition and ordered the matter to be reconsidered on merits, and the W.P.(C) was posted for 19 October 2017.

The writ petition in question had raised disputes regarding a notification issued under the Preservation of Trees and Forest Conservation Act. However, the court had not gone into the merits of these disputes and had disposed of the writ petition, giving liberty to the petitioners to challenge the notification.

The court's decision to allow the review petition and order the matter to be reconsidered on merits is significant as it provides the petitioners with an opportunity to have their grievances heard and addressed. It also highlights the importance of due process and the need for courts to carefully consider the merits of each case before making a decision.

The court's decision to allow the review petition and order the matter to be reconsidered on merits is likely to be welcomed by the petitioners and others who have been affected by the notification. It provides them with an opportunity to have their concerns heard and addressed, and to seek relief from the court if necessary.

Overall, the court order in question highlights the importance of due process and the need for courts to carefully consider the merits of each case before making a decision.
