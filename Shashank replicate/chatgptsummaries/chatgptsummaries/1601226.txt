The court system is an essential part of any democratic society, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring that justice is served. However, the court system can only function effectively if it is used properly and not abused for personal gain or political motives. In this context, the court has issued several orders that emphasize the importance of using the legal system for the public good and not for personal gain.

One such case involved a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed against the Bajaj Group. The petitioners claimed that the group had illegally purchased land and established a mill without obtaining necessary permissions, which would cause environmental pollution and harm to the villagers. However, the respondents provided evidence of obtaining necessary permissions, and the petitioners were unable to explain their conduct in filing the petition without disclosing relevant facts. The court rejected the petitioners' request to withdraw the case and emphasized that a person must have a legal right to challenge an act or order. The court also stated that PIL should not be used for personal gain or political motives.

The court order emphasizes that PIL should only be used to protect the basic human rights of weaker sections of society and to compel the executive to carry out its constitutional and legal obligations. The court warns against the misuse of PIL for personal gain or to serve private interests. The court also cautions that the judicial process should not become an instrument of oppression or abuse. The court notes that litigants must approach the court with clean hands and a clean mind, and that filing a totally misconceived petition amounts to an abuse of the process of the court. The court also warns that intentionally making false statements in court or in pleadings to mislead the court and obtain a favorable order amounts to criminal contempt.

The Supreme Court has also ruled that deliberately making false or misleading statements in a litigation with the intention of obtaining a favorable order amounts to contempt of court and interferes with the due course of judicial proceedings. The court has the duty to protect the public's interest in the administration of justice and has the power to punish contemnors to prevent abuse and mockery of the judicial process. Filing inaccurate documents deliberately to mislead the court also amounts to contempt of court. In one case, the court dismissed a petition and charged the petitioners with criminal contempt for filing a forged document and making false averments to mislead the court to obtain a favorable order. The petitioners were ordered to pay a cost of Rs. 1,00,000/- and file a reply to the charge within two weeks. The matter was listed before an appropriate bench on 05.01.2006, and the petitioners were directed to remain present before the court.

In conclusion, the court system is an essential part of any democratic society, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring that justice is served. However, it is important to use the legal system for the public good and not for personal gain or political motives. The court has issued several orders that emphasize the importance of using PIL to protect the basic human rights of weaker sections of society and to compel the executive to carry out its constitutional and legal obligations. The court has also warned against the misuse of PIL for personal gain or to serve private interests and cautioned that the judicial process should not become an instrument of oppression or abuse. Finally, the court has the power to punish contemnors to prevent abuse and mockery of the judicial process and has emphasized that filing inaccurate documents deliberately to mislead the court amounts to contempt of court.
