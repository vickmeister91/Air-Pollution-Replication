The court order in question pertains to the interpretation of Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 15 of the Indian Limitation Act. The central issue before the court is whether Section 48 is controlled by Section 15 or if it prescribes an absolute prohibition on fresh execution applications beyond twelve years from the date of the decree.

To arrive at a conclusion, the court examines the legislative history of Section 15 and the meaning of "prescribed" and "period of limitation." The court also considers whether the Civil Procedure Code is a special or local law under Section 29 of the Limitation Act. The court reviews previous cases and ultimately concludes that Section 48 is not controlled by Section 15 and that the period of 12 years mentioned in Section 48 is a period of limitation.

In another court order, the interpretation of the word "prescribed" in Section 15 of the Limitation Act and its application to Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code is discussed. The court examines various judicial opinions on the matter and traces the legislative history of the two acts. The court concludes that the rules laid down in the Limitation Act relating to the computation of periods of limitation can be applied to periods of limitation prescribed by other statutes of a general nature like the Civil Procedure Code. The court also finds that Section 48 of the Code does prescribe a period of limitation and is subject to the rules laid down in Section 15 of the Limitation Act.

The third court order discusses the history of the Limitation Act and the Civil Procedure Code in India. It notes that the Act of 1871 was more comprehensive than the Act of 1859, and that it repealed practically all portions of the Civil Procedure Code of 1859 which contained periods of limitation for specified applications. The court also discusses the provisions of the Act of 1908 and the corresponding provisions in the Civil Procedure Code. The court ultimately concludes that Section 48 of the Code is controlled by Section 15 (1) of the Indian Limitation Act.

In summary, the court orders revolve around the interpretation of Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 15 of the Indian Limitation Act. The court examines the legislative history of the two acts, the meaning of "prescribed" and "period of limitation," and whether the Civil Procedure Code is a special or local law under Section 29 of the Limitation Act. The court concludes that Section 48 is not controlled by Section 15 and that the period of 12 years mentioned in Section 48 is a period of limitation. The court also finds that the rules laid down in the Limitation Act relating to the computation of periods of limitation can be applied to periods of limitation prescribed by other statutes of a general nature like the Civil Procedure Code. Finally, the court concludes that Section 48 of the Code is controlled by Section 15 (1) of the Indian Limitation Act.
