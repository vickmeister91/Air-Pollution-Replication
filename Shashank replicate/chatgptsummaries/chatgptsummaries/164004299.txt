In a recent court order, the applicant Kamal Khan was convicted for the commission of an offense punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found no illegality or jurisdictional error in the conviction and maintained it.

The case pertains to a criminal revision case where Kamal Khan was convicted for the commission of an offense punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The offense under Section 51 of the Act pertains to the hunting of wild animals without a license or permit. The punishment for such an offense is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.

In this case, the court found that Kamal Khan had hunted a wild animal without a license or permit and had therefore committed an offense under Section 51 of the Act. The court found no illegality or jurisdictional error in the conviction and maintained it. However, the court allowed the applicant to be sentenced to the period already undergone by him. This means that Kamal Khan will not have to serve any additional time in prison for the offense he committed.

The court also imposed an additional fine of Rs. 5,000/- on Kamal Khan. This fine must be deposited within 30 days from the next date of his appearance before the trial court. Failure to deposit the fine within the stipulated time will result in the imposition of further penalties. The court discharged Kamal Khan's bail bonds, which means that he is no longer required to furnish any security for his release.

The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.

However, the court allowed the applicant to be sentenced to the period already undergone by him by imposing an additional fine of Rs. 5,000/-. The court discharged his bail bonds. The court's decision in this case sends a strong message to those who engage in illegal hunting and poaching activities and reinforces the need to protect the country's wildlife and natural resources.
