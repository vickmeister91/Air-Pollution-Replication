The court disposed of the petition without touching upon the merits of the matter and ordered that any pending miscellaneous petitions in this criminal petition shall stand closed.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had approached the High Court seeking to quash the proceedings against him under the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act.

The petitioner's counsel had requested the court to direct the police to follow the procedure under Section 41-A of the Cr.P.C. Section 41-A provides for a notice of appearance to be served on a person against whom a complaint has been made before the police officer. The person is required to appear before the police officer at a specified time and place. This provision was introduced to prevent the arrest of a person without giving him an opportunity to explain his case.

The court disposed of the petition without touching upon the merits of the matter. This means that the court did not examine the evidence or the legal arguments presented by the parties. Instead, the court simply ordered that the petition be disposed of without any further proceedings. The court also ordered that any pending miscellaneous petitions in this criminal petition shall stand closed. This means that any other petitions filed by the petitioner in this case will be closed and will not be considered by the court.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash proceedings against the petitioner for offences under various sections of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner's counsel had requested the court to direct the police to follow the procedure under Section 41-A of the Cr.P.C. The court disposed of the petition without touching upon the merits of the matter and ordered that any pending miscellaneous petitions in this criminal petition shall stand closed.
