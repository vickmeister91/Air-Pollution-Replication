This court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Smt. Ram Dulari against Smt. Ram Pyari for a property in Delhi. The petitioner claimed that she required the tenanted shop for her residence due to her old age ailments and lack of sufficient accommodation. The respondent filed an application for leave to defend, claiming that the petitioner already had sufficient space and that the respondent, being a poor widow, had a bonafide need for the shop.

The court heard both parties and determined that the application for leave to defend was filed within the period of limitation. The court order states that the period of limitation for filing an application for leave to defend is 15 days from the date of second service. The court must determine whether the tenant is entitled to leave to defend by disclosing material and substantial facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order. The landlord must satisfy the conditions of ownership, bonafide requirement, and non-availability of reasonably suitable accommodation.

In this case, the petitioner requires the tenanted shop for her residence due to old age ailments and insufficient accommodation. The respondent's allegations of the petitioner having other accommodation are not supported by evidence. The petitioner's need for a guest room, store room, and other amenities is justified. The respondent's claim of a coaching center on the first floor does not affect the petitioner's requirement for the tenanted shop.

The court order dismisses the respondent's application for leave to defend and grants eviction in favor of the petitioner. The court reiterates that the petitioner's requirement for the tenanted room cannot be brushed aside and that the landlady is the best judge of her requirements. The respondent's additional defense of being a poor widow lady and requiring the shop more than the petitioner is denied as it does not raise any triable issue.

The petitioner is directed to obtain possession of the tenanted shop after six months from the date of passing of the order. No costs are awarded, and the file is consigned to the record room.
