The Madras High Court recently heard four writ petitions related to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1943. The first two petitions challenged the fourth proviso added to Rule 105 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1943, which requires Diclofenac Injection for human use to be in single unit dose packs only. The petitioners argued that there was no study to show that 30ml bottles being multi-dose packs for human beings were being diverted for animal use. The court constituted a three-member expert committee to study the matter and support the introduction of the impugned provision. The court ultimately upheld the provision.

The third petition pertained to a case where 454 writ petitions were filed against 344 notifications dated 10.03.2016, made by the Central Government under Section 26A of Drugs Act. The court set aside the notifications as they were issued without following the statutory procedure and without taking advice from the statutory bodies created under the Drugs Act. The court also emphasized the importance of institutions and adherence to constitutional values. The court appointed a three-member committee to examine the technical aspects of the case. The court rejected the argument that the notifications were issued in the interest of public health and safety and cited the importance of following the prescribed procedure. The court also referred to the precautionary principle and the need for constant attention to ensure the quality and standard of drug preparations.

The fourth petition challenged the fourth proviso to Drug Rules, which regulates the quality and standard of drug preparations. The court upheld the provision, stating that the challenge to the provision does not fit into any of the six postulates laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.Krishnamurthy's case. The petitioners were given adequate opportunity by the Expert Committee to present their case, but they did not reply to specific queries. The court dismisses both writ petitions and leaves the parties to bear their respective costs.

The second petition discussed a provision that prohibits the use of Diclofenac injections in animals due to concerns about the decline in vulture populations. The order outlines arguments made by both sides, including the government's assertion that the provision was introduced in the public interest and after consultation with stakeholders. The court appointed a three-member expert committee to examine the issue and make recommendations. The committee found that the use of Diclofenac in animals was correlated with declining vulture populations and recommended continued prohibition of its use in animals. The court ultimately held that the writ petitions challenging the provision were maintainable and rejected the government's argument that there was a lack of territorial jurisdiction.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard four writ petitions related to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1943. The court upheld the fourth proviso added to Rule 105 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1943, which requires Diclofenac Injection for human use to be in single unit dose packs only.
