The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between Oswal Agro Mills Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The case involved the construction of a residential and commercial complex on land bearing CTS Nos. 381 and 381/1 to 22, Village Anik, Taluk Chembur, MSD, Mumbai. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court had allowed the writ petition filed by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and quashed the sanction accorded by the competent authority of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai for change of user and construction of the complex.

The Municipal Commissioner was directed to reconsider the application made by Oswal Agro Mills Ltd keeping in view the objections raised by the Police Department, Ministry of Petroleum, Ministry of Environment and Intelligence Bureau and the Security Control Regulations issued by the State of Maharashtra under Section 37 (1AA) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.

The court order discussed a case where a company purchased land near a refinery and obtained various approvals and permissions to construct buildings. The refinery company filed a writ petition to quash these approvals, citing security threats and environmental concerns. The court considered arguments from both sides and ultimately allowed the construction to proceed, noting that the refinery was already surrounded by dense human habitation and that other high-rise buildings were situated closer to the refinery than the proposed construction. The court also considered the delay in filing the writ petition and the fact that the construction was being done under a government project.

In another case, the court order discussed a dispute over the construction of residential buildings near a refinery owned by the petitioner. The respondent, who had been granted permission to construct the buildings, argued that the area had already been developed with multi-storey buildings and that the statutory authorities had taken steps to safeguard hazardous industries. The petitioner argued that the construction posed a security risk to the refinery and that the authorities did not pay due attention to this issue. The court ultimately quashed the permission granted for the construction and directed the Municipal Commissioner to reconsider the applications after considering the objections raised by various departments and the provisions of Security Control Regulations.

The court order stated that the Municipal Commissioner approved a change of user and building plan without considering various issues, including health, safety, fire safety, structural safety, and public safety. The court held that the Commissioner is prohibited from granting such relaxations if it affects public safety and health. The court also referred to a judgment that pointed out the security threat to vital installations, including the HPCL refinery, and held that the Commissioner should have considered the security aspect before granting permission for development or change of user. The court further observed that the Commissioner failed to take into consideration various aspects such as hazardous activity being carried out by the refinery and security threats. The court held that the Commissioner is required to take into consideration various aspects such as security threats, fire safety, health, etc. while considering such matters.

The court order required the Commissioner to consider the matter appropriately and not decide it mechanically. The court found that the concerned authority did not apply their mind while sanctioning the change of land use for the plot owned by the appellant. The court also found that the High Court did not consider the issues of security and possible adverse impact on the health of those who may occupy the buildings to be constructed by the appellant due to the existence of refineries and industries in the area in a correct perspective. The matter was remitted to the High Court for deciding the writ petition of respondent No.1 afresh after considering the material produced by the parties on the issues of security threat and possible danger to the health of the occupants of the buildings already constructed and those who may occupy the buildings to be constructed by the appellant.

The court order pertained to a dispute between the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and Oswal Realty Private Limited over the construction of a residential-cum-commercial complex near the HPCL refinery in Mumbai. The HPCL had objected to the construction, citing health hazards and security concerns. The court ultimately sided with the HPCL, setting aside all permissions granted to Oswal and directing the Municipal Commissioner and Ministry of Environment to reconsider the application after considering objections from all concerned parties. The court also noted that there were existing structures in the vicinity, including slums and high-rise buildings, but emphasized that HPCL could not be held responsible for them.

In another case, Oswal Agro Mills Ltd. wanted to construct high-rise buildings near a refinery owned by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL). The High Court had allowed the construction, but the Supreme Court overturned the decision, citing safety concerns and the obligation of the Municipal Corporation to consider objections raised by HPCL. The court also disapproved of the Municipal Corporation's decision to file an appeal against the High Court's order, as Oswal had given an indemnity bond to the Municipal Commissioner. The Supreme Court directed the Municipal Commissioner to reconsider the application made by Oswal after considering objections raised by HPCL and other authorities and to consider the issue of possible danger to the health of occupants of the buildings already constructed and those to be constructed by Oswal. The court dismissed both appeals and ordered the parties to bear their own costs.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed various disputes related to the construction of buildings near refineries owned by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL). The court emphasized the importance of considering objections raised by HPCL and other authorities and the need to take into consideration various
