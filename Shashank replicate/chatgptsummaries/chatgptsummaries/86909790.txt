The Supreme Court recently heard an appeal by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad against an order passed by the Division Bench of High Court of Punjab & Haryana on 21.12.2015. The case involves the levy of user charges on Modern School, Faridabad for the operation of a privately installed tubewell. The High Court had set aside the charges on the ground that the levy falls within the ambit of Section 88 of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, and therefore, in the absence of prior approval of the State Government, such levy is not sustainable.

The Supreme Court heard arguments from both parties and relevant provisions of the Act before making a decision. The court order states that all public drains, sewage disposal works, and related materials in the Municipal area are under the control of the Corporation. The Commissioner is responsible for maintaining and repairing all municipal drains and sewage disposal works. Owners and occupiers of private drains within the Municipal area must communicate with the Municipal drains for the discharge of foul water and surface water. The Corporation can claim additional charges for water supply to premises at rates fixed by the government.

The Corporation is justified in levying user charges for the discharge of waste water into the Municipal drains by the Schools. The order allows the appeals and dismisses the writ petitions. The court order clarifies the responsibilities of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the owners and occupiers of private drains within the Municipal area.

The court order emphasizes that all public drains, sewage disposal works, and related materials in the Municipal area are under the control of the Corporation. The Commissioner is responsible for maintaining and repairing all municipal drains and sewage disposal works. This means that the Corporation has the authority to regulate the use of these facilities and to levy charges for their use.

Owners and occupiers of private drains within the Municipal area must communicate with the Municipal drains for the discharge of foul water and surface water. This means that private drains cannot discharge waste water directly into the environment but must connect to the Municipal drains for proper disposal. The Corporation can claim additional charges for water supply to premises at rates fixed by the government. This means that the Corporation can charge for the supply of water to premises and that the rates for such charges are fixed by the government.

The court order also clarifies that the Corporation is justified in levying user charges for the discharge of waste water into the Municipal drains by the Schools. This means that the Corporation can charge schools for the use of the Municipal drains for the disposal of waste water. The order allows the appeals and dismisses the writ petitions, which means that the Corporation's authority to levy such charges is upheld.

In conclusion, the court order clarifies the responsibilities of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the owners and occupiers of private drains within the Municipal area. It emphasizes the Corporation's authority to regulate the use of public drains, sewage disposal works, and related materials and to levy charges for their use. It also upholds the Corporation's authority to levy user charges for the discharge of waste water into the Municipal drains by the Schools.
