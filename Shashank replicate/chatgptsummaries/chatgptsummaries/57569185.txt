The court order pertains to a challenge to the validity of a notification dated August 10, 2017, which amended the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000. The court found that many important questions arise which are required to be finally decided and issued a Rule, with the concerned Respondents waiving service. The court also allowed an application for intervention in the case and directed the petitioners to carry out an amendment within a week. The order provides an overview of the relevant provisions of the unamended Principal Rules and the Schedule.

The court order imposes restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and public address systems, as well as sound-producing instruments and musical instruments, particularly at night time. The noise level at the boundary of public places where these instruments are used should not exceed 10 dB (A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB (A), whichever is lower. The order also prohibits the use of horns, sound-emitting construction equipment, and bursting of firecrackers in silence zones or during night time. Violators will be liable for penalties under the provisions of the Act. Complaints can be made to the authority if the noise level exceeds the ambient noise standards by 10 dB (A) or more. The authority has the power to issue directions to prevent, prohibit, control, or regulate the incidence or continuance of any vocal or instrumental music, sounds caused by playing, beating, clashing, blowing, or use of any instrument, or sound caused by bursting of sound-emitting firecrackers. The ambient air quality standards in respect of noise are also specified in the schedule.

The court order outlines noise pollution regulations for different areas, including industrial, commercial, residential, and silence zones. The order also explains the dB(A) Leq measurement system and defines day and night time. The order includes a notification from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change regarding the amendment of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. The amendment allows for the use of loudspeakers or public address systems during limited cultural, religious, or festive occasions, subject to certain conditions. The State Government may also permit such use during night hours for a limited duration not exceeding fifteen days in a calendar year. The order also includes the schedule to the principal rules and a footnote.

The court order discusses the impugned Rules enacted by the Central and State Governments, which were amended in 2011. The Rules were enacted to take away the basis of a previous court judgment in PIL No.173 of 2010 and other connected petitions. The court notes that the previous judgment has attained finality and outlines relevant clauses from the judgment. The court also refers to an interim order from 2003 that prohibited the grant of permission to use loudspeakers in silence zones as defined and discussed in the Principal Rules. The State Government applied for a review of the order, but the court upheld the original decision. The court also notes that the Apex Court virtually approved the view taken by the interim order in a later decision.

The court order upholds a previous decision to prohibit the use of loudspeakers in silence zones, as defined in the Principal Rules, even though the State Government had not declared any areas as silence zones. The Principal Rules were enacted to regulate noise pollution, which is considered a form of air pollution. The court cites Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life with human dignity, and holds that noise pollution is a real and present danger to people's health. The court emphasizes that the right to free speech is not absolute and cannot be used to violate the right of others to a peaceful, comfortable, and pollution-free life.

The court order discusses the effects of noise pollution on human health and the right to live in a pollution-free environment guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court cites a previous decision that anyone who wishes to live in peace and quiet within their home has a right to prevent noise pollution from reaching them. The court also recognizes noise as a pollutant and a major health hazard. The order addresses the argument that recent amendments to the rules have taken away the basis of a previous court decision and violated fundamental rights under Article 21 and Article 14 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses a challenge to the classification of silence zones in India and the violation of citizens' rights under the Constitution. The court considers arguments related to Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution and the violation of the 1986 Act and Rules. The court also discusses the lack of an express order dispensing with the requirement of prior notice under Rule 5 of the 1986 Rules. The court considers various legal precedents and the presumption of constitutional validity of legislation. The court does not grant an order of stay and suggests that specific allegations must be made in the petition to challenge the violation of fundamental rights.

The court order discusses the issue of granting an interim relief in a case challenging the constitutionality of a legislation. The learned Additional Solicitor General of India argued that the court should be extremely reluctant to pass an interim order in such cases. The court considered this argument and referred to previous judgments, stating that the court can only grant an interim order if the legislation is ex facie unconstitutional and if the factors of balance of convenience, irreparable injury, and public interest are in favor of passing an interim order. The court also discussed the issue of silence
