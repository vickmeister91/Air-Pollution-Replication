The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of respondents accused of violating the Water (Prevention and Control) of Pollution Act, 1974. The appellant argued that the trial court did not consider the evidence of witnesses and the Board. However, the High Court cited previous decisions and principles that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. The High Court found that the trial court was justified in acquitting the respondents as the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court order states that the prosecution has not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and the trial court was justified in acquitting the respondents of the charges against them. The findings recorded by the trial court are just and proper, and there is no reason to interfere with the order of acquittal. The appeal by the appellant board is dismissed, and bail bonds, if any, stand cancelled.

The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control water pollution.
