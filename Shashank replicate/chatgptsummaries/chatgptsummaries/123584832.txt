The writ petition filed by Shri Ram raises concerns about mining operations in violation of the Environment Protection Act 1986 and its rules. The petitioner sought to restrain the State of Haryana and others from carrying out such operations. However, the court notes that a similar issue was raised in a previous writ petition, which was disposed of on 6.9.2012. The court finds that the petitioner has failed to show that the current dispute is not covered by the previous order. As a result, the court disposes of the current writ petition in terms of the previous order.

The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition in terms of the previous order raises questions about the effectiveness of legal remedies in cases of environmental violations. The Environment Protection Act 1986 and its rules are designed to protect the environment and prevent harm to human health. However, if the court is unable to provide effective remedies for violations of these laws, it undermines their purpose and undermines public trust in the legal system.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that legal remedies are accessible and effective for all members of society. If individuals are unable to access legal remedies or if those remedies are ineffective, it can lead to a sense of injustice and a lack of faith in the legal system. This can have broader implications for social cohesion and the rule of law.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri Ram against the State of Haryana and others, seeking to restrain them from carrying out mining operations in violation of the Environment Protection Act 1986 and its rules. The court disposes of the writ petition in terms of a previous order, as the petitioner failed to show that the current dispute is not covered by the previous order. This decision raises questions about the effectiveness of legal remedies in cases of environmental violations and highlights the importance of ensuring that legal remedies are accessible and effective for all members of society.
