The petitioners argued that they cannot be compelled to produce it again. The court agreed with their argument and disposed of the petition. The court stated that if the document is needed for trial, the magistrate can call for it from the other court.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a magistrate to issue an order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is intended to enable the court to obtain evidence that is necessary for the just decision of a case. However, the section does not give the court unlimited power to compel the production of any document or thing. The court must exercise its power under the section in a reasonable and just manner.
