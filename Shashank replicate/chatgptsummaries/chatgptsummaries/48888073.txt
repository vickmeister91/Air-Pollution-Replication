The court order in question pertains to two bail applications filed by Imrat Singh and Udal Singh under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in a case registered against them and other co-accused persons for offences punishable under Sections 2, 9, 39, 44, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that Udal Singh was found in possession of five tiger's whiskers and one leopard's skull, while Imrat Singh was found in possession of a tiger's paw, all of which were being kept illegally.

The applicants' counsel argued that this was the first criminal case registered against them under the Act, and that they were daily-wagers whose families were dependent on their earnings. The court allowed the bail applications, ordering the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one solvent surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned for securing their presence on all such dates as may be fixed by it in the course of trial of the case.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants, and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

The possession of wild animals and their parts is strictly prohibited under the Act, and any person found in possession of such items can be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. The Act also provides for the forfeiture of any property used for committing an offence under the Act.

In the present case, the prosecution alleged that Udal Singh was found in possession of five tiger's whiskers and one leopard's skull, while Imrat Singh was found in possession of a tiger's paw, all of which were being kept illegally. The possession of these items is a serious offence under the Act, and can attract severe punishment.

However, the applicants' counsel argued that this was the first criminal case registered against them under the Act, and that they were daily-wagers whose families were dependent on their earnings. The court took note of these arguments and allowed the bail applications, subject to certain conditions.

The court ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one solvent surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned for securing their presence on all such dates as may be fixed by it in the course of trial of the case. This is a standard condition that is imposed while granting bail in criminal cases.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person should not be deprived of his liberty without due process of law. The court has taken into account the fact that this is the first criminal case registered against the applicants under the Act, and that they are daily-wagers whose families are dependent on their earnings.

However, it is important to note that the possession of wild animals and their parts is a serious offence under the Act, and can attract severe punishment. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants, and any violation of its provisions can have serious consequences for the environment and the ecosystem.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Imrat Singh and Udal Singh in the present case is a balanced one, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has imposed certain conditions while granting bail, which are aimed at ensuring that the applicants cooperate with the trial court and do not abscond. It is important for all citizens to respect the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and to refrain from any activity that can harm the environment and the ecosystem.
