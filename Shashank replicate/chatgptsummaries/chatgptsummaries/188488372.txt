The court order pertains to a criminal revision petition against an order passed by a trial court in a case of cheating and misappropriation of funds. The petitioner, who was a saint, had alleged that the respondents had allured him to purchase a flat through them, but had failed to deliver on their promise. The petitioner had given them Rs. 2 lakh as part consideration for the flat, but later found out that the documents produced by the respondents were forged and fabricated. The trial court had discharged the respondents, but the revision petition was allowed by the court.

The petitioner had argued that the trial court had ignored the evidence of the loss of original documents and the circumstances of losing the same, and had failed to appreciate the oral testimony of the witnesses and secondary evidence in absence of the primary evidence. The court order states that the case can be proved with secondary evidence and a prima facie case has been made against the accused. The trial court failed to appreciate that the complainant did not need to go to the site as there was no document for allotment in their favor. The petitioner did not suspect any conspiracy against them due to their plain and simple nature.

The court heard arguments from both sides and found that the trial court did not appreciate evidence as per law. The court also found that the complainant had been consistent in their allegations and that the case could be decided on circumstantial evidence. The court also noted that the original documents were stolen from the complainant's house, making it impossible to produce them in court. The court found that the allegations of forgery and fraud could have been ascertained by calling a witness from GDA along with their records.

However, the court order also states that the complainant did not seek permission to prove secondary evidence, and that the court should have taken further steps to advise the complainant to do so. The court has the power to procure all relevant pieces of evidence to reach a just conclusion. Therefore, the order is set aside and the matter is remanded back to the trial court to give further opportunities to the complainant to lead secondary evidence and to summon relevant witnesses. The trial court must make a fresh appreciation of the evidence before reaching any particular decision.

The order regarding the discharge of the co-accused is set aside, and the trial court must seek a report from the police agency regarding steps taken to apprehend the accused. This court order highlights the importance of appreciating evidence as per law and the need for the court to take proactive steps to ensure that all relevant evidence is presented before it. It also emphasizes the importance of secondary evidence in cases where primary evidence is not available. The court has the power to procure all relevant pieces of evidence to reach a just conclusion, and it is the duty of the court to ensure that justice is served.
