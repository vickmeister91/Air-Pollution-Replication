The court order in question is a criminal revision petition against the dismissal of an application filed by the revisionist under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. The revisionist had filed a complaint alleging that the accused had prepared fake and forged documents to obtain an electricity meter in his name for a shop owned by the revisionist's mother. The court had dismissed the application, stating that the evidence was within the reach of the complainant and no field investigation was required.

The revisionist's counsel requested the court to set aside the impugned order and direct the police to register an FIR. The court noted that the provisions of Section 154 of the Code are mandatory and the concerned officer is duty-bound to register the case on the basis of such information disclosing a cognizable offence. The court further stated that the police can conduct a preliminary inquiry before registering an FIR in cases where anonymous complaints are received. However, if a cognizable offense is made out, the police are duty-bound to register an FIR and investigate the case.

The court also noted that it has the discretion to direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case, but this power should be exercised judiciously and on proper grounds. The court should not decline the request for registration of an FIR just because the evidence is within the reach of the complainant. The court order sets aside the previous decision and sends the case back to the court for reconsideration.
