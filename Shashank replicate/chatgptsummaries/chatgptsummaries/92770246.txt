In November 2013, a court in India made a decision to quash a complaint and summoning order under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint had been filed by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against a company and its directors for promoting and marketing a construction project without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. The petitioners had filed a petition to quash the complaint and summoning order, and the court heard arguments from both sides before making its decision.

The court order stated that a notification had been issued in 2006 making it compulsory to obtain Environment Clearance from the Central Government before starting any construction projects. The accused in this case, M/s Park Centra Cyber Park, had started construction without obtaining prior clearance and had violated the notification. The accused had been given notices and public advertisements about the violation but had not taken any action. As a result, the accused had been charged under Section 15 of The Environment Protection Act.

The court allowed the petition and stated that the criminal proceedings against the petitioner should not proceed as they were granted clearance after the complaint was filed. The court cited the case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal to support its decision. The court order provided guidelines for when a criminal proceeding can be quashed, including situations where the allegations do not constitute an offense, there is an express legal bar, or the proceeding is maliciously instituted. The court cautioned that this power should be used sparingly and not arbitrarily.

In the present case, the petitioner had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate before starting their construction project, but a complaint was filed against them for not obtaining it. The court found the continuation of the criminal proceedings to be an abuse of process of law and allowed the petition. The court has allowed the present petition and quashed Complaint No.27 of 2009 and all subsequent proceedings arising from it, including the summoning order dated 25.08.2009, under Section 15 of the Act.

The decision of the court highlights the importance of obtaining necessary environmental clearances before starting any construction projects. The notification issued in 2006 makes it compulsory for all construction projects to obtain Environment Clearance from the Central Government. The accused in this case had violated the notification and had been charged under Section 15 of The Environment Protection Act.

The court order also provides guidelines for when a criminal proceeding can be quashed. The power to quash a criminal proceeding should be used sparingly and not arbitrarily. The court found that the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioner was an abuse of process of law and allowed the petition.

In conclusion, the decision of the court to quash the complaint and summoning order under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 highlights the importance of obtaining necessary environmental clearances before starting any construction projects. The court order also provides guidelines for when a criminal proceeding can be quashed, cautioning that this power should be used sparingly and not arbitrarily. The decision of the court serves as a reminder to individuals and companies to comply with environmental regulations and obtain necessary clearances before starting any construction projects.
