The court order in question deals with a dispute over the amount of court fee payable upon a plaint presented for the institution of a suit under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act. The court held that such a suit is essentially a suit for a declaratory decree, in which no consequential relief is asked, and that the fee payable on the plaint is Rs. 10. The court also rejected the argument that the suit falls within the description given in Section 7 Sub-section IV Clause (c) of the Court Fees Act, which would have made the fee payable dependent upon the value of the suit.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the nature of the suit brought under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act. The court held that such a suit is essentially a suit for a declaratory decree, in which no consequential relief is asked. This means that the plaintiff is seeking a declaration from the court regarding their rights under the Bengal Tenancy Act, but is not seeking any specific relief or remedy. As such, the court held that the fee payable on the plaint is Rs. 10, which is the fee prescribed for suits for a declaratory decree under the Court Fees Act.

The court also rejected the argument put forward by the defendant that the suit falls within the description given in Section 7 Sub-section IV Clause (c) of the Court Fees Act. This clause provides that the fee payable on a plaint shall be dependent upon the value of the suit, where the suit is for a declaratory decree or an injunction. The defendant argued that the suit brought under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act falls within this description, and that the fee payable should therefore be dependent upon the value of the suit.

However, the court held that the suit brought under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act is not a suit for an injunction, and therefore does not fall within the description given in Section 7 Sub-section IV Clause (c) of the Court Fees Act. The court noted that the suit is not seeking any specific relief or remedy, and is therefore not a suit for an injunction. As such, the fee payable on the plaint is not dependent upon the value of the suit.

In light of these findings, the court remitted the case to the Court of first instance in order that the plaintiff may have an opportunity to pay the proper Court-fee upon the plaint. This means that the plaintiff will have the opportunity to pay the fee of Rs. 10 that the court has prescribed for suits for a declaratory decree under the Court Fees Act. Once the fee has been paid, the case will proceed in accordance with the usual procedures of the court.

Overall, the court order in question provides an important clarification regarding the court fee payable upon a plaint presented for the institution of a suit under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act. The court has held that such a suit is essentially a suit for a declaratory decree, in which no consequential relief is asked, and that the fee payable on the plaint is Rs. 10. This decision will have important implications for future cases brought under Section 108 of the Bengal Tenancy Act, and will help to ensure that the correct court fee is paid in such cases.
