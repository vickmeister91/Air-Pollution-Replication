The Calcutta High Court recently heard an appeal against a judgment and order passed by a lower court in a case involving the issuance of a certificate of enlistment under the West Bengal Municipal Act. The lower court had allowed the writ application filed by the petitioner, who had applied for the certificate but had not received it within the stipulated 30-day period. The High Court stayed the operation of the judgment subject to certain conditions, including giving the petitioner an opportunity of hearing. The petitioner was subsequently granted an opportunity of hearing, but the application was again rejected.

The High Court considered the scope of the provisions of Sections 118 and 119 of the West Bengal Municipal Act and held that a certificate of enlistment is not necessary to be obtained before a person starts their profession, trade, or calling. The court also held that the right to carry on business is a fundamental right and that the municipality could not have withheld the grant of the enlistment certificate.

The court order states that an applicant cannot be denied enlistment on the grounds of not being able to prove tenancy in the premises where they carried out their business. The grant of a certificate of enlistment does not decide any question of title, and the question of title is irrelevant. The power of rejection of an application is limited to cases where the application is not in order. The enquiry under Section 119 has a limited scope and cannot extend to the question of the right of the person to hold the premises under a valid title of tenancy. The Municipality can grant such certificate of enlistment without prejudice to its rights and contentions.

The court rejected the contention that the scope of enquiry under Section 119 cannot be said to be limited. The court also rejected the submission that in the instant case Section 386(1)(c) is attracted. The court dismissed the appeal subject to the observations made hereinbefore, but in the facts and circumstances of this case, there will be no order as to costs.

In summary, the Calcutta High Court held that a certificate of enlistment is not necessary to be obtained before a person starts their profession, trade, or calling.
