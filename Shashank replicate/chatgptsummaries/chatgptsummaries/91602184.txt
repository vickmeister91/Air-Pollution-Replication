The court heard multiple special appeals regarding the selection process for the post of Teacher Grade II in Rajasthan. The controversy was focused on the subjects of Social Science and Mathematics. The Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC) had initially declared a select list on March 6, 2012, but after receiving representations and forming an expert committee, they revised the select list on September 20, 2012. Some candidates who were initially selected were not included in the revised list and filed writ petitions. The court heard arguments regarding the destruction of OMR sheets and the validity of the revised select list. The court also examined disputed questions and the expert committee's opinions.

The court order pertains to a case involving the selection process for the post of Teacher Grade II in Rajasthan. The court directed the Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC) to suggest the name of an independent expert to evaluate disputed questions in the subjects of General Knowledge, Social Science, and Maths. The court also constituted a subject expert committee to evaluate disputed questions in different subjects. The court directed the petitioners to provide a fresh compilation of disputed questions to the RPSC. The court disposed of the writ petitions and directed the RPSC to publish a revised select list based on the recommendations of the subject expert committee. The court also directed that there should be no further litigation regarding the issue raised. However, some of the applicants whose names were deleted from the revised select list filed separate appeals, and the matter came before the Division Bench of the court.

The court order discusses a case where a revised select list was published after subject experts reviewed representations from candidates regarding certain questions in the exam. The court emphasizes that judicial review in such cases is limited to examining the decision-making process for illegality, arbitrariness, and mala fides. The court also cites previous judgments that establish principles for judicial review in academic matters, including the importance of deferring to the opinions of subject experts. The court ultimately finds that the Public Service Commission acted appropriately in revising the select list and that the individual applicants' rights were not violated. However, the court also notes that regulations regarding the weeding out of records should not be used to destroy records pending litigation without the permission of the court.

The court order states that a select list of candidates was published on September 20, 2012, and any discrepancies in the question framing or answer evaluation affected all candidates, not just the appellants. The court also notes that the Public Service Commission (P.S.C.) should conduct itself more professionally in the future to avoid unnecessary litigation and loss of faith in the P.S.C. The court allows one special appeal and dismisses another, directing the respondents to make appointments of Teacher Gr.II (Social Science & Maths) based on the select list published on September 20, 2012, within one month. No cost is awarded.
