The court order pertains to two separate disputes regarding the installation of fuel stations in Haryana, India. The first dispute involves M/s Daya Singh Kisan Sewa Kendra and the State of Haryana and others, regarding the issuance of a Letter of Intent to run a retail outlet for Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). The petitioner alleges that the outlet is located 244 meters away from its fuel station, though on the other side of the road, contrary to the guidelines issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. The respondents deny the allegations and argue that the petitioner does not have the locus standi to maintain the present petition.

The second dispute involves a petition filed against the installation of a fuel station by respondent no. 6 in favor of respondent no. 12, alleging violation of government guidelines. The court found that the guidelines were not being violated as the fuel station was being installed on the other side of the road. The court also noted that there was no business rivalry as the fuel station of the petitioner was on one side of the road and the fuel station of respondent no. 6 was being installed on the other side. The petition was dismissed as being without merit.

In the first dispute, the court heard arguments from both parties and examined the guidelines issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. The petitioner argued that the guidelines clearly state that no fuel station should be located within a radius of 300 meters from an existing fuel station. The petitioner further argued that the location of the HPCL outlet was in violation of this guideline as it was located only 244 meters away from its fuel station.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner did not have the locus standi to maintain the present petition as it was not directly affected by the installation of the HPCL outlet. The respondents further argued that the location of the HPCL outlet was not in violation of the guidelines as it was located on the other side of the road.

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court examined the guidelines issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court noted that the guidelines do indeed state that no fuel station should be located within a radius of 300 meters from an existing fuel station. However, the court also noted that the guidelines do not specify whether this distance should be measured in a straight line or along the road.

The court further noted that the location of the HPCL outlet was on the other side of the road from the petitioner's fuel station. The court observed that the guidelines do not specify whether the distance should be measured from the center of the road or from the edge of the road. The court concluded that the location of the HPCL outlet was not in violation of the guidelines as it was located on the other side of the road.

In the second dispute, the court heard arguments from the petitioner and the respondents. The petitioner alleged that the installation of the fuel station by respondent no. 6 in favor of respondent no. 12 was in violation of government guidelines. The petitioner argued that the fuel station was being installed within a radius of 300 meters from its own fuel station, in violation of the guidelines.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the fuel station was being installed on the other side of the road and was not in violation of the guidelines. The respondents further argued that there was no business rivalry between the petitioner and respondent no. 6 as their fuel stations were located on opposite sides of the road.

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court examined the guidelines issued by the government. The court noted that the guidelines do indeed state that no fuel station should be located within a radius of 300 meters from an existing fuel station. However, the court also noted that the guidelines do not specify whether this distance should be measured in a straight line or along the road.

The court further observed that the fuel station of the petitioner was located on one side of the road and the fuel station of respondent no. 6 was being installed on the other side. The court concluded that the installation of the fuel station by respondent no. 6 in favor of respondent no. 12 was not in violation of the guidelines as it was being installed on the other side of the road.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate disputes regarding the installation of fuel stations in Haryana, India. In both disputes, the court examined the guidelines issued by the government and concluded that the installation of the fuel stations was not in violation of the guidelines. The court dismissed the petitions as being without merit.
