The court order pertains to two separate cases filed in the State of Himachal Pradesh. In the first case, Hotel Asian Plaza had filed a petition against the State Pollution Control Board regarding a notice issued by the board. The court passed an order on July 6, 2017, directing the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanctioned plans and beyond compoundable limits. The matter was listed for compliance and further hearing.

In the second case, a petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws and compoundable limits. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that in case the amendment incorporated in the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act is struck down, the petitioner will demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanction plans and beyond compoundable limits. The court also ordered the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. The court permitted the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposed of the writ petition as having been withdrawn.
