The Ghaziabad Development Authority had demanded a mutation fee from the petitioner, which the petitioner sought to quash through a writ petition. The petitioner argued that the mutation fee could not be demanded as it had not been prescribed by rules. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the State Government had issued an order prescribing the mutation fee, and the Authority was entitled to levy and demand the fee.

The court, in its order, held that the demand for mutation fee was illegal and without authority of law. The court explained that the rate of mutation charges had to be prescribed by rules, and the order issued by the State Government did not have the force of law. Therefore, the Authority could not levy and demand the fee.

The court cited previous cases to support its decision. It explained that the authority cannot levy charges unless there is a specific statutory provision empowering them to do so. In this case, since there was no provision for the mutation fee in the rules framed under Section 55(1) of the Act, the demand for the fee was illegal.

The court ordered the respondents to mutate the name of the petitioner within one month. The writ petition was allowed with costs assessed at Rs. 2,500.

In summary, the court held that the demand for mutation fee by the Ghaziabad Development Authority was illegal and without authority of law. The court explained that the rate of mutation charges had to be prescribed by rules, and the order issued by the State Government did not have the force of law. Therefore, the Authority could not levy and demand the fee. The court ordered the respondents to mutate the name of the petitioner within one month and allowed the writ petition with costs assessed at Rs. 2,500.
