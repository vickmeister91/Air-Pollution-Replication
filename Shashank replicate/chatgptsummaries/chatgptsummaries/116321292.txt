In the first court order, the case between Kaushal Kishor and the State of Uttar Pradesh Govt. of U.P. Home Secretary was deemed of great importance and referred to the Constitution Bench under Article 145(3) of the Constitution. The Constitution Bench was tasked with considering four questions, including whether public figures should be allowed to comment on crimes and whether private individuals or corporations should conform to Article 21 of the Constitution.

Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees the right to life and personal liberty to every citizen.

This is a significant question as it pertains to the responsibility of private entities in upholding the rights of citizens.

This is an important question as public figures often have a significant influence on public opinion and their comments can impact the outcome of legal proceedings. The court's decision on this matter could have far-reaching implications for the freedom of speech and expression of public figures.

Overall, the court's decision to refer this case to the Constitution Bench highlights the importance of the questions at hand. The Constitution Bench will have to carefully consider the implications of their decision on the rights of citizens and the freedom of speech and expression of public figures.
