The Kerala High Court recently heard a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the government orders on River Bed Sand Mining permission. The petitioner claimed that the government failed to discharge its responsibility by not insisting on Environmental Clearance for River Sand Mining. The government pleader argued that the government has taken adequate precautionary measures to allow sand mining on the River Beds, in accordance with the Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001.

The court found that the State Government appears to be following the direction in Deepak Kumar (supra) and have regulated the River Bed Mining activities as per the statutory norms as also the Guideline issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court closed the case but granted liberty to the petitioner to highlight specific instances of violation of the statutory norms as also the Supreme Court's directions, in the conduct of River Sand Mining in the State of Kerala.

The court order also lists four exhibits submitted by the respondents, including true copies of orders and letters from various dates. These exhibits may have played a role in the court's decision to close the case, as they likely provided evidence of the government's compliance with regulations and guidelines.

Overall, the court's decision appears to be a balanced one, taking into account both the petitioner's concerns about environmental clearance and the government's efforts to regulate sand mining in accordance with the law. The court's decision to grant the petitioner liberty to highlight specific instances of violation suggests that the court is open to hearing further evidence of non-compliance with regulations and guidelines.

It is important to note that sand mining can have significant environmental impacts, including erosion, loss of habitat for aquatic species, and changes to water quality. As such, it is crucial that governments regulate sand mining activities to minimize these impacts and protect the environment.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. While sand mining can provide economic benefits, it must be done in a responsible and sustainable manner that takes into account the potential environmental impacts. The court's decision to grant the petitioner liberty to highlight specific instances of violation suggests that the court is committed to ensuring that sand mining activities in Kerala are conducted in accordance with the law and in a manner that protects the environment.
