The court order pertains to a dispute between the Marwari Sabha Pilakhwa, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, and Bhagwat Prasad, regarding the control of the administration of the Marwari Intermediate College run by the Marwari Sabha Pilakhwa. The plaintiffs had filed a revision under Section 115 of the C. P. Code against a revisional order passed by the Additional District Judge, Meerut, refusing the grant of a temporary injunction restraining the defendants opposite parties from interfering with the functioning of Bhagwat Prasad as the manager of the college pending their suit for a permanent injunction in the court of the Munsif Ghaziabad.

The court order discusses the legal jurisdiction of the Additional District Judge and the Civil Judge of Ghaziabad, and the merits of the case regarding who is in effective control of the administration of the college. The court noted that the Additional District Judge had no jurisdiction to pass the revisional order as the suit was pending before the Munsif Ghaziabad. The court also observed that the Civil Judge of Ghaziabad had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the college was situated in the jurisdiction of the Munsif Ghaziabad.

The court then proceeded to examine the merits of the case. The plaintiffs had contended that they were in effective control of the administration of the college and that the defendants were interfering with the functioning of Bhagwat Prasad as the manager of the college. The defendants, on the other hand, had claimed that they were in control of the college and that Bhagwat Prasad had been removed from his position as the manager.

The court noted that both parties had presented similar evidence, and even the principal of the college was unsure who was in control. The court observed that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case that they were in control of the college. The court also noted that the defendants had produced documents to show that they were in control of the college. The court, therefore, refused to grant an interim injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the functioning of Bhagwat Prasad as the manager of the college.

The court stated that it should be slow to pass interim orders in cases involving educational institutions and that the paramount interest should be that of the institution. The court observed that the college was an educational institution and that any interim order passed by the court would have an impact on the functioning of the institution. The court, therefore, held that the paramount interest in the case was that of the college and that the court should not pass any interim order that would affect the functioning of the institution.

The court further observed that the plaintiffs could seek a permanent injunction if they succeeded in establishing their rights in the suit. The court, therefore, dismissed the revision and made no order for costs.

In conclusion, the court order deals with a dispute over the control of the administration of a college. The court examined the legal jurisdiction of the Additional District Judge and the Civil Judge of Ghaziabad and the merits of the case regarding who was in effective control of the college. The court refused to grant an interim injunction and held that the paramount interest in the case was that of the college. The plaintiffs were given the option to seek a permanent injunction if they succeeded in establishing their rights in the suit. The court dismissed the revision and made no order for costs.
