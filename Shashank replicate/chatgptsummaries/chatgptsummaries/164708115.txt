The court order also pertains to a case where the applicants, who are directors of a company, were issued a process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. without any incriminating evidence against them. The court held that when a company is accused, its directors can only be held liable if there is sufficient incriminating evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or the statutory regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability. As there was no such evidence against the applicants, the order of issuing process against them was set aside. However, the court clarified that if sufficient incriminating material surfaces during the trial, the CJM can exercise his powers to rope in the applicants. The impugned order against the applicants was set aside with liberty.
