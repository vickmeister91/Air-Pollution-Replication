The Selur Mines challenged a letter sent by the Secretary to the Government, Environment and Forest Department to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Madras, which required all pending and future applications for mining leases on forest lands to be sent to the Industries Department through the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Director of Geology and Mining. The petitioner argued that non-forest activities could only be initiated and continued with the prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act. The court ruled that the State Government has the sole choice to grant or not grant the lease, and if it decides to grant the lease, it would decide on the basis of the particulars from the applicants whether to send the whole application to the Central Government for its prior approval. The court dismissed the writ petition.

The case of Selur Mines vs. Secretary to the Government, Environment and Forest Department was brought before the court to challenge a letter sent by the Secretary to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Madras. The letter required all pending and future applications for mining leases on forest lands to be sent to the Industries Department through the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Director of Geology and Mining. The petitioner, Selur Mines, argued that non-forest activities could only be initiated and continued with the prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act.

The court, however, ruled that the State Government has the sole choice to grant or not grant the lease. If it decides to grant the lease, it would decide on the basis of the particulars from the applicants whether to send the whole application to the Central Government for its prior approval. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the State Government has the authority to make decisions regarding mining leases on forest lands.

The Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity on forest land. The Act was amended in 1988 to allow State Governments to grant permission for non-forest activities on forest land, subject to certain conditions.

In the case of Selur Mines vs. Secretary to the Government, Environment and Forest Department, the petitioner argued that the State Government could not grant permission for mining leases on forest land without prior approval from the Central Government. The court, however, ruled that the State Government has the authority to grant or not grant mining leases on forest land, and if it decides to grant the lease, it would decide whether to send the whole application to the Central Government for its prior approval.

The court's decision in this case has significant implications for mining companies seeking to operate on forest land. It clarifies that the State Government has the authority to make decisions regarding mining leases on forest land, and that the Central Government's role is limited to providing prior approval for non-forest activities on forest land.

In conclusion, the case of Selur Mines vs. Secretary to the Government, Environment and Forest Department highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework governing non-forest activities on forest land. The court's decision clarifies the role of the State Government and the Central Government in granting permission for mining leases on forest land, and provides guidance for mining companies seeking to operate on forest land.
