The case in question involved a petitioner who sought to invoke the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The petitioner contended that the prosecution agency had not been acting fairly and had not collected relevant material intentionally regarding the kidnapping of the petitioner's brother by fourteen accused. The trial court dismissed an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C filed by the prosecution before the trial court for summoning eight witnesses to prove twenty-two documents mentioned in the application.

The petitioner argued that the prosecution had not collected relevant material intentionally, which would have helped in establishing the guilt of the accused. The petitioner contended that the prosecution had not collected the correspondence of his brother with the state authorities, which would have been of great help in establishing the guilt of the accused. The petitioner argued that the correspondence would have shown that his brother was kidnapped by the accused and that the accused were responsible for the kidnapping.

The trial court, however, expressed an opinion that the prosecution is required to prove that the accused were responsible for kidnapping Ramjeet, the brother of the petitioner. The court held that for establishing the said fact, the correspondence of his brother with the state authorities is of not much material consequence. The court dismissed the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C filed by the prosecution.

The petitioner then sought to invoke the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner argued that the trial court had erred in dismissing the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C filed by the prosecution. The petitioner contended that the trial court had not considered the material evidence that was available with the prosecution and had not given due weightage to the same.

The High Court, after considering the submissions made by the petitioner and the prosecution, held that the trial court had erred in dismissing the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C filed by the prosecution. The High Court held that the trial court had not considered the material evidence that was available with the prosecution and had not given due weightage to the same.

The High Court held that the prosecution had not been given a fair chance to present its case and that the trial court had erred in dismissing the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C filed by the prosecution.
