The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard several writ petitions claiming relief from an illegal demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) for mining activity on forest land. The petitioner had already deposited compensation for the diversion of forest land, but the government demanded additional NPV under a 2015 notification. The court reviewed the policy and demand notice and found that the NPV was calculated incorrectly, and ordered the government to recalculate and refund any excess amount deposited by the petitioners.

In another case, the court discussed a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cited a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considered the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involved complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

The court order also pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court order discusses the conditions for extending the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions and the guidelines for preparation of cluster mining proposals. The court also notes that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

In another case, the court order pertains to a group of 136 mining lease holders in a forest area of 281 hectares in India. The mining lease holders were asked to pay a Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of their lease period, but they refused to pay for the entire 281 hectares and also did not segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested leases to the Forest Department.

Overall, the court order highlights the complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use in Rajasthan. The court has heard multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances. The court has directed the government to recalculate and refund any excess amount deposited by the petitioners for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) for mining activity on forest land. The court has also directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested leases. The court has emphasized the importance of following the guidelines for preparation of cluster mining proposals and segregating the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area.
