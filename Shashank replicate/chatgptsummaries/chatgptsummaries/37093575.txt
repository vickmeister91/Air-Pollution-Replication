The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by M/S New Kashmir Stores against the State. The case involves the possession of ivory articles by the accused, which were recovered during a raid in 1992. The accused were charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, for non-maintenance of proper records and unlawful possession of animal articles. 

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court found a prima facie case against the accused and convicted them under section 47 r/w section 51 of the Act. The accused were sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/- each, and the case property was confiscated to the State. 

The court also discussed the applicability of the power of compounding conferred in 2003. Compounding refers to the process of settling a case by paying a fine or other penalty instead of going through a trial. The court noted that the power of compounding was not available at the time of the commission of the offence in 1992. Therefore, the court dismissed the revision filed by M/S New Kashmir Stores.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wild animals and plants, and provides for penalties for violations of its provisions. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In the present case, the accused were found to be in possession of ivory articles, which are derived from the tusks of elephants. The possession of ivory is prohibited under the Act, as elephants are a protected species. The accused were also found to have not maintained proper records of the ivory articles, which is a violation of the Act.

The court's decision to convict the accused and impose a fine is in line with the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for penalties for violations of its provisions, and the court has the power to impose fines and confiscate property in such cases. The court's decision to confiscate the case property to the State is also in line with the provisions of the Act, as it provides for the forfeiture of property derived from the commission of offences under the Act.

The court's discussion of the power of compounding is also significant. The power of compounding was conferred by an amendment to the Act in 2003. The amendment provides for the compounding of certain offences under the Act, subject to the payment of a fine. The power of compounding is intended to reduce the burden on the courts and expedite the disposal of cases. However, the court noted that the power of compounding was not available at the time of the commission of the offence in 1992. Therefore, the court dismissed the revision filed by M/S New Kashmir Stores.

In conclusion, the court's order in the present case is significant as it upholds the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and imposes penalties for violations of its provisions. The court's discussion of the power of compounding is also significant, as it highlights the limitations of the power and its applicability only to certain offences committed after the amendment in 2003. The court's decision to dismiss the revision filed by M/S New Kashmir Stores is also significant, as it reaffirms the court's commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that justice is served.
