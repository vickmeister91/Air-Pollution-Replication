The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Bimaldeep Steel Pvt. Ltd. against the Union of India and others, seeking to quash an order rejecting their revision application against the grant of a mining lease to Arcelor Mittal Steel India Limited. The petitioner also sought to set aside the recommendation and prior approval granted by the Central Government for the mining lease. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately rejected the petitioner's claims, stating that the delay in filing their application did not prejudice their case and that the recommendation in favor of Arcelor Mittal Steel India Limited was made in accordance with the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The court order states that the petitioner had knowledge of the reasons and was given an opportunity to be heard by the State Government, the Central Government, and the Revisional Authority. The petitioner suffered no prejudice, and a comparative chart showed that another party was more meritorious in technology, investment, and experience. The petitioner's case was covered by a previous case that was dismissed, and the court observed that the petitioner may have abused the process of law. The writ petition was dismissed with a token cost of Rs. 25,000 to be deposited by the petitioner with the Senior Citizen Home.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the petitioner had knowledge of the reasons for the rejection of their revision application and had been given an opportunity to be heard by the relevant authorities. This meant that the petitioner had been given a fair chance to present their case and that there was no prejudice against them.

Secondly, the court considered a comparative chart that showed that another party was more meritorious in terms of technology, investment, and experience. This meant that the petitioner's case was not as strong as that of the other party, and that the recommendation in favor of Arcelor Mittal Steel India Limited was made in accordance with the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

Thirdly, the court noted that the petitioner's case was covered by a previous case that had been dismissed. This meant that the petitioner may have been abusing the process of law by filing a similar case again.

Based on these factors, the court ultimately dismissed the writ petition with a token cost of Rs. 25,000 to be deposited by the petitioner with the Senior Citizen Home. The court's decision was a clear indication that the recommendation in favor of Arcelor Mittal Steel India Limited was made in accordance with the law and that the petitioner's claims were not strong enough to warrant a revision of the decision.
