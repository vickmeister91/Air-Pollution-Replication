The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that was filed against an order passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Sr. DN.) No.1, Chittorgarh. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, requesting that the suit proceedings be kept in abeyance till the decision of the appeal pending in the High Court. However, the application was rejected by the Trial Court, which observed that the present suit proceedings had been instituted prior to the appeal. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the provision of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply to the present suit, and that the proceedings could not be stayed on account of the pendency of the appeal.

Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with the stay of a suit pending the decision of another suit or appeal. It provides that where a suit is pending in any court in India and another suit or appeal involving the same parties and the same subject matter is pending in another court in India, the former court may stay the proceedings of the suit before it until the disposal of the other suit or appeal.

In the present case, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, seeking a stay on the proceedings of the suit pending the decision of the appeal pending in the High Court. However, the Trial Court rejected the application, stating that the present suit proceedings had been instituted prior to the appeal. The court observed that Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply to the present suit, and that the proceedings could not be stayed on account of the pendency of the appeal.

The petitioner then filed a writ petition challenging the order of the Trial Court. The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the writ petition. The court held that the provision of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply to the present suit, as the suit had been instituted prior to the appeal. The court further held that the proceedings could not be stayed on account of the pendency of the appeal.

The court's decision in this case is in line with the provisions of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The section clearly states that the stay of a suit can only be granted if another suit or appeal involving the same parties and the same subject matter is pending in another court in India. In the present case, the suit had been instituted prior to the appeal, and therefore, the provision of Section 10 did not apply.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure before filing any application or petition. It is essential to ensure that the application or petition is in line with the provisions of the Code, failing which it may be rejected by the court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed against an order passed by the Trial Court rejecting an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the provision of Section 10 did not apply to the present suit, and that the proceedings could not be stayed on account of the pendency of the appeal. The court's decision is in line with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Code before filing any application or petition.
