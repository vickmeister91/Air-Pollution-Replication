In a recent court order, a petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct respondents 1 to 8 to take necessary steps to close down the 9th and 10th respondent units for their violation of pollution acts. However, the court found that clearances had already been issued to the 9th and 10th respondents, and therefore, there cannot be any impediment created in the working of the units under the guise of public interest litigation. The writ petition was disposed of with no costs.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking a writ of mandamus to direct respondents 1 to 8 to take necessary steps to close down the 9th and 10th respondent units for their violation of pollution acts. The petitioner had argued that the units were causing severe pollution and were a threat to public health. The petitioner had also argued that the units were operating without the necessary clearances and approvals from the authorities.

However, the court found that clearances had already been issued to the 9th and 10th respondents, and therefore, there cannot be any impediment created in the working of the units under the guise of public interest litigation. The court noted that the units had obtained the necessary clearances and approvals from the authorities and were operating within the limits prescribed by the authorities.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their claims of pollution caused by the units. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any scientific data or expert opinion to support their claims. The court also observed that the authorities had conducted regular inspections of the units and had not found any violations of pollution norms.

The court further noted that the closure of the units would have a significant impact on the economy and the livelihoods of the people employed in the units. The court observed that the closure of the units would not be in the public interest and would cause more harm than good.

In light of these observations, the court disposed of the writ petition with no costs. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claims and that the units were operating within the limits prescribed by the authorities. The court also observed that the closure of the units would not be in the public interest and would cause more harm than good.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in public interest litigation. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claims of pollution caused by the units. The court also observed that the closure of the units would not be in the public interest and would cause more harm than good. The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition with no costs underscores the need for petitioners to provide evidence to support their claims and to consider the broader impact of their petitions on the economy and the livelihoods of people.
