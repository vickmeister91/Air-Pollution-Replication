The case of Sanjay Kumar vs. Central Pollution Control Board revolves around the petitioner's claim for regularization in the post of Accounts Assistant. Sanjay Kumar had been engaged as an Accounts Clerk by the Board but claimed to have been performing the duties of an Accounts Assistant. He further claimed that he had been assured by the Board that he would be absorbed in its regular service. However, the Board denied these claims and stated that Sanjay Kumar had been engaged on a daily wage basis for a clerical job with no right to claim permanent absorption on any post in the Board.

Sanjay Kumar had approached the court seeking to quash a letter of termination from the Board and be confirmed in the post of Accounts Assistant retrospectively or on any other suitable post. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that Sanjay Kumar did not possess the requisite qualifications on the date of his engagement and had no right to claim regularization.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Sanjay Kumar had been engaged as an Accounts Clerk and not an Accounts Assistant. The court noted that the job of an Accounts Assistant required certain qualifications which Sanjay Kumar did not possess at the time of his engagement. The court also observed that Sanjay Kumar had been engaged on a daily wage basis for a clerical job and had no right to claim permanent absorption on any post in the Board.

The court further noted that Sanjay Kumar had not been able to produce any evidence to support his claim that he had been assured by the Board that he would be absorbed in its regular service. The court observed that the Board had clearly stated in its reply that Sanjay Kumar had been engaged on a daily wage basis for a clerical job and had no right to claim permanent absorption on any post in the Board.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the principle of merit-based recruitment and regularization. The court has made it clear that an employee cannot claim regularization in a post for which he or she does not possess the requisite qualifications. The court has also emphasized that engagement on a daily wage basis does not confer any right to claim permanent absorption on any post in the organization.

In conclusion, the case of Sanjay Kumar vs. Central Pollution Control Board highlights the importance of merit-based recruitment and regularization. The court's decision in this case reinforces the principle that an employee must possess the requisite qualifications for the post in which he or she seeks regularization. The case also emphasizes that engagement on a daily wage basis does not confer any right to claim permanent absorption on any post in the organization.
