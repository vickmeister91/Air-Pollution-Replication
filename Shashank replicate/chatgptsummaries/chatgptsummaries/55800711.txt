The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal made by Intech Pharma Pvt. Ltd against the Goa Pollution Control Board. The appellant is an industry that produces fumigant Methyl Bromide, which is used for quarantine and pre-shipment fumigation. The respondent board had granted consent to the appellant to operate under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. However, an accident occurred on 12.4.2012, and the respondent issued a show-cause notice to the appellant, directing them to stop/suspend the operation of the unit and to comply with certain measures. The Board canceled the consent to operate order issued to the appellant on 7.8.2008 and directed them to immediately stop/suspend the operation of the unit. The appellant argued that the impugned order was illegal and that they were not given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

The court order pertains to an appeal made by a small-scale industry that had been supplying methyl bromide to the government. The industry had raised bank loans and provided employment to over a hundred people. Following an accident at the unit, the Pollution Control Board canceled the order of consent to operate, citing health concerns. The appellant was given only one day to respond to the show-cause notice, which violated the principle of natural justice. The appellant had taken steps to comply with the directions given by the Board, but the impugned order was passed hastily. The court examined the documents and found that the order was passed after due consideration of the appellant's response. The court dismissed the appeal.

The court order pertains to a case where an appellant challenged an order passed by the respondent Board canceling their consent to operate an industrial unit. The court found that the show-cause notice issued to the appellant was defective and did not adhere to principles of natural justice. The order canceling the consent to operate was made without proper consideration of the appellant's reply and was an outcome of non-application of mind. The court set aside the impugned order and allowed the appeal, leaving the parties to bear the costs.

In summary, the case involves an appeal made by Intech Pharma Pvt. Ltd against the Goa Pollution Control Board. The appellant is an industry that produces fumigant Methyl Bromide, which is used for quarantine and pre-shipment fumigation.
