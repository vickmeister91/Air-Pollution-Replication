The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a civil writ petition filed by M/s Eco Care Energy Exploration against the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and others. The petition challenged an order passed by the Board. The court held that since the petitioner had an alternative remedy available, the petition cannot be entertained. However, the petitioner was allowed to take its statutory remedy as available in the law, and the Appellate Authority was directed to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing.

The case involved a dispute between M/s Eco Care Energy Exploration and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the Board, which had directed the petitioner to pay a penalty for violating certain environmental norms. The petitioner had argued that the order was arbitrary and illegal, and had sought its quashing.

The High Court, however, held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available under the law. The court noted that the petitioner could have filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority, as provided under the relevant statute. Since the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy, the court held that the writ petition could not be entertained.

The court, however, allowed the petitioner to take its statutory remedy and file an appeal before the Appellate Authority. The court directed the Authority to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing. This was done to ensure that the petitioner's rights were not unduly delayed or denied.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that writ petitions cannot be entertained if an alternative remedy is available under the law. This principle is based on the idea that the courts should not interfere with the functioning of administrative bodies unless it is absolutely necessary. This is because administrative bodies are better equipped to deal with technical and specialized issues, and are also more accessible to the public.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of timely disposal of appeals by the Appellate Authority. The court's direction to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing is aimed at ensuring that the petitioner's rights are protected in a timely manner. This is important as delays in the disposal of appeals can often result in the denial of justice.

Overall, the Rajasthan High Court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of following the proper legal procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the courts. It also emphasizes the need for administrative bodies to function efficiently and effectively, and for the courts to ensure that the rights of litigants are protected in a timely manner.
