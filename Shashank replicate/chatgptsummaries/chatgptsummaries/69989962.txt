On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, which pertained to several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land. The court order listed multiple cases (CWP Nos.) with their respective petitioners and respondents. The cases involved individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India.

The court notes that while the facts of each case are different, the authorities have given concurrent findings that the petitioners are encroachers on government land. The petitioners rely on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicates that the state is contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court notes that some of the encroachers are proprietors of the village, while others are landless and homeless.

The court order pertains to encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court refrains from expressing views on the matter and leaves it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the state government is directed to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months.

The decision-making process involves more than one government department, and a meeting of all principal secretaries of such departments is directed to be convened. The final decision must keep in view public interest and cannot give preference to individual hardship. The policy decision will be subject to judicial review, and till then, status quo shall be maintained.
