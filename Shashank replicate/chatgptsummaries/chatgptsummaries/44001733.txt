The Kerala High Court delivered a judgment on 10th December 2015, pertaining to three writ petitions filed before it. The first petition, W.P.(C) No.18690 of 2009, was a public interest litigation that raised environmental concerns over the illegal filling of wetlands near Ashtamudi Lake. The other two petitions, W.P.(C).No. 15757 of 2008 (A) and WP(C).NO.19577 of 2009, were filed by the Chairman of Quilon Medical Trust against the report of the Kerala Lok Ayukta and certain observations made by the State Government.

The court heard the petitions on 27th October 2015 and listed the exhibits submitted by the petitioner and respondent, providing a summary of the facts of the case. The court order discussed the conversion of paddy land for the construction of a medical college by the Quilon Medical Trust. The court noted that no paddy cultivation had been noticed in the proposed area for the last ten years and that the proposed land was now unfit for paddy cultivation. The State Government had already granted permission for the conversion of the land, and the petitioner filed a writ petition challenging the decision. The court ultimately upheld the government's decision and denied the petitioner's requested reliefs. However, the court ordered a detailed environmental impact assessment study to be done before any further construction was allowed.

The court order also pertained to a complaint filed before the Kerala Lok Ayukta alleging that the Chairman of Quilon Medical Trust was converting paddy land into garden land in violation of the Kerala Land Utilisation Order, 1967, for establishing a medical college. The Lok Ayukta examined the complaint and sent a report. The Chairman of Quilon Medical Trust filed a writ petition praying for quashing the report of the Kerala Lok Ayukta. The court appointed an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the spot, who reported that reclamation activities were still going on. The court heard arguments from both sides, including on the issue of whether the writ petition was barred by laches, and reserved its judgment.

Another writ petition was filed against the construction of a hospital and college building on dry land without obtaining environmental clearance. The court considered various issues, including whether the writ petition was barred by laches, whether the petitioner could maintain the writ petition as a public interest litigation, and whether the 8th respondent was obliged to obtain environmental clearance. The court ultimately allowed the petitioner to depute an Advocate Commissioner to conduct a spot inspection of the premises and report on the extent of land filled up and any illegal activities undertaken by the 8th respondent.

The court order also pertained to a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation against the alleged illegal filling up of paddy lands in Kollam district, Kerala. The petitioner, a registered body formed mainly for the protection of the environment and matters of public interest, sought protection of wetlands and paddy fields from being converted into concrete jungles. The court appointed an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the premises and report on the extent of land filled up and the activities undertaken by the 8th respondent to fill up the paddy lands illegally. The Advocate Commissioner's report found that the 8th respondent was still continuing with filling of paddy land, and part of the property still continued as marshy. The court rejected the 8th respondent's submission to dismiss the writ petition on the ground of laches and held that the petitioner had raised an issue of public interest concerning the environment and ecology.

The court order discussed a case where a petitioner obtained permission to convert land for development but faced objections from third parties claiming adverse effects on agriculture. The court found that since permission was granted after following proper procedure, third parties had no right to hinder development. The court also discussed the principles of public interest litigation and the need for genuine public interest in such cases. The court found that the petitioner had the right to file the present case as it was filed in a statutory forum and there was no evidence of personal gain or private motive.

The court order also discussed various issues raised by the petitioner and the respondent in a writ petition related to environmental degradation caused by illegal filling of paddy fields and wetlands. The court distinguished this case from a previous case where the petitioner challenged developmental activities that resulted in damage to a road. The court also addressed the issue of non-joinder of necessary parties and the requirement of obtaining environmental clearance under a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. The court found that the petitioner had made sufficient pleadings regarding the violation of the notification and that the respondent was aware of the case based on the notification. The court allowed the petitioner to file an additional affidavit and gave the respondent time to file a counter affidavit.

The court order discussed the requirements for prior environmental clearance for construction projects in India. It cited a notification from 2006 that requires projects falling under certain categories to obtain clearance from the Central Government or State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority before beginning construction. The order also addressed the issue of non-constitution of the SEIAA in the State of Kerala and concluded that projects without a duly constituted SEIAA must be assessed by the Central Government and treated as Category A projects. The order also referenced the Kerala Land Utilisation Order of 1967, which empowers the State to require landholders to grow specified crops and prohibits the conversion of land cultivated with food crops for any other purpose without written
