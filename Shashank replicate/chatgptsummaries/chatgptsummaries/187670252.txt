The court order in question pertains to a case between Save Th. Its Chairperson and the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The case revolves around the construction of a cattle pound in the region, and the court has received a status report from the Divisional Commissioner stating that 42 kanals 11 marlas of land have been handed over to the Jammu Municipal Corporation for the construction of the cattle pound. However, the Forest Department is yet to hand over the remaining land required for the construction.

The Forest Department has informed the court that if forest land is to be diverted for any purpose other than forestry, the Authority has to proceed in terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Forest Conservation Act, 1997. This means that the Forest Department has to follow certain procedures before handing over the land for the construction of the cattle pound.

The court has directed the Jammu Municipal Corporation to file a status report on the construction of the cattle pound and the tagging of animals. The court has also listed the case for further hearing on 14th December, 2018.

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures when it comes to the use of forest land. The Forest Department has a responsibility to ensure that forest land is not diverted for any purpose other than forestry, and this responsibility must be taken seriously. The court's decision to direct the Jammu Municipal Corporation to file a status report on the construction of the cattle pound and the tagging of animals is a step in the right direction, as it will help to ensure that the construction is being carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.

It is important to note that the construction of the cattle pound is not the only issue at stake here. The case also raises questions about the use of forest land in general, and the need to balance the needs of development with the need to protect the environment. The Jammu and Kashmir Forest Conservation Act, 1997, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to strike this balance, and it is important that it is followed in letter and spirit.
