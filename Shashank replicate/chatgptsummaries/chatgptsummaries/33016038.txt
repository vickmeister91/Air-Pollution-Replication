In a recent case, the petitioner filed an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash orders passed by the learned A.D.J.-VIII, Vaishali. The petitioner sought leave to withdraw the application in order to file an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure after the prosecution evidence is closed and the case is fixed for adducing evidence on behalf of defence. The court granted leave and disposed of the application.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner sought to quash orders passed by the learned A.D.J.-VIII, Vaishali. However, the petitioner later sought leave to withdraw the application in order to file an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the power of the court to issue summons or order for production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner sought to file an application under this section after the prosecution evidence is closed and the case is fixed for adducing evidence on behalf of defence.

The court granted leave to the petitioner to withdraw the application and file an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at a later stage. The court disposed of the application in light of the petitioner's request.

In conclusion, the court granted leave to the petitioner to withdraw the application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and file an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at a later stage. The court disposed of the application in light of the petitioner's request. This case highlights the importance of understanding the various provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the inherent powers of the High Court to secure the ends of justice.
