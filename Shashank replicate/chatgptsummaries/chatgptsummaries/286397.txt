The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Bhagawan Bhoi, who had sought permission to cut trees on his land. The Divisional Forest Officer had issued a communication asking him to stop felling trees until further orders. The petitioner had earlier been granted permission to cut trees, but the Divisional Forest Officer had revoked it. The court held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applies to all forest lands, whether privately owned or not, and that no permission to cut trees can be granted without the prior concurrence of the Central Government.

The court dismissed the writ petition and directed the State Government to strictly follow the directions of the Supreme Court in T. N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad etc. v. Union of India and Ors.; AIR 1997 SC 1228, and not permit any cutting of trees from forest lands.
