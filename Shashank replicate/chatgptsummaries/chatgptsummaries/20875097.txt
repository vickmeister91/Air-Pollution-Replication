The National Green Tribunal in India recently issued a court order regarding appeals made by several stone crushing businesses in Haryana against an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The businesses challenged the legality and correctness of the order, which was upheld by the appellate authority. The court disposed of the appeals, as they arose out of similar facts and raised common legal issues. The court referred to the specific facts in the cases and took up one appeal as the lead case for reference of the facts.

The court discussed the guidelines for installation and operation of stone crushers and the benefits of Schedule II entry (n) to the stone crushers installed and in operation for a continuous period of one year before the coming into force of the notification of 1997. The court also mentioned the consent granted to the businesses by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The court order did not provide any further information on the outcome of the case.

Another court order discussed a case where a stone crusher unit was accused of violating pollution control laws. The unit had applied for consent from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in 2011-12, but a show cause notice was issued in 2012 stating that the unit was running in violation of the law. The unit submitted a reply denying the violation, but the HSPCB issued another show cause notice stating that the application was incomplete and did not meet the requirements of the law. The unit submitted a reply to this notice as well, but the HSPCB refused to grant consent to the unit in March 2012. The court order did not provide any further information on the outcome of the case.

The court order pertained to the refusal of consent for the year 2011-12 under Section 21/22 of Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to M/s. Jai Mata Di Stone Crusher, Doiwala, Yamuna Nagar. The order stated that the unit failed to comply with various provisions of the Air Act 1981 and the sitting parameters of the Notification dated 18.12.1997. The order also mentioned that the unit did not submit the operation schedule of the stone crusher, analysis report under Air Act, 1981, and did not meet the sitting parameters as per the notification dated 18.12.1997. The court upheld the refusal of consent and stated that the unit is liable for legal action under Section 37/38/39 of the Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and all other rules/laws/orders by the Govt/Board from time to time as applicable in the matter.

The court order stated that stone crushers create health hazards for workers and surrounding populations due to fine fugitive dust emissions and high levels of noise. The court also noted that air pollution caused by the stone crushing industry has adverse implications for both occupational and community health. The court emphasized that human health must prevail over private business interests. The court also discussed the protective measures and anti-pollution devices that stone crushers are required to take and install. The court concluded that the stone crushers in question are violating the distance restrictions imposed by notifications and that their cumulative effect would be injurious to the health of nearby villagers. The court also noted that the appeals may be barred by time limitations.

The court order stated that the provision in Section 16 cannot be interpreted to give the Tribunal the power to condone delays beyond 90 days. The Supreme Court has already answered this question in a previous case. The court also cited other cases where the power to condone delays is limited by the specific language of the law. The court concluded that the provisions of the Limitation Act cannot be called upon to supplement the provisions of the special law, and that the nature of the remedy provided by the special law should govern the matter.

The court order discussed the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and concluded that the provisions of the Limitation Act cannot be invoked if they conflict with the special law's provisions. The court also emphasized that the use of negative language in a provision indicates that it is mandatory and cannot be overridden by equitable principles. The court dismissed several appeals on the grounds of limitation and stated that the parties must bear their own costs.

Finally, a court order listed the names of four individuals, including a justice and three expert members, and the date and location of January 9, 2014 in New Delhi. The number "30" was also included, but without context it is unclear what it refers to.

In summary, the court orders discussed various cases related to stone crushing businesses and their compliance with pollution control laws. The court emphasized the importance of protecting human health over private business interests and discussed the guidelines for installation and operation of stone crushers. The court also discussed the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and dismissed several appeals on the grounds of limitation.
