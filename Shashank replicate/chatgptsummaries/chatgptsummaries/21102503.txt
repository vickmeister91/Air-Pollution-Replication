The court recently heard an application for anticipatory bail filed by Ramdayal, Vishnu Prasad, and Hemraj in a case related to the killing of a mouse deer in 2010. The prosecution alleged that the applicants conspired to kill the deer and distributed its meat. The co-accused, Ram Lakhan, who had possession of the seized property related to the offense, is said to be dead. The applicants' counsel argued that nothing was to be recovered from Hemraj's possession, and he should be released on anticipatory bail. However, the panel lawyer for the state argued that the applicants had been absconding since 2010, and firearms were to be recovered from them. The court dismissed the bail application, stating that it was not a fit case for anticipatory bail.
