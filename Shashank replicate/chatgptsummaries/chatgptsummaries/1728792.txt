The court order pertains to a case between M/S. International Woolen Mills and M/S. Standard Wool (U.K.) Limited. The dispute arose when the Appellant claimed that the goods purchased from the Respondent were of inferior quality and refused to pay the price. The Respondent obtained an ex-parte decree from the Central London County Court, which was challenged by the Appellant in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ludhiana. The Appellant's application was dismissed, and they filed a Civil Revision, which was also dismissed. The High Court found that the decree was not on merits but dismissed the Revision on the ground of constructive res-judicata. The Appellant filed an appeal against the dismissal of their Revision, while the Respondent filed an appeal against the portion of the judgment that held that the decree was not on merit. The court also considered whether the decree could be executed in India and whether it was passed on merits.

The court order discusses various cases and principles related to the question of whether a decree was passed on merits or not. The court concludes that the burden of proving that a decree is not on merits is on the appellants and that the decree can only be considered on merits if the court has gone through the case made by the plaintiff and considered the evidence presented. The court also notes that a decree passed in absence of the defendant is not necessarily a decree on merits and that the rules of procedure must be followed for a decree to be considered on merits.

The court order discusses the burden of proof in proving that a decree is not on merits. While the burden is on the party alleging it, it is not necessary to prove the state of mind of the judge who passed the decree. The party must show that the decree does not show that it is on merits, and provide evidence such as the rules of the court, the existence or lack of material before the court, and the manner in which the decree was passed. The court must have applied its mind to the matter and considered the evidence to determine if the judgment is on the merits. The case cites several authorities to support this proposition.

The court order discusses a case where an ex parte decree was obtained, and the defendant argued that it was not a judgment on merits and therefore could not be enforced in India. The court agreed with the defendant, citing previous cases and stating that a decree obtained solely on the defendant's default of appearance cannot be considered a judgment on merits. The court found that the decree in question was not a judgment on merits and therefore could not be enforced in India. One appeal was allowed and the other was dismissed, with no order as to costs in either case.
