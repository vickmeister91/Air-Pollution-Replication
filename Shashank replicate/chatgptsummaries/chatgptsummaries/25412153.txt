The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner had borrowed a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- on 28.10.2012, promising to pay the said amount with interest. The accused gave a cheque dated 28.12.2012 for Rs.3,00,000/- in favour of the complainant. However, when the said cheque was presented on 28.12.2012, it was dishonoured on the ground of insufficient funds. The complainant issued a statutory notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and since the accused did not pay the money, he filed a complaint in CC.No.289 of 2013 before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Salem, for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused.

The petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to set aside an order dated 10.12.2014 in CMP No.4576 of 2014 in CC.No.289 of 2013 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Salem. The petitioner contended that the order passed by the learned Magistrate was erroneous and illegal, and that the trial court had failed to appreciate the evidence on record. The petitioner further contended that the order was passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard, and that it was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition as it was devoid of merits. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for interference under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further observed that the trial court had considered all the evidence on record and had passed the order after due application of mind. The court held that the order passed by the trial court was not erroneous or illegal, and that there was no violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court also ordered the trial court to proceed with the trial expeditiously. The court observed that the trial court had already recorded the evidence of the complainant and his witnesses, and that the accused had also been examined. The court directed the trial court to complete the trial within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the order.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal original petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to set aside an order dated 10.12.2014 in CMP No.4576 of 2014 in CC.No.289 of 2013 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Salem.
