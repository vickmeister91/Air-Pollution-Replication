The Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation) Act, 1975, is a short enactment with four sections, and Sections 3 and 4 are relevant to the case. Several writ petitions were filed against the Act, challenging a notification issued by the government in 1998 that deleted nearly 30 acres from the limits of Sri. Chamarajendra Park Area, including the premises of Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home. The court was asked to quash the notification and declare the whole of Cubbon Park area as forest land subject to the restriction and protection under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court order pertains to the deletion of certain areas from the Cubbon Park in Bangalore, India, which includes the premises of Raj Bhavan, Legislators' Home, and a small portion of LRDE Premises. The Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1975, which aims to provide parks and open spaces for public recreation, is discussed in detail. The court examines the legality of the impugned notification of 1998, which deleted a part of the additional area within the park limits, and concludes that the government had the power to exclude the area for facilitating necessary constructions. The court also notes that the excluded area was not accessible to the public and that the overall public interest was considered while making the decision.

The court finds that the decision to delete the area is not arbitrary and does not violate any environmental laws. However, the court directs that no further constructions be made within the limits of the park specified in the 1998 notification without obtaining clearance. The State Government has sought permission to set up reception counters outside the park limits for security reasons, which the court is yet to decide on.

The court order also states that due to recent militant activity, the security of the Vidhana Soudha building needs to be adequately protected. The High Court has also been affected, and provisions need to be made for its security. The Commissioner of Police will suggest security measures after consulting with the Registrar General. The State Government has been granted permission to make adequate security arrangements, but only for the Reception Counters and gates along the fence of the High Court building. The layout plan must be implemented to ensure proper security measures.

In summary, the court order discusses a notification issued under the Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation) Act, which deleted about 30 acres from the park limits for proposed constructions. The court finds that the decision to delete the area is not arbitrary and does not violate any environmental laws. However, the court directs that no further constructions be made within the limits of the park specified in the 1998 notification without obtaining clearance. The State Government has sought permission to set up reception counters outside the park limits for security reasons, which the court is yet to decide on. The court also notes that due to recent militant activity, the security of the Vidhana Soudha building needs to be adequately protected, and the State Government has been granted permission to make adequate security arrangements, but only for the Reception Counters and gates along the fence of the High Court building.
