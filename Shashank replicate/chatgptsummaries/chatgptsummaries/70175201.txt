In a recent court order, Dharam Singh and Ganpat were granted bail after being arrested for hunting deer and possessing deer meat and other parts. The court found it appropriate to release them on bail without commenting on the merits of the case. The applicants were directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The case involved allegations of illegal hunting and possession of deer meat and other parts. The accused, Dharam Singh and Ganpat, were arrested and charged with violating wildlife protection laws. The court, however, did not comment on the merits of the case and instead focused on the issue of bail.

The court found it appropriate to grant bail to the accused, considering the circumstances of the case. The applicants were directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section requires the accused to appear before the court as and when required and not to commit any offence while on bail.

The decision to grant bail to the accused was based on several factors. The court considered the nature of the offence, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice. The court also took into account the fact that the accused had no previous criminal record and were not likely to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. Bail is a fundamental right of every accused person, and it should be granted unless there are compelling reasons to deny it. In this case, the court found no such reasons and therefore granted bail to the accused.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the accused are innocent. The trial will continue, and the accused will have to prove their innocence in court. The court's decision to grant bail only means that the accused will be released from custody until the trial is completed.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Dharam Singh and Ganpat in the case of illegal hunting and possession of deer meat and other parts is a reflection of the principles of justice and fairness. The court found it appropriate to release them on bail without commenting on the merits of the case. The applicants were directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. The trial will continue, and the accused will have to prove their innocence in court.
