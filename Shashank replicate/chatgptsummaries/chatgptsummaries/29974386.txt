The Madras High Court recently transferred a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to the National Green Tribunal. The petition was filed by A. Latchathipathi against the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board, Corporation of Chennai, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Board, and three companies. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to direct the first respondent to issue directions for closure and stoppage of power supply to all industries in the area, including the fifth, sixth, and seventh respondent units, under Section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The petitioner's main contention was that the industries in the area were causing severe air pollution, which was affecting the health of the residents. The petitioner argued that the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board had failed to take any action against the industries despite repeated complaints. The petitioner also alleged that the Corporation of Chennai, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, and Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Board had granted permission to the industries without conducting any environmental impact assessment.

The Madras High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, decided to transfer the case to the National Green Tribunal. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal had the expertise to deal with environmental matters and would be better equipped to handle the case. The court directed the National Green Tribunal to list the case on 30.03.2015.

The transfer of the case to the National Green Tribunal is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental issues in India. The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 to handle environmental disputes and has since become an important forum for resolving environmental issues. The transfer of the case to the National Green Tribunal also shows that the judiciary is taking a proactive role in protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with environmental regulations.

The case also highlights the need for stricter enforcement of environmental regulations in India. Despite the existence of laws such as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, industries continue to flout environmental regulations and cause severe pollution. The case also highlights the need for greater public awareness about environmental issues and the need for citizens to take an active role in protecting the environment.

In conclusion, the transfer of the writ petition filed by A. Latchathipathi to the National Green Tribunal is a significant development in the fight against environmental pollution in India. The case highlights the need for stricter enforcement of environmental regulations and greater public awareness about environmental issues. The transfer of the case to the National Green Tribunal also shows that the judiciary is taking a proactive role in protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with environmental regulations.
