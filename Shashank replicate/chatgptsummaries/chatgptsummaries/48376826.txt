The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Mohammed Pareri and others against the State of Kerala and others. The petitioners provided exhibits of orders issued by the fourth respondent canceling the number issued to the apartment. The court delivered its decision on July 14, 2016. The court order pertains to multiple petitions filed regarding unauthorized constructions in two apartment complexes. The court cancels the numbering of the apartments in question based on a government order and a vigilance report that found violations and contamination of nearby well water. The ownership of the apartments is not in dispute, and the owners/occupiers have approached the court for relief. An interim stay of status quo has been granted, allowing the owners/occupiers to continue residing in the apartments.

The court has issued an interim stay of status quo in a case involving two apartment complexes. The owners/occupiers of the apartments claim that remedial measures have been taken to address pollution concerns and that the construction was completed with the necessary permits. The court has ordered the Panchayath to inspect the premises and issue notices to the occupants/owners of the buildings regarding any violations of building rules. The owners/occupiers may approach the government for regularisation of any violations. The court has also directed the Pollution Control Board to inspect the properties and verify any pollution concerns. The court has left open the possibility of a suit for damages against the builder of one of the apartment complexes.
