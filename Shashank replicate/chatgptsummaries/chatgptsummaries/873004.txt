In 2007, the Rajasthan High Court issued a judgment regarding the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur. The case involved a writ petition filed by respondents seeking the quashing of a notice inviting tenders and the preparation of a stable policy for registering vehicles for tourism purposes. The court issued various directions, including the removal of encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone, closure of the park for tourists twice a week, and the regulation of public transport for pilgrims visiting the Ganesh Temple.

The court emphasized the need to comply with statutory provisions for controlling pollution and protecting wildlife. The court stayed the operation of the judgment and directed the state government to comply with the statutory provisions. The appeals were listed for final disposal on September 19, 2007.

The Ranthambore National Park is a popular tourist destination in Rajasthan, known for its tigers and other wildlife. However, the park has been facing various issues related to pollution, encroachment, and over-tourism. The writ petition filed by the respondents sought to address some of these issues and ensure sustainable tourism in the park.

The court's judgment focused on various aspects of the park's management, including the registration of vehicles for tourism purposes, the regulation of public transport for pilgrims, and the removal of encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone. The court also emphasized the need to comply with statutory provisions for controlling pollution and protecting wildlife.

One of the key directions issued by the court was the closure of the park for tourists twice a week. This was aimed at reducing the impact of tourism on the park's ecosystem and allowing the wildlife to thrive. The court also directed the state government to prepare a stable policy for registering vehicles for tourism purposes, which would ensure that the number of vehicles entering the park is regulated and does not exceed the carrying capacity of the park.

The court's judgment also highlighted the importance of protecting the park's eco-sensitive zone, which is critical for the survival of the park's wildlife. The court directed the authorities to remove encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone and ensure that no further encroachments take place.

The court's judgment was a significant step towards ensuring sustainable tourism in the Ranthambore National Park. However, the implementation of the court's directions was not without challenges. The state government faced difficulties in enforcing the closure of the park for tourists twice a week, as it was a popular tourist destination. The government also faced challenges in removing encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone, as it involved the displacement of people who had been living there for generations.

Despite these challenges, the court's judgment had a positive impact on the park's management. The closure of the park for tourists twice a week helped reduce the impact of tourism on the park's ecosystem, and the removal of encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone helped protect the park's wildlife. The court's emphasis on complying with statutory provisions for controlling pollution and protecting wildlife also helped raise awareness about the importance of sustainable tourism in the park.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's judgment regarding the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur was a significant step towards ensuring sustainable tourism in the park. The court's directions focused on various aspects of the park's management, including the registration of vehicles for tourism purposes, the regulation of public transport for pilgrims, and the removal of encroachments in the eco-sensitive zone. The court's emphasis on complying with statutory provisions for controlling pollution and protecting wildlife also helped raise awareness about the importance of sustainable tourism in the park. Despite the challenges faced in implementing the court's directions, the judgment had a positive impact on the park's management and helped protect the park's ecosystem and wildlife.
