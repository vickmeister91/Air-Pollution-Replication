The court orders discussed in this text relate to a case of unauthorized construction of 26 shops on a common plot of a housing society in Jamnagar. The petitioner alleges that the respondent No.4 constructed the shops without any permission from the Jamnagar Urban Development Authority or the Jamnagar Municipal Corporation. The court directed the respondents to file affidavits indicating whether the area in dispute is the common plot of the society and whether any permission had been granted for making the construction on the said common plot. The affidavits have been filed by the respondents, and the matter is pending further hearing.

In another court order, the respondent parties have filed affidavits denying the allegations and stating that the matter is already pending before a civil court. The petitioner's counsel argues that the construction is illegal and violates municipal laws and fundamental rights. The counsel cites several Supreme Court decisions in support of their argument and seeks a direction to demolish the unauthorized construction and restore the common plot to its original position.

The court heard submissions from all parties involved and noted that the construction was unauthorized and violated regulations. The court ordered the demolition of the shops and criticized the authorities for their failure to act against illegal construction. The court also referred to the larger issue of illegal and unauthorized construction in the country.

The court order states that no construction can be made on a common plot, and that the construction of 26 shops on a common plot without valid permission is not permissible in law. The court also rejects the argument that a pending civil suit precludes a public interest litigation from being entertained. The court further notes that the Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorized Development Act, 2011 does not apply to the case at hand, and that the respondents are trying to stall the proceedings and save the construction at any cost. The court cites previous cases and observations to support its decision.

The court order cites several cases where the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of planned development of cities and the duty of municipal authorities to prevent unauthorized constructions. The order notes that illegal constructions have become a serious problem in many parts of the country, causing harm to the environment, infrastructure, and public health. The court also highlights the importance of zoning and building regulations in achieving public welfare and safety, and warns that violations of these laws can have serious consequences for present and future generations.

The court order highlights the negative impact of traffic congestion on the health of road users, particularly pedestrians and those from weaker sections of society who cannot afford air-conditioned cars. The court emphasizes the importance of adhering to town planning schemes and regulations to prevent illegal and unauthorized constructions, which have been encouraged and supported by the state apparatus. The court cites previous judgments and observations by the Supreme Court on the need for planned development of cities and the importance of enforcing laws to protect the environment and public health. The court questions the role of authorities in allowing illegal constructions to take place and calls for punishment of those responsible.

In another court order, the court questions the authorities' silence during the construction and notes that a criminal prosecution has been instituted against one of the buyers for cheating. The court cites the principles of public life and emphasizes that holders of public office should act in the public interest and be accountable for their decisions. The court orders the demolition of the unauthorized construction and warns that failure to comply will result in stern action against responsible officers. The court refrains from ordering an inquiry into how the unauthorized construction came about.

Overall, these court orders highlight the issue of unauthorized construction and the importance of adhering to town planning schemes and regulations to prevent such constructions. The court emphasizes the duty of municipal authorities to prevent unauthorized constructions and the need for punishment of those responsible for allowing such constructions to take place. The court also highlights the negative impact of unauthorized constructions on the environment, infrastructure, and public health.
