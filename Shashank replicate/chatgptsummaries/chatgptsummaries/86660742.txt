The National Green Tribunal recently heard two applications, one filed by M/s Cox India Ltd. and the other by Balram Raikwar. M/s Cox India Ltd. had applied for additional capacity of 8 KL per day for their distillery unit, which was granted by the State Pollution Control Board but later cancelled. The company challenged the cancellation, claiming it violated principles of natural justice. Balram Raikwar filed an application seeking legal action against M/s Cox India Ltd. for not fulfilling the condition of planting trees to minimize pollution.

The Central Pollution Control Board stated that their communication was not statutory in nature and did not direct the State Pollution Control Board to withdraw the expansion proposal. The Tribunal appreciated the frank stand taken by the Central Pollution Control Board and examined the contents of the communication.

The court order discusses a case involving a distillery company and the withdrawal of permission to establish additional facilities. The court notes that the Central Pollution Control Board has not completed a study on whether grain-based distilleries are more polluting than molasses-based ones. The court also finds that the State Pollution Control Board did not follow the principles of natural justice in withdrawing permission without issuing a show cause notice. The court concludes that the project proponent cannot claim a right to operate without complying with all conditions of consent to establish. The court also discusses the history of the principles of natural justice in Indian law.

The court order discusses the meaning of "due process of law" and the basic requirements it implies, such as an objective standard of conduct, notice to the accused, a reasonable opportunity to defend oneself, and an impartial tribunal. The order also highlights the importance of natural justice and how it is inherent in the principles of law. The order cites various judicial pronouncements to support the view that natural justice is so basic that even if a statutory law fails to state it explicitly, its presence shall be inferred. The latest principle in natural justice is that giving an opportunity to the person before taking away his right, which is already conferred to him, is not merely natural justice but fundamental in nature, which is inherent.

The court order discusses the concept of natural justice and its evolution over time through judicial interpretation. The order emphasizes that no person can be a judge in their own cause and that administrative or quasi-judicial acts cannot take away a person's rights without providing them with an opportunity to be heard. The order also discusses the power of the State Pollution Control Board under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and concludes that the power cannot be used to revoke or withdraw a permission already granted. The order also highlights the attitude of the State Pollution Control Board towards the project proponent and their failure to address the condition of the unit.

In another case, a distillery was granted permission to establish under certain conditions. However, a joint inspection report revealed that the plant was not complying with environmental protection norms and that the existing effluent treatment plant was non-functional. The court set aside the impugned order and directed the project proponent to plant a minimum of 3000 trees as an interim measure before any decision is made regarding the continuation of the project. The court also held the SPCB and MPPCB responsible for failing to provide accurate information and for causing pollution.

The court has directed a project proponent to plant a minimum of 3000 trees within three months and maintain them for three years, failing which they will have to pay Rs. 5 lakhs as compensation. The amount will be kept in a separate account as an Environmental Protection Fund and can be used for environmental protection in the state. The court has also urged the State Pollution Control Board to take urgent steps to meet the increasing challenges of environmental protection and degradation. The court has suggested that the MPPCB form a separate research wing with adequate manpower and budget support to improve environmental governance. The court appreciates the efforts made by various parties involved in the case.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed various cases involving distilleries and their compliance with environmental protection norms. The court emphasized the importance of natural justice and due process of law in administrative and quasi-judicial acts. The court also directed project proponents to plant trees as an interim measure and urged the State Pollution Control Board to take urgent steps to improve environmental governance. The court's orders serve as a reminder of the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.
