The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Ghadsi Ram against Asstt. Engineer Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Another. The petitioner sought direction to accept the deposit of the amount for electricity connection at his well in his agricultural land. The respondents had issued a demand note for depositing further amount, but the petitioner was not allowed to do so. 

In response to the writ petition, the respondents raised preliminary issues, stating that the petitioner did not furnish the required certificate of the well, having been constructed prior to 5-12-2005, in terms of the notification dated 5-12-2005, issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. 

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court dismissed the writ petition. The court stated that the relief prayed for by the petitioner cannot be allowed. Additionally, any amount deposited by the petitioner towards the electricity connection in issue must be refunded along with 6% per annum from the date of its deposit to the date of refund.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner failed to provide the required certificate of the well's construction date. The notification issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, required such a certificate for wells constructed prior to 5-12-2005. Since the petitioner did not provide this certificate, the court could not grant the relief sought.

The court's decision to refund the amount deposited by the petitioner was based on the fact that the petitioner was not allowed to deposit the further amount demanded by the respondents. The court found that the respondents were at fault for not allowing the petitioner to deposit the further amount, and therefore, the amount already deposited must be refunded.

In conclusion, the court order in question dismissed the writ petition filed by Ghadsi Ram against Asstt. Engineer Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Another. The court found that the relief sought by the petitioner could not be granted due to the petitioner's failure to provide the required certificate of the well's construction date. Additionally, the court ordered that any amount deposited by the petitioner towards the electricity connection in issue must be refunded along with 6% per annum from the date of its deposit to the date of refund.
