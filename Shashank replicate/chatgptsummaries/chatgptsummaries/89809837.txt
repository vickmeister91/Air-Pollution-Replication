Custodial interrogation is a process by which an accused individual is questioned by law enforcement officials while in custody. It is often used in cases where the accused is suspected of having committed a serious offence and there is a risk that they may flee or tamper with evidence if released on bail.

The court's decision to dismiss the bail application and order custodial interrogation is based on the principle that the accused individuals must be held accountable for their actions. It is also intended to ensure that they do not pose a threat to public safety while the investigation is ongoing.

The dismissal of the bail application means that the accused individuals will remain in custody until the investigation is complete. This may take several weeks or even months, depending on the complexity of the case and the amount of evidence that needs to be gathered.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by two accused individuals for offences under the Arms Act. The court has dismissed the application and ordered custodial interrogation, citing the need to ensure public safety and hold the accused individuals accountable for their actions. The dismissal of the bail application means that the accused individuals will remain in custody until the investigation is complete.
