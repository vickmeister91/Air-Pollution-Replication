The Jharkhand High Court recently issued a writ of mandamus directing respondents to ensure that no sewerage or affluent is drained into a public pathway in a residential area. This was in response to respondent No. 9, Ashok Chemicals, carrying on the manufacture of soap and polluting the environment. The court found that the State Pollution Control Board was remiss in performing its duties and in ensuring the enforcement of the Environment (Protection) Act, the Air Act, the Water Act, and the Noise Pollution Control Rules.

The Pollution Control Board has now filed a counter affidavit stating that the Industry concerned run by respondent No. 9 has not obtained the requisite permissions under the Air Act and the Water Act and it was, in fact, causing pollution. The court has restrained respondent No. 9, Ashok Chemicals, from continuing to work its soap unit without complying with the requirements of the Water Act, the Air Act, and the Environmental Protection Act. The court has also ordered that the requisite consents be obtained under the Water Act and the Air Act, and that accepted pollution control devices be adopted.

The court's decision is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with the relevant laws and regulations. The court's decision is also a reminder to the State Pollution Control Board of its responsibilities and the need to enforce the laws and regulations that are in place to protect the environment.

The court's decision is particularly important given the increasing concern about the impact of pollution on public health and the environment. Pollution is a major problem in many parts of the world, and it is essential that governments and industries take steps to reduce pollution and protect the environment.

The court's decision is also a reminder of the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by the Pollution Control Board and the concerns raised by the residents of the area. The court's decision shows that public participation can play a crucial role in ensuring that environmental laws and regulations are enforced.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with the relevant laws and regulations. The decision is a reminder to the State Pollution Control Board of its responsibilities and the need to enforce the laws and regulations that are in place to protect the environment. The decision is also a reminder of the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making.
