The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by V.S Sunilkumar and P.K Raju against the State of Kerala. The petitioners sought a writ in the nature of mandamus to command the third respondent to arrive at an independent opinion regarding the evidence collected in Crime No.6/2014 of the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau, Thiruvananthapuram.

The court, however, dismissed the writ petition as premature, as the final report was awaited. The court held that the petitioners' contention could be agitated at the appropriate stage. The court's decision was based on the fact that the final report had not yet been submitted, and therefore, it was premature to seek a writ in the nature of mandamus.

The court's decision was based on the principle of judicial restraint, which requires courts to refrain from intervening in matters that are still in the process of being resolved. The court held that it was not appropriate to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus at this stage, as the final report had not yet been submitted.

The court's decision was also based on the principle of separation of powers, which requires courts to respect the role of other branches of government. The court held that it was not appropriate to intervene in the investigative process of the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau, as this would be an encroachment on the executive's powers.

The court's decision was therefore a balanced one, taking into account the principles of judicial restraint and separation of powers. The court recognized the importance of the petitioners' concerns, but also recognized the need to respect the investigative process of the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau.

Overall, the court's decision was a measured one, reflecting the court's commitment to upholding the rule of law and respecting the role of other branches of government. The court's decision also highlights the importance of judicial restraint and the need for courts to exercise caution when intervening in matters that are still in the process of being resolved.
