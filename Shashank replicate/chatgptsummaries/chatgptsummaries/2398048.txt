Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a suit for recovery filed by the plaintiff against the defendant. In the first case, the plaintiff's legal heirs filed a suit against the defendant, who was a tenant in a property owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had not paid rent, water, and electricity bills for several years and had also caused damage to the property. The defendant argued that the suit was not maintainable as the plaintiff had not approached the court with clean hands and had suppressed material facts. However, the court found that the suit was within the limitation and jurisdiction of the court and that the defendant had not conclusively proved that he was not associated with the business of the firm. The court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 13,357/- with interest at the rate of 15% per annum.

In the second case, the court order states that the defendant, Sri Krishna Dyes Corporation, is liable to pay arrears of rent and other charges to the plaintiff, Sushil Kr. Aggarwal, for occupying a four-room flat in Delhi. The defendant's denial of liability is deemed evasive, and the plaintiff is entitled to a money decree of Rs. 10,275 with simple interest at 9% per annum. The court also awards costs to the plaintiff.

In the third case, the plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant for recovery of arrears of rent and other charges for occupying a four-room flat in Delhi. The defendant denied liability and claimed that the plaintiff had not approached the court with clean hands. However, the court found that the plaintiff had approached the court with clean hands and that the defendant's denial of liability was evasive. The court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 10,275 with simple interest at 9% per annum and awarded costs to the plaintiff.

In all three cases, the plaintiffs had filed suits for recovery of arrears of rent and other charges against the defendants. The defendants had denied liability and claimed that the plaintiffs had not approached the court with clean hands. However, the courts found that the plaintiffs had approached the court with clean hands and that the defendants' denial of liability was evasive. The courts ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the arrears of rent and other charges with interest and awarded costs to the plaintiffs.
