The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes between companies and workers, with each case presenting unique circumstances and evidence. In the first case, a worker claimed that his services were terminated illegally, alleging that the company did not provide legitimate dues and manipulated records. The worker also claimed that he was terminated without notice or any charge of misconduct. The company, on the other hand, contended that the worker had submitted his resignation after being confronted with a charge sheet for misconduct. The company argued that the worker was employed on a contractual basis and had numerous complaints against him.

The court heard arguments from both sides and examined evidence before making a decision. In this case, the court found that the evidence presented by the company was more convincing and ruled in their favor. The court found that the worker had indeed submitted his resignation after being confronted with the charge sheet for misconduct. The court also found that the worker was employed on a contractual basis and had numerous complaints against him. Therefore, the court ruled that the worker's services were not terminated illegally.

In the second case, a workman was dismissed without an inquiry. The management claimed that the workman had resigned, but the evidence presented did not support this claim. The court also considered the charges against the workman, including causing an accident and not attending to his duties. The court found that the evidence presented by the management was sufficient to justify the dismissal. However, the court allowed the management to lead evidence to support their decision.

In the third case, a workman was accused of rash and negligent driving resulting in an accident and loss of Rs. 4,000 to the school he worked for. The court found the charges to be true and justified the workman's dismissal. However, the management was ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 30,000 to the workman for falsely claiming that he had resigned. The court also cited a Supreme Court ruling that no bus belonging to an educational institution should be driven by a driver who has been charged for any offense relating to rash and negligent driving.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of presenting evidence and conducting inquiries before terminating an employee's services. In the first case, the court found that the evidence presented by the company was more convincing, while in the second case, the court allowed the management to lead evidence to support their decision. In the third case, the court found the charges against the workman to be true but also ordered compensation for falsely claiming that he had resigned. These cases serve as reminders for companies to follow proper procedures and provide legitimate evidence when terminating an employee's services.
