The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s. Park CETP (P) Limited under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and direct them to give consent to establish and operate an ETP, R.O. plant, etc. in common to the petitioner CETP. The TNPCB had rejected the petitioner's application and insisted that they establish a combined ETP and not a common ETP.

The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that it was premature, as the petitioner had not filed a fresh application as requested by the TNPCB. The court held that it was for the TNPCB to satisfy itself whether all the statutory requirements and provisions of various environmental laws were complied with before passing an order.

The court order relates to W.P.No.26374 of 2008 and M.P.Nos.1 & 2 of 2008, and involves the District Environmental Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in Kumaran Complex, Tiruppur. The date of the order is 20-04-2008.

In essence, the court order deals with the issue of whether the TNPCB was justified in rejecting the petitioner's application for consent to establish and operate an ETP, R.O. plant, etc. in common to the petitioner CETP. The petitioner had argued that a common ETP would be more efficient and cost-effective than a combined ETP, which was insisted upon by the TNPCB.

However, the court held that the petitioner's writ petition was premature, as they had not filed a fresh application as requested by the TNPCB. The court emphasized that it was for the TNPCB to satisfy itself whether all the statutory requirements and provisions of various environmental laws were complied with before passing an order.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with statutory requirements and provisions of environmental laws. It also underscores the need for petitioners to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court for relief.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder that environmental protection is a crucial aspect of sustainable development, and that all stakeholders must work together to ensure that environmental laws and regulations are followed in letter and spirit.
