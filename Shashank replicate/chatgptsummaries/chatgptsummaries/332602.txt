The Karnataka High Court recently received petitions from accused individuals seeking to quash proceedings against them for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had lodged complaints against the accused for illegally establishing and operating an Iron Ore Stack Yard without the Board's consent and without providing pollution control measures. The accused argued that the Iron Ore Stack Yard did not fall under the definition of an industrial plant and that the State Board had not fixed emission standards. However, the court ruled that the Iron Ore Stack Yard was an industrial plant and that the State Board was bound by the emission standards set by the Central Board. The court also found that the accused had violated the provisions of the Air Act and allowed the proceedings to continue.

The court order also notified the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under Section 16(2)(h) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The standards include limits for pollutants such as Sulphur Dioxide, Oxides of Nitrogen, Suspended Particulate Matter, Lead, and Carbon Monoxide. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had lodged a complaint against 17 occupiers of Iron Ore Stack Yards for violating the provisions of the Air Act. The Chairman of the State Board authorized the Regional Officer to initiate legal action against the petitioners. The court dismissed the petitions and upheld the complaint lodged by the State Board represented by the Regional Officer. The court also stated that the matters are still at the initial stage, and the petitioners can argue on the merits of the case in the trial court.

The court has dismissed the petitions as they are not fit for quashing the proceedings. The matters are still at an initial stage, and the petitioners have been issued notices to appear before the court. The court acknowledges the assistance of the learned amicus curiae.
