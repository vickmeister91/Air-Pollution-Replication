The court order in question pertains to a case where a quarry owner was denied the renewal of his license to quarry in an area near Bhimbandh in Munger district, Bihar. The petitioner argued that he should not be denied the renewal of his license, even after ten years. However, the court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and preserving ecological balance, stating that the obligation to do so is a fundamental duty of every citizen of India.

The court cited several decisions of the Supreme Court that emphasized the need to preserve bio-diversity and protect the environment. The court noted that the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 cannot be seen in isolation and that the obligation to protect the environment is not a platitude. The court also observed that the petitioner had not complied with the conditions of the license and had caused damage to the environment.

The court emphasized that the environment is a precious resource that needs to be protected for the benefit of future generations. The court noted that the quarrying activity had caused damage to the environment and had affected the ecological balance of the area. The court also observed that the petitioner had not taken any steps to mitigate the damage caused by the quarrying activity.

The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for the renewal of his license and that the denial of the renewal was justified. The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the conditions of the license when it was granted to him and that he could not now seek to challenge those conditions.

The court emphasized that the obligation to protect the environment is a fundamental duty of every citizen of India and that it is the duty of the state to ensure that this obligation is fulfilled. The court noted that the state has a duty to protect the environment and that it cannot abdicate this duty.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for the grant of any relief and that the writ petition was devoid of merit. The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition.

In conclusion, the court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preserving ecological balance. The court notes that the obligation to protect the environment is a fundamental duty of every citizen of India and that it is the duty of the state to ensure that this obligation is fulfilled. The court also observes that the petitioner had not complied with the conditions of the license and had caused damage to the environment. The court, therefore, dismisses the writ petition and upholds the denial of the renewal of the petitioner's license.
