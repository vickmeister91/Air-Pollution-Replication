The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, but the court found the prosecution's evidence to be sufficient and convicted the accused. The relevant provisions of the Act were also discussed during the trial.

The second court order discusses the punishment for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, which includes imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to 25,000 rupees. The case in question involves the possession and sale of brushes made from mongoose hairs, which is a protected species. The accused, who was a dealer in such brushes, was found guilty of violating Section 49 of the Act and was convicted under Section 51. The court found the prosecution's case to be well-proven, and the accused failed to provide any explanation for his possession and sale of the brushes.

The prosecution presented a strong case against the accused, and the court found the evidence to be well-proven. The accused failed to provide any explanation for his possession and sale of the brushes, which further strengthened the prosecution's case.

The court also discussed the punishment for violating the Act, which includes imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to 25,000 rupees. The court noted that the Act was enacted to protect wildlife and their habitats, and that violations of its provisions are taken seriously.
