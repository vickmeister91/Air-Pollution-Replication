The court order pertains to four civil writ petitions filed by stone crusher units in Himachal Pradesh. These petitions challenged the order issued by the State Pollution Control Board in compliance with the National Green Tribunal's order. The NGT order was challenged by some of the stone crusher units and the state government in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court disposed of the case on January 7, 2019, granting the petitioners three months to move the tribunal for review or modification of the order.

In order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, the court extended the same protection to the petitioners and disposed of the writ petitions accordingly. The details of the NGT order that was being challenged by the stone crusher units and the state government are not provided.

It is important to note that the court order is related to environmental concerns and the impact of stone crusher units on the environment. The State Pollution Control Board had issued an order in compliance with the NGT order to regulate the functioning of these units and ensure that they comply with environmental norms.

The fact that the Supreme Court granted the petitioners three months to move the tribunal for review or modification of the NGT order indicates that the court is willing to consider the concerns of the stone crusher units and the state government. However, it is also important to ensure that environmental concerns are not compromised in the process.

Overall, the court order highlights the need for a balance between economic development and environmental protection. It is important for industries to comply with environmental norms and regulations to ensure sustainable development. At the same time, it is also important for the government to consider the concerns of industries and provide them with a fair opportunity to voice their concerns and seek redressal.
