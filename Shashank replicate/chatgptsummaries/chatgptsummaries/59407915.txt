Two court orders have been presented in this prompt, both of which deal with the issue of industrial relocation in Delhi. The first case involves a plaintiff named Surender Singh who filed a suit against the Government of NCT Delhi and the Managing Director of D.S.I.I.D.C. Ltd. for not allotting him an industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries. Singh had been running a business of manufacturing cables since 1995 and had applied for the allotment of a plot under the relocation scheme. However, his application was rejected on the grounds of his business being operated in a local commercial area. Singh argued that he fulfilled all the eligibility criteria for the allotment of a plot and was entitled to a mandatory injunction. The court decreed in favor of Singh, stating that he was eligible for the plot and that the defendants had acted arbitrarily in rejecting his application. The court ordered the defendants to allot a plot to Singh within a period of six months.

The second court order, titled M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India, addressed the issue of pollution in Delhi caused by industries in non-confirming areas. The plaintiff, M.C. Mehta, who ran a manufacturing business in a non-confirming area, had applied for an alternate industrial plot under a relocation scheme but was rejected by the defendants. The court found that Mehta was eligible for the plot and ordered the defendants to relocate Mehta's unit to a confirming zone. The defendants were also directed to act in a fair and impartial manner and to provide a mechanism for the allotment of plots. Mehta was awarded costs.

Both court orders deal with the issue of industrial relocation in Delhi and highlight the importance of fair and impartial decision-making by the authorities responsible for allotting industrial plots. The court orders also emphasize the need to address the issue of pollution caused by industries in non-confirming areas and to relocate such industries to confirming zones. The court orders provide relief to the plaintiffs who had been denied the allotment of industrial plots despite fulfilling the eligibility criteria. The court orders also serve as a reminder to the authorities responsible for industrial relocation to act in a fair and impartial manner and to provide a mechanism for the allotment of plots.
