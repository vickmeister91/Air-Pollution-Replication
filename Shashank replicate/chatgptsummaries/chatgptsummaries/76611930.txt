The court recently heard two revisions against an order that partly allowed an application filed by the accused. The accused had sought to summon the attendance register and CCTV footage of a bank to prove her innocence. The trial court rejected the prayer of summoning the CCTV footage but allowed the accused to place the attendance register on the record. The issue examined was whether the court can look into the defense material or whether the record can be summoned at the instance of the defense at the stage of framing of charge.

The court referred to previous judgments and ultimately held that the accused has no right to produce any material or ask the court to summon any record at the stage of framing of charge. The court order discusses various cases and their rulings regarding the rights of the accused to produce material at the stage of framing charges. It is held that ordinarily, defense material cannot be looked into by the court while framing charges, but in rare cases where the defense material convincingly demonstrates that the prosecution version is absurd or concocted, it can be looked into.

The court also states that the accused have no right to produce any document and that the trial court should not hold a mini-trial at this stage. The order sets aside the trial court's decision to allow the accused to place the attendance register on record and dismisses one of the petitions while allowing the other. The trial court is directed to proceed with the trial expeditiously.
