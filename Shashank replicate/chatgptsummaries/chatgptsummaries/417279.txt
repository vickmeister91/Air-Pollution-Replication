The High Court of Judicature at Madras recently issued a court order pertaining to multiple writ petitions and a writ appeal. The main issue at hand was the applicability of the Coastal Regulatory Zone Notification and whether it could be invoked for regulating any activity that is not concerned with industrial activity. The court also considered the maintainability of the writ petition filed by the Member Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, challenging the Notification dated 22.4.2003 issued by the Secretary to Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The court expressed strong doubt regarding the maintainability of the writ petition but allowed it to be withdrawn as per the petitioner's request. The court order also discussed the relevant provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991, and concluded that the provisions are applicable to all activities, including construction of buildings for residential purposes, and not just industrial activities.

The court clarified that all activities are prohibited in CRZ-1 and in CRZ-2, activities like construction of residential buildings can be prohibited if the provisions contained in the Act, the Rules or the CRZ Notifications are contravened. The court also noted that the decision to demolish a college and construct a secretariat on the land in question has become academic.

The court order also stated that the activities prohibited/regulated do not only relate to industrial activities but also to construction activities for residential purposes. The specific prayers made in two petitions regarding the demolition of Queen Mary's College have abated due to a change in the scenario, and the petitions are disposed of.

The court listed several government officials and departments as respondents. The court expressed doubt about the authority of the statutory body to file such a petition and dismissed it as withdrawn. The order also discussed the maintainability of a writ petition filed by the Member-Secretary of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority challenging the validity of a notification issued by the Central Government.
