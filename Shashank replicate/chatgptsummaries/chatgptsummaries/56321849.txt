The All India Cotton Seeds Crushers' Association filed a petition requesting the court to issue a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to derequisition the premises owned by them. The subject property was given on leave and license basis by the petitioner to the Maharashtra State Farming Corporation Limited. The Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation Limited was allotted the premises for office purposes, and the compensation determined was required to be paid by the allottee to Respondent No. 2 on a monthly basis. The petitioners claimed derequisitioning of the premises and for direction to hand over the possession. The parties reached an agreement, and the matter was settled. The Federation agreed to pay Rs. 16,000/- per month as compensation plus Rs. 1,400/- or such.

The court order states that the Federation must pay the Association a monthly compensation of Rs. 16,000 plus maintenance charges for the use of certain premises. The Federation must also hand over possession of the premises to the Association when it is no longer needed. The Association must withdraw a writ petition filed in the High Court. The petitioners argue that the agreement does not establish privity between them and the landlord and tenant, and that the grounds for the original order of requisition are not foreclosed by the withdrawal of the writ petition or the agreement. The State Government has proposed derequisitioning the premises, but the Petitioners object to the pre-condition of accepting Respondent No. 3 as a tenant. The agreement does not refer to Respondent No. 3 as a tenant, but rather as paying compensation per month.

The court order discusses the Bombay Land Requisition Act, 1948 and its provisions related to landlords, requisition of land, and compensation. The court also notes that the agreement between the parties does not refer to the respondent as a tenant, but rather as someone who pays compensation per month. The court ultimately concludes that the respondent must vacate the premises within one month of receiving the order.

The court order discusses various amendments made to the Bombay Land Requisition Act, 1948 and the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. It notes that the power of the State Government or authorities to direct the 'requiring to let' the premises has been deleted in the year 1952. The order also mentions the addition of Section 15B to the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 and the definition of "Government Allottee" in Section 5(1)(a) of the same Act. The Petitioners argue that these amendments do not confirm the status of a tenant on Respondent No. 3.

The court order states that the respondent cannot be considered a tenant as per the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act and the Bombay Land Requisition Act. The state government can claim tenancy for non-residential premises, and for residential premises allotted by the government, the person allowed to remain in occupation becomes the tenant. The petitioner argues that the controller of accommodation or the state government cannot direct them to accept the respondent as a tenant. The state government has already decided to de-requisition the premises, and the order directing de-requisitioning of premises needs to be issued. The court refers to a previous case where an order of requisitioning property cannot continue for an unreasonably long period and must be revoked.

The court order distinguishes between compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of property, stating that acquisition involves the transfer of ownership while requisitioning involves temporary control without acquiring ownership. The government cannot use requisitioning to acquire property for an indefinite period of time, as this would be a fraud on the power conferred on the government. The order of requisitioning in this case, which had been in effect for 30 years, was deemed invalid and the government was ordered to revoke it and evict the appellant from the property. The appellant's argument that he became a direct tenant by paying rent to the original owner was rejected.

The court order discusses the concept of requisition and acquisition of property. It states that a requisition order cannot continue indefinitely and must be for a reasonable period of time. The order of requisition in this case has been in effect for 44 years, which is considered unreasonable. The court directs the State Government to derequisition the premises and place the petitioners in vacant possession of the flat within three months. The court also states that the imposition of conditions outside the purview of the law cannot be upheld.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article pertain to disputes over the requisitioning and use of certain premises. The All India Cotton Seeds Crushers' Association filed a petition requesting the court to issue a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to derequisition the premises owned by them. The parties reached an agreement, and the Federation agreed to pay compensation for the use of the premises. The court order discusses various amendments made to the Bombay Land Requisition Act, 1948 and the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. The court ultimately concludes that the respondent must vacate the premises within one month of receiving the order. The court also distinguishes between compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of property, stating that requisitioning cannot continue indefinitely and must be for a reasonable period of time.
