The Karnataka High Court recently quashed the proceedings in C.C.No.285/2007 pending on Chikkanayakanahalli, filed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board against M/s Noor Enterprises and Sri. H. Noor Ahmed. The complaint alleged that the petitioners had a license to carry Metric Tones and in case if they exceed the quantity, they have to approach for permission as required under Section 21 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court allowed the petitioners' plea, stating that there was no prima facie case made out by the complainant.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the complainant had failed to provide any evidence to support their allegations. The court noted that the complainant had not produced any documents to show that the petitioners had exceeded the quantity of Metric Tones they were licensed to carry. The court also observed that the complainant had not provided any evidence to show that the petitioners had failed to obtain permission as required under Section 21 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court further noted that the complainant had not provided any evidence to show that the petitioners had caused any pollution or environmental damage. The court observed that the complainant had merely made vague and general allegations without providing any specific details or evidence to support their claims.

In light of these facts, the court concluded that there was no prima facie case made out by the complainant. The court therefore quashed the proceedings in C.C.No.285/2007 pending on Chikkanayakanahalli, filed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board against M/s Noor Enterprises and Sri. H. Noor Ahmed.

However, the court also reserved the liberty to the complainant to proceed against the petitioner if there is a violation. This means that if the complainant is able to provide evidence to support their allegations in the future, they may be able to file a new complaint against the petitioners.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing specific and detailed evidence to support allegations of pollution or environmental damage. Vague and general allegations are unlikely to be sufficient to establish a prima facie case in court.
