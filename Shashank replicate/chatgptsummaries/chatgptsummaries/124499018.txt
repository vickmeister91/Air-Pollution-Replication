The court order in question pertains to a case between Naved Kamran and several defendants, including Shakeel Ahmed, Jamil Ahmed, Laeeq Ahmed, Delhi Development Authority, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, and Mohd. Akram. The plaintiff sought a decree against the defendants in respect of the prayer (ii) of the plaint on the basis of admissions made by the defendants in their written statement. However, the defendants opposed the application, stating that the relief under Order XII Rule 6 CPC is discretionary relief and the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought as a matter of right.

The court ultimately dismissed the application, stating that there were no clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal admissions made by the defendants. Additionally, the court did not have jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit as the Central Pollution Control Board/State Pollution Control Board/Appellate Authorities constituted under the Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 have jurisdiction.

The case at hand appears to involve a dispute over pollution control and environmental regulations. The plaintiff sought relief based on admissions made by the defendants in their written statement, but the court ultimately found that these admissions were not clear or unambiguous enough to warrant the relief sought. Additionally, the court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, as other bodies have been established to handle matters related to pollution control and environmental regulation.

It is worth noting that the court's decision to dismiss the application was based on specific legal grounds, rather than the merits of the case itself. The court did not make any determinations regarding the actual pollution or environmental issues at hand, but rather focused on whether the plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought and whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework surrounding environmental regulation and pollution control. It also underscores the need for clear and unambiguous admissions in legal proceedings, as these can be crucial in determining the outcome of a case.
