The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against orders passed by the VIIIth Additional Sessions Judge in Gwalior in S.T.No.211/2015. The petitioner sought to challenge the validity and propriety of an order dated 27.05.2016, which allowed an application filed under Section 311 of CrPC seeking permission to recall a witness and prove certain documents that came into existence after the filing of the charge sheet.

The petitioner argued that the Trial Court had erred in allowing the application under Section 311 of CrPC, as the documents in question were not admissible under the Indian Evidence Act. The petitioner further contended that the Trial Court had failed to consider the relevance and materiality of the documents before allowing the application.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court set aside the order allowing the application under Section 311 of CrPC and directed the Trial Court to decide the application afresh. The court held that the Trial Court had failed to consider whether the documents in question could be taken into consideration or not, and that this was a crucial factor in determining the admissibility of the documents.

The court further observed that the Trial Court had not considered the relevance and materiality of the documents before allowing the application under Section 311 of CrPC. The court held that the Trial Court must consider these factors before allowing any application under Section 311 of CrPC.

The court also noted that the Trial Court had not considered the prejudice that may be caused to the accused by allowing the application under Section 311 of CrPC. The court held that the Trial Court must consider this factor as well before allowing any application under Section 311 of CrPC.

In conclusion, the court set aside the order allowing the application under Section 311 of CrPC and directed the Trial Court to decide the application afresh after considering whether the documents can be taken into consideration or not. The court also directed the Trial Court to consider the relevance and materiality of the documents, as well as the prejudice that may be caused to the accused, before allowing any application under Section 311 of CrPC.
