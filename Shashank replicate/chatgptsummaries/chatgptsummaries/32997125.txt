The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by A. Sahira Banu against various government officials regarding the rejection of her request for renewal of building license and plan permission. The petitioner had constructed a commercial building instead of a residential one, which was in violation of the master plan. The court found that the petitioner cannot flout planning norms and demand to keep the building intact. However, the court allowed the petitioner to submit a fresh application to the concerned authority, subject to compliance with the new master plan and building norms.

The court has ordered the petitioner to make a fresh application to the concerned authority within three weeks, and the application will be disposed of within six months. The impugned proceedings will be kept in abeyance until then. The petitioner's building must conform to planning norms, and the authorities must conduct spot inspections and issue fresh proceedings. If the authorities fail to ensure conformity, they will be liable to be proceeded against. The writ petition is disposed of with no costs.
