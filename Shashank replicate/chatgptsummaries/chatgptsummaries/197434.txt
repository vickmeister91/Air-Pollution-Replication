The court order pertains to a case where the Goa Foundation challenged the construction of a beach resort by Diksha Holdings Pvt. Ltd. in Nagorcem Beach, Palolem, Taluka Cancona, Goa. The foundation argued that the construction violated the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification and would lead to environmental degradation. The court examined the CRZ norms and noted that while CRZ-I prohibits any new construction within 500 meters of the High Tide Line, CRZ-III permits construction of hotels with prior approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The court also discussed the nature of sand and sand dunes and their formation by wind and water. The court noted that sand dunes are an important part of the coastal ecosystem and play a crucial role in protecting the coast from erosion and storm surges. The court also noted that sand dunes are fragile and can be easily damaged by human activities.

The court then considered the evidence presented by both parties, including a report from the National Institute of Oceanography. The court noted that the report found that the proposed construction project would not cause any permanent or temporary environmental degradation. The court also noted that the project had obtained all the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities.

The court then considered the issue of balancing development and ecology in the context of the proposed construction project. The court noted that economic development is important for the country, but it must be balanced with environmental protection. The court noted that the project would generate employment and revenue for the state, but it must be carried out in a manner that does not harm the environment.

Ultimately, the court upheld the construction of the beach resort subject to compliance with the CRZ norms and environmental regulations. The court directed the project proponent to take all necessary measures to protect the sand dunes and the coastal ecosystem. The court also directed the project proponent to obtain all necessary clearances from the relevant authorities before commencing construction.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. The court recognized the importance of sand dunes in protecting the coast from erosion and storm surges and directed the project proponent to take all necessary measures to protect them. The court also emphasized the need for compliance with environmental regulations and obtaining all necessary clearances from the relevant authorities before commencing construction.
