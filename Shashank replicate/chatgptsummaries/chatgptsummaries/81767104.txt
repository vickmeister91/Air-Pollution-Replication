The Madras High Court recently heard appeals by M/s.DXN Herbal Manufacturing (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai C Bench, for the Assessment Years 2003-2004 & 2004-2005. The assessee claimed a deduction under Section 80IB of the Income Tax Act, which was disallowed by the Assessing Officer on the grounds that the petitioner was not engaged in any manufacturing activity. The Tribunal concurred with the views expressed by the Assessing Officer and CIT(A) and dismissed the appeals.

The High Court considered whether the Tribunal was right in holding that the assessee was not entitled to claim deduction under Section 80IB and found that the Tribunal's decision was based on personal opinion and not borne out by any records. The Court also noted that the word "manufacture" was not defined under the Act at that relevant time and referred to a recent judgment in a similar case. The Court held that the assessee was entitled to claim deduction under Section 80IB as it was engaged in manufacturing activity.

The court order discusses two issues. The first issue is whether a company engaged in bottling LPG cylinders for domestic use is entitled to claim tax benefits under certain sections of the Income Tax Act, which depend on whether the activity amounts to production or manufacturing. The court held that the activity does amount to processing and therefore qualifies for the tax benefits. The second issue is whether a company can claim a deduction under Section 43B for excise duty paid, even if it was not claimed as an expenditure in the books of accounts. The court held that as long as the payment was made, the deduction should be allowed. The court also found that the company was engaged in manufacturing and therefore entitled to the deduction.

The court order states that Question No.1 is in favor of the assessee and against the Revenue. Question No.2 is also in favor of the assessee as the ITAT was wrong in denying the claim under Section 43B. However, Question No.3 is in favor of the Revenue as the violation of principles of natural justice did not result in injury to the appellant. The tax case appeals are allowed in part with no costs.

In summary, the Madras High Court allowed the appeals by M/s.DXN Herbal Manufacturing (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai C Bench, for the Assessment Years 2003-2004 & 2004-2005. The Court held that the assessee was entitled to claim deduction under Section 80IB as it was engaged in manufacturing activity. The Court also held that a company engaged in bottling LPG cylinders for domestic use is entitled to claim tax benefits under certain sections of the Income Tax Act, which depend on whether the activity amounts to production or manufacturing. The Court further held that a company can claim a deduction under Section 43B for excise duty paid, even if it was not claimed as an expenditure in the books of accounts. However, the Court found that the violation of principles of natural justice did not result in injury to the appellant and therefore Question No.3 was in favor of the Revenue.
