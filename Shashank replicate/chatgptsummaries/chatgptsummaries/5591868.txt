The court order pertains to multiple appeals against a common order passed by the City Civil Judge in Mumbai. The judge had held that the plaint in a suit was bound to be rejected as pre-suit statutory notices required under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act were not issued and served upon the public authorities. The court emphasizes that waiver of pre-suit statutory notice is contrary to law and cannot be waived by contract. The mandate of law contained in Section 527 of the MMC Act against institution of suit requires obedience by prospective plaintiffs.

The suit pertained to the redevelopment of a chawl in Mumbai, and the plaintiffs had entered into an agreement with the developer for the same. The court order provides details of the agreement and the events leading up to the suit. The court discusses the requirement of pre-suit statutory notice under Section 527 of the MMC Act and Section 164 of the MCS Act, 1960.

The court order states that prospective plaintiffs must obey the requirements of issuing and serving pre-suit statutory notices, as it serves a public purpose.

The plaintiffs were entitled to an accommodation in the newly constructed building facing Dr. Anandrao Naik Road in lieu of the old premises.
