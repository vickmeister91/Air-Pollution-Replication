In this case, Purba Ram was arrested for allegedly killing a deer, which is a protected animal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence presented, and the accused's criminal record.

The court considered the nature of the offense and the fact that the accused was charged with a non-bailable offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court also considered the evidence presented before it, which included the testimony of three witnesses who saw the petitioner killing the deer. However, the court also considered the petitioner's claim that the deer got entangled in the wire and died, and he informed the Forest Department. The court had to weigh the evidence presented and decide whether the accused was likely to be convicted or not.

The court also considered the accused's criminal record and whether he was likely to flee or tamper with evidence if released on bail. The court ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each for his appearance before the court on all hearing dates. This was done to ensure that the accused would appear before the court on all hearing dates and not flee or tamper with evidence.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Purba Ram was based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence presented, and the accused's criminal record. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each for his appearance before the court on all hearing dates. The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the evidence presented and the accused's likelihood of being convicted.
