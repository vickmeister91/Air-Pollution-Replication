The case in question involves the alleged commission of a crime under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The applicant, Govind Lal Sulake, had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, which empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.
