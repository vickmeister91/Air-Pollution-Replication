The Karnataka High Court has heard a case (W.P.No.36789/2014) brought by M. Veerabhadraiah against various parties including the Union of India, the State of Karnataka, the Bar Council of India, and several individual advocates. The details of the case are not provided in the given text. The court order was issued on December 18, 2015, and was presided over by Acting Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and Justice B.V. Nagarathna.

The court order lists the names and addresses of various advocates and respondents involved in a writ petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The petition seeks to quash two notifications issued by the third respondent and declare them not in consonance with Section 16(2) of the Advocates Act 1961. The petitioner is an advocate named T.N. Raghupathy, and the respondents include the High Court of Karnataka, various other advocates, and the Union of India. The order also mentions the names of the advocates representing each respondent.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, challenging the designation of certain advocates as senior advocates under Section 16 of the Advocates Act, 1961. The petitioners argue that no rules have been framed for the exercise of power under Section 16(2) of the Act, and that the designation of the advocates in question was done hastily and without finalizing the Draft Rules, 2014. The court has reserved judgment on the matter. The order also includes a quote about the profession of law and the two aspects it entails.

The court order discusses a petition filed against the designation of certain advocates as senior advocates without finalizing the Draft Rules. The petitioners argue that some of the designated advocates were ineligible and that there was favoritism, nepotism, discrimination, unfairness, non-transparency, and monopoly in the decision-making process. The Registrar General of the High Court of Karnataka argues that the process adopted by the Court is in consonance with the Norms fixed by the Court under sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Advocates' Act, 1961. The court order also mentions the Norms fixed by the High Court of Karnataka for designating an advocate as a senior advocate and the process of designation by secret ballot. The court order concludes that the matter requires further consideration and directs the constitution of a larger bench to decide the issues raised in the petitions.

The court order discusses the process of designating advocates as senior advocates in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Act. The court has fixed norms for this process, including sponsorship by an advocate or senior advocate. The court designated four advocates as senior advocates by secret ballot, and later designated more advocates based on sponsorship and secret ballot. The court denies any illegality in the process and argues that the designations were made in accordance with the criteria mentioned in Section 16(2) of the Act. The court also denies allegations of nepotism and favoritism and argues that the process of secret ballot is fair and transparent. The court dismisses the writ petitions challenging the designations.

The court order discusses the designation of senior advocates and the process used by the court to select them. The court criticizes the use of secret ballot and the lack of transparency in the selection process, which has led to speculation and "horse trading." The court also notes that some advocates have been designated without satisfying the eligibility criteria. The court suggests that a transparent system of designation should be adopted and that the practice of advocates filing applications seeking designation should be discontinued. The court also suggests that the designation of senior advocates should be on recommendation of the judges and by the decision of the Full Court.

The court order discusses a dispute over the designation of senior advocates in the High Court. One side argues that the method of secret ballot used to designate senior advocates is flawed and that the Full Court proceedings should be examined. They also argue that the procedure for applications for senior advocate designation is incorrect. The other side argues that the Full Court acted in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Act and that the prevalent norms were applied. The court must consider whether the designation of senior advocates was legal and whether the court had the jurisdiction to make such designations without rules or regulations being in place.

The court order pertains to the designation of advocates as senior advocates in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Act. The court discusses the existing norms fixed by the High Court of Karnataka and the criteria for designation as a senior advocate. The court also addresses the petitioner's contention that in the absence of rules being framed under Section 16(2) of the Act, the court had no power to designate advocates as senior advocates. The court ultimately concludes that even in the absence of rules, the court can exercise power under Section 16(2) of the Act.

The court order discusses a case related to the power of the State Government to declare an area as an air pollution control area without rules prescribing the manner for declaration. The court held that non-framing of rules does not curtail the power of the State Government. The order also discusses various judicial precedents related to the exercise of power under a provision of a statute and the framing of rules. The court concludes that the prevalent norms have been applied in
