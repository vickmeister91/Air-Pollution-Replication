The case of George Thomas revolves around the ownership and transportation of a captive elephant. Thomas, the petitioner, is the owner of the elephant and had sought permission to transport it to Gujarat. However, the State of Kerala had issued an order (Ext.P7) directing him to return the elephant to its original owner. Thomas filed a writ petition seeking to quash this order, claiming that it was based on a misinterpretation of section 40(2) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

Section 40(2) of the Act states that no person shall transfer, assign or sell any captive animal specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV, except with the previous permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden. The State of Kerala had interpreted this provision to mean that Thomas could not transport the elephant to Gujarat without the permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden. However, Thomas argued that the provision only applied to the transfer, assignment or sale of captive animals and did not restrict their movement.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and examined the relevant provisions of the Act. The court noted that the Act was enacted to provide for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The court observed that the Act had a dual purpose – to protect wildlife and to regulate trade in wildlife. The court also noted that the Act had a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of captive animals, including provisions for their registration, housing, care and transportation.

The court then examined the specific provision in question – section 40(2) – and noted that it applied to the transfer, assignment or sale of captive animals specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV. The court observed that the elephant in question was not specified in any of these schedules and therefore, section 40(2) did not apply to it. The court also noted that the Act did not contain any provision restricting the movement of captive animals, except in certain circumstances such as for their protection or for scientific research.

Based on these observations, the court held that the State of Kerala had misinterpreted section 40(2) of the Act and that the order directing Thomas to return the elephant was without legal basis. The court quashed the order and directed the State of Kerala to allow Thomas to transport the elephant to Gujarat, subject to compliance with any other applicable laws or regulations.

In addition to the writ of certiorari and mandamus sought by Thomas, the court also issued any other appropriate orders deemed fit by the court. This was to ensure that Thomas was not subjected to any further harassment or inconvenience in the transportation of the elephant.

In conclusion, the case of George Thomas highlights the importance of a proper interpretation of the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act has a comprehensive scheme for the protection and regulation of wildlife, including captive animals. It is important for all stakeholders to understand the provisions of the Act and to comply with them in order to ensure the proper protection and conservation of wildlife.
