The court order pertains to three writ petitions filed by individuals seeking to quash an order by the Deputy Commissioner to delete their names from revenue records or interfere with their property rights in respect of land in question. The petitioners claimed to have purchased the land legally from the original grantee, but the Deputy Commissioner rejected their claim on the grounds that the land was forest land and no grant was made. The court held that the Deputy Commissioner erred in rejecting the claim of the petitioners without examining all relevant records and documents. The court emphasized that property rights are constitutional and human rights and must be protected.

The court order states that the Deputy Commissioner must handle precious rights with care. The Constitution of India provides for the right to live, which includes food, shelter, and land. The right to land is important for livelihood, and the court has come across cases where the grantee's rights were denied due to the unavailability of documents. The case is remitted back to the Deputy Commissioner to pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law. The Deputy Commissioner must examine whether the land has been granted permanently and whether the petitioners belong to SC/ST. The impugned orders passed by the 2nd respondent are quashed, and the writ petitions are disposed of.
