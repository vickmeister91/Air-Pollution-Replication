In a recent court order, three individuals had filed a bail application in a case related to hunting a wild animal and consuming its meat. However, one of the petitioners withdrew their application, leaving the other two to face the court. The court granted bail to the remaining two individuals on the grounds that their role in the incident was limited to consuming the meat and there was no evidence of their participation in the hunting.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the two individuals had not been directly involved in the hunting of the wild animal. Instead, they had only consumed the meat that had been obtained by others. The court also noted that there was no evidence to suggest that the two individuals had encouraged or aided in the hunting of the animal.

As a result, the court directed the two individuals to furnish a personal bond and surety for their appearance in court. This was done to ensure that they would appear in court for future proceedings related to the case. The court also imposed certain conditions on the two individuals, such as not leaving the country without prior permission from the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of evidence in determining guilt or innocence. In this case, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the two individuals had participated in the hunting of the wild animal. As a result, they were granted bail and allowed to go free until their next court appearance.

It is worth noting that hunting wild animals is illegal in many parts of the world, including India where this case took place. The consumption of wild animal meat is also illegal in many places, as it can pose a risk to human health. The court's decision in this case sends a message that such activities will not be tolerated and that those who engage in them will be held accountable.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the evidence presented. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the two individuals had participated in the hunting of the wild animal and that their role was limited to consuming the meat. As a result, they were granted bail and allowed to go free until their next court appearance.
