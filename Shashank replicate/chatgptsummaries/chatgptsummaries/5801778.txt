The court order in question pertains to a trial under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in S.T.No.777/2015, which is currently pending before the Session Court in Jabalpur. The accused in the case had filed two separate applications under Section 91 and 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C), requesting that the statements of Sushila Bai (the deceased), Rammi Bai, Sukhchain, and Rakesh Kori recorded at the time of the merger enquest be called, as well as the treatment papers of the deceased from the medical college in Jabalpur.

The learned Session Judge allowed the application under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C, which pertained to the calling of the statements of the witnesses. However, the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C was disallowed. The petitioner had requested the treatment papers of the deceased, claiming that they were relevant to the case. The court allowed the petition and directed that the treatment paper or bed head ticket of the deceased Sushila Bai be called from the Medical College in Jabalpur.

Section 306 of the IPC deals with abetment of suicide. The accused in this case had allegedly abetted the suicide of Sushila Bai. The trial was ongoing, and the accused had filed the two applications in question to request the calling of certain evidence. The first application was filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, which deals with the production of documents or other things that are necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code. The second application was filed under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C, which deals with the power of the court to summon material witnesses, or examine a person present in court, or recall and re-examine any person already examined.

The court allowed the application under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C, which pertained to the calling of the statements of the witnesses. This means that the court agreed that the statements of Rammi Bai, Sukhchain, and Rakesh Kori recorded at the time of the merger enquest were relevant to the case and should be called. However, the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C was disallowed. This means that the court did not agree that the treatment papers of the deceased were necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial.

The petitioner had claimed that the treatment papers of the deceased were relevant to the case. The court agreed with this claim and allowed the petition. The court directed that the treatment paper or bed head ticket of the deceased Sushila Bai be called from the Medical College in Jabalpur. This means that the court ordered the medical college to produce the treatment papers of the deceased, which would then be used as evidence in the trial.

In summary, the court order in question pertains to a trial under Section 306 of the IPC in S.T.No.777/2015 pending before the Session Court in Jabalpur. The accused had filed two separate applications under Section 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C, requesting the calling of certain evidence.
