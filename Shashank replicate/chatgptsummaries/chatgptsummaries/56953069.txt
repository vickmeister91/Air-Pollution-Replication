The court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Surendra Kumar Arya and others against the dismissal of their application under Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. The applicants were facing trial for offences under Sections 420, 403, 406, 467, 477, 477-A, 120-B of IPC. They had filed an application to call for a departmental enquiry report and to add some accused persons in the case. The trial court had dismissed the application, and the applicants had relied on the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of "V.K. Sasikala Vs. State represented by Superintendent of Police" [(2012) 9 SCC 771].

The applicants had argued that the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of V.K. Sasikala (supra) should be applied in their case as well. However, the court held that the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of V.K. Sasikala (supra) cannot be applied in a case where defence document is called under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court also held that the application under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. was premature and dismissed the revision filed by the applicants.

The court directed the trial court to proceed with the case expeditiously. This means that the trial court will now have to proceed with the trial of the accused persons without any further delay. The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope and applicability of Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and the circumstances under which a departmental enquiry report can be called for in a criminal case.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to proceed against any person who is not an accused in a case but whose presence is necessary for the purpose of adjudicating upon any offence that has been committed.

In the present case, the applicants had filed an application under Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. to call for a departmental enquiry report and to add some accused persons in the case. The trial court had dismissed the application, and the applicants had challenged the dismissal of their application in a revision filed before the higher court.

The court, while dismissing the revision filed by the applicants, held that the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of V.K. Sasikala (supra) cannot be applied in a case where defence document is called under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court observed that the judgment in V.K. Sasikala's case was passed in a different context and cannot be applied in the present case.

The court also held that the application under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. was premature. The court observed that the trial court had not yet completed the trial of the accused persons, and therefore, it was premature to add any accused persons at this stage. The court held that the trial court should first complete the trial of the accused persons and then consider whether any other person needs to be added to the case.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope and applicability of Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and the circumstances under which a departmental enquiry report can be called for in a criminal case. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of completing the trial of the accused persons expeditiously and without any delay.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the present case clarifies the scope and applicability of Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and emphasizes the importance of completing the trial of the accused persons expeditiously. The court's decision is significant as it provides guidance to the trial courts on how to deal with applications filed under Section 91 read with Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and ensures that the trial of the accused persons is not delayed unnecessarily.
