This serves as a reminder that individuals must follow the correct legal procedures and provide adequate evidence to support their claims.

The other two applicants were granted bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one solvent surety each. This indicates that the court found them to be trustworthy and reliable enough to be released on bail. However, the court also imposed six conditions that the applicants must comply with, including cooperating in the trial and not committing any similar offenses.

The third condition requires the applicants to report to the police station on a regular basis. This is designed to ensure that the applicants do not flee or commit any further crimes while they are out on bail. The fourth condition requires the applicants to provide their contact details to the police and inform them of any change in their address or phone number. This is important as it ensures that the police can contact the applicants if necessary.

The fifth condition requires the applicants to not commit any similar offenses while they are out on bail. This is designed to prevent the applicants from committing any further crimes while they are awaiting trial.
