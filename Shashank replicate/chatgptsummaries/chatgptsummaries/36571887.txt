The court order in question pertains to an appeal against the ejectment of a tenant due to their failure to deposit rent within the stipulated period. The case was heard under Section 14-A of the Punjab Security of Land Tenure Act, which allows for eviction in the event of default by a tenant to deposit rent within the stipulated time. The court ultimately upheld the eviction and dismissed the appeal.

The case was initially heard by a learned Single Judge, who had ruled in favor of the landlord and ordered the eviction of the tenant. The tenant had then filed an appeal against this decision, arguing that the Single Judge had erred in their judgment.

However, upon hearing the appeal, the court found no legal infirmity in the Single Judge's decision and upheld the eviction. The court's decision was based on the fact that the tenant had failed to deposit rent within the stipulated time, as required by Section 14-A of the Punjab Security of Land Tenure Act.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with the terms of a lease agreement, particularly with regard to the timely payment of rent. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against the tenant, including eviction.

It is worth noting that the Punjab Security of Land Tenure Act is a piece of legislation that is designed to protect the rights of tenants in the state of Punjab. The act provides various protections for tenants, including the right to security of tenure and protection against arbitrary eviction.

However, the act also places certain obligations on tenants, such as the requirement to pay rent on time. Failure to comply with these obligations can result in legal action being taken against the tenant, as was the case in this instance.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with the terms of a lease agreement, particularly with regard to the timely payment of rent. Tenants who fail to do so may find themselves facing legal action, including eviction, under the provisions of the Punjab Security of Land Tenure Act.
