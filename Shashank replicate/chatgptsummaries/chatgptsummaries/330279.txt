The Gujarat High Court has recently allowed a Criminal Revision Application filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against Aegies Chemicals and two of its partners. The court quashed and set aside the order of discharge passed by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, and remanded the matter to the trial court to be disposed of on merits according to law. The court found the impugned order of discharge to be ex-facie perverse and illegal and directed the learned Magistrate to give topmost priority to the case and decide it preferably on or before 30th November 1995.

The case pertains to the alleged violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, by Aegies Chemicals and its partners. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused before the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, alleging that they had discharged untreated effluent and emitted noxious gases into the environment, causing pollution and environmental degradation.

The learned Magistrate had discharged the accused by an order dated 30th June 1995, holding that the complaint was not maintainable as the Gujarat Pollution Control Board had not obtained prior sanction from the State Government under Section 16 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The learned Magistrate had also held that the complaint was time-barred as it had been filed after the expiry of the limitation period prescribed under Section 15 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 24 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had challenged the order of discharge before the Gujarat High Court by filing a Criminal Revision Application. The Board had contended that the learned Magistrate had erred in holding that the complaint was not maintainable and time-barred. The Board had submitted that it was not required to obtain prior sanction from the State Government under Section 16 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, as it was a statutory body constituted under the said Acts. The Board had also submitted that the complaint was not time-barred as the limitation period prescribed under the said Acts was not applicable to it.

The Gujarat High Court, after hearing the parties and perusing the record, found merit in the contentions of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court held that the Board was not required to obtain prior sanction from the State Government under Section 16 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, as it was a statutory body constituted under the said Acts. The court also held that the complaint was not time-barred as the limitation period prescribed under the said Acts was not applicable to the Board.

The court further held that the learned Magistrate had erred in discharging the accused without considering the evidence on record and without giving an opportunity to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to lead evidence in support of its complaint. The court found the impugned order of discharge to be ex-facie perverse and illegal and directed the learned Magistrate to give topmost priority to the case and decide it preferably on or before 30th November 1995.

The decision of the Gujarat High Court is significant as it reaffirms the powers and functions of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board as a statutory body constituted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The decision also underscores the importance of protecting the environment and preventing pollution, which are essential for the health and well-being of the people and the sustainable development of the country. The decision is likely to have a deterrent effect on industries and individuals who violate the environmental laws and regulations and cause harm to the environment and the public health.
