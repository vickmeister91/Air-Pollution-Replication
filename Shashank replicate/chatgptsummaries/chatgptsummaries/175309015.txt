The Jharkhand High Court recently granted bail to Jakir Mian, who had been accused of running a stone crusher without a valid license and NOC. The petitioner was directed to be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate.

The case against Jakir Mian was that he had been running a stone crusher without a valid license and NOC. The authorities had issued a notice to him to stop the operation of the stone crusher, but he had continued to operate it. The authorities had then filed a complaint against him, and he was arrested.

Jakir Mian had filed a bail application before the Jharkhand High Court, which was heard by Justice Ananda Sen. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner had been falsely implicated in the case, and that he had not been given a fair chance to defend himself. The counsel also argued that the petitioner had been in custody for a long time, and that he was entitled to bail.

The prosecution opposed the bail application, arguing that the petitioner had committed a serious offence, and that he was likely to abscond if released on bail. The prosecution also argued that the petitioner had not cooperated with the investigation, and that he was likely to tamper with the evidence if released on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, the Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Jakir Mian. The court observed that the petitioner had been in custody for a long time, and that there was no likelihood of him absconding or tampering with the evidence. The court also observed that the petitioner had a right to defend himself, and that he should be given a fair chance to do so.

The court directed the petitioner to be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate. The court also directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation, and not to tamper with the evidence.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant bail to Jakir Mian is a welcome one. The court has rightly observed that the petitioner has a right to defend himself, and that he should be given a fair chance to do so. The court has also rightly observed that the petitioner has been in custody for a long time, and that he should be released on bail. The court's direction to the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence is also a welcome one, as it will ensure that justice is done in the case.
