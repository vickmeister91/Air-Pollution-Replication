The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has expressed concern that the delay in dealing with the matter may result in the destruction of documentary evidence and the accused may benefit.

In addition, the Transport Commissioners of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra have been directed to furnish information about the passage of HSD carrying tankers through the inter-State check posts during the period 1997 to 2000. This information is crucial to the investigation and will help the Investigating Officer to determine the extent of the scam and the involvement of various parties.

The State of Gujarat has also been directed to provide necessary assistance with regard to the matter touching the sales tax and the persons involved in the scam. This is to ensure that all relevant information related to the scam is made available to the Investigating Officer in a timely manner.
