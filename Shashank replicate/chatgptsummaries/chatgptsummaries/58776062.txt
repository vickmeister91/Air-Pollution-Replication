The Madras High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Raja and Fathima Babu, who had filed a petition seeking protection from police harassment in connection with the Anti Sterlite agitation. The court has directed the police not to harass the petitioners or other witnesses in the guise of exercising their power to enquire. The police have been instructed to conduct a comprehensive enquiry on the same day and not to call the petitioners again in connection with the Anti Sterlite occurrence.

The Anti Sterlite agitation was a protest against the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, which was accused of causing environmental pollution and health hazards to the local residents. The protest turned violent on May 22, 2018, when the police opened fire on the protesters, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The incident sparked widespread outrage and led to the closure of the Sterlite Copper plant.

Raja and Fathima Babu were among the prominent activists who had participated in the Anti Sterlite agitation. They had been vocal in their criticism of the Sterlite Copper plant and had demanded its closure. However, they had also been targeted by the police for their involvement in the protest. They had alleged that the police had been harassing them and other activists in an attempt to silence their voices.

In their petition, Raja and Fathima Babu had sought protection from police harassment and had requested the court to direct the police not to call them again in connection with the Anti Sterlite occurrence. They had also asked the court to order a comprehensive enquiry into the incident and to ensure that the witnesses were not harassed by the police.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners and directed the police not to harass them or other witnesses in the guise of exercising their power to enquire. The court also instructed the police to conduct a comprehensive enquiry on the same day and not to call the petitioners again in connection with the Anti Sterlite occurrence. The petition was disposed of with these directions.

The court's order is significant as it provides protection to the petitioners and other witnesses from police harassment. It also ensures that the police conduct a fair and comprehensive enquiry into the Anti Sterlite occurrence without harassing the witnesses. The court's order is a step towards ensuring justice for the victims of the Anti Sterlite agitation and holding the responsible parties accountable for their actions.

The Sterlite Copper plant had been a contentious issue in Thoothukudi for many years. The plant had been accused of causing environmental pollution and health hazards to the local residents. The protests against the plant had been ongoing for several years, but they had intensified in the months leading up to the May 22 incident. The protesters had demanded the closure of the plant and had accused the government of ignoring their concerns.

The May 22 incident had shocked the nation and had led to widespread condemnation of the police's actions. The police had claimed that they had opened fire in self-defence as the protesters had turned violent and had attacked them. However, the protesters had denied these allegations and had accused the police of using excessive force.

The closure of the Sterlite Copper plant had been a major victory for the protesters, who had been demanding its closure for many years. The plant had been shut down permanently by the Tamil Nadu government in May 2018, following the May 22 incident. The closure of the plant had been hailed as a victory for the environment and the local residents, who had been suffering from the plant's pollution for many years.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's order granting anticipatory bail to Raja and Fathima Babu and directing the police not to harass them or other witnesses in connection with the Anti Sterlite agitation is a significant step towards ensuring justice for the victims of the protest. The court's order provides protection to the petitioners and other witnesses from police harassment and ensures that the police conduct a fair and comprehensive enquiry into the incident. The closure of the Sterlite Copper plant is a major victory for the environment and the local residents, who had been suffering from the plant's pollution for many years.
