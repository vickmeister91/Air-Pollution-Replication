In October 2013, a court order was issued in Rajasthan, India, listing multiple civil writ petitions filed by various companies against the State of Rajasthan and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The order included the names of the petitioners and respondents in each case, as well as the names of the lawyers representing them. The court order discussed whether a batch of writ petitions should be transferred to the National Green Tribunal, established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court considered arguments from both sides and noted that the Act has its roots in United Nations Conferences on environment and development, and aims to provide effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings for the protection of the human environment.

The court ultimately decided that the cases should be transferred to the Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The Tribunal can provide relief, compensation, and restitution for victims of pollution and other environmental damage. The civil court's jurisdiction is barred in such cases. The court order stated that civil courts do not have jurisdiction to settle disputes or entertain claims related to environmental damage that can be adjudicated by the National Green Tribunal. The Tribunal has been given wide jurisdiction over all civil courts where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The Act has an overriding effect over any other Act inconsistent with it. The court ordered the transfer of cases involving environmental issues to the National Green Tribunal for specialized justice in the field of environment. The order is in line with the provisions and scheme of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.
