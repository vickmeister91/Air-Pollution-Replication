The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, is a comprehensive law to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation. The Act defines various sexual offences against children and provides for stringent punishment, including imprisonment for life, for such offences. The Act also provides for the establishment of special courts for the trial of offences under the Act.

In this case, Rajendra alias Guludhur Yadav has been convicted under Sections 5 E & 6 of the Act. Section 5 E deals with the use of a child for pornographic purposes, while Section 6 deals with the punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault. The court has found Yadav guilty of both these offences and has awarded him a jail sentence.

However, Yadav has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He has also filed an application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. The court has considered his application and has granted him bail on certain conditions.

The court has suspended the execution of the awarded jail sentence till the pendency of the appeal. This means that Yadav will not have to serve his jail sentence until his appeal is decided by the higher court. The court has also directed Yadav to furnish a personal bond and a surety bond for his release on bail. A personal bond is a promise by the accused to appear in court whenever required, while a surety bond is a promise by a third party to pay a certain amount of money if the accused fails to appear in court.

The court has listed the case for final hearing in due course. This means that the higher court will hear the appeal and decide the case on its merits. The court's decision will be final and binding on all parties.

The grant of bail to Yadav has raised concerns among child rights activists and the general public. They argue that Yadav has been convicted of serious offences against children and should not be allowed to go free. They also argue that granting bail to Yadav sends a wrong message to society and may encourage others to commit similar offences.

However, the court has granted bail to Yadav based on the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has considered Yadav's appeal and his application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. The court has also considered the nature of the offences, the evidence against Yadav, and his past conduct. Based on these factors, the court has decided to grant bail to Yadav on certain conditions.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Rajendra alias Guludhur Yadav, who has been convicted under Sections 5 E & 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The court has allowed the application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail filed by the appellant. The execution of the awarded jail sentence is suspended till the pendency of the appeal, and the appellant is directed to be enlarged on bail on furnishing a personal bond and a surety bond. The case is listed for final hearing in due course. The grant of bail to Yadav has raised concerns among child rights activists and the general public, but the court has granted bail based on the facts and circumstances of the case.
