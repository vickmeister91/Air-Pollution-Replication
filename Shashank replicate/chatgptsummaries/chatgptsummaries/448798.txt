The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to environmental issues in Hyderabad, India. The first order concerns the construction around the Hussain Sagar lake, which has suffered from pollution due to industrial and human waste. The state government has appointed consultants to develop a master plan for the lake's beautification and promote tourism, which includes the construction of large structures. However, the petitioners argue that this violates the master plan and zoning regulations, and that the Tourism Department cannot interfere with urban planning. The court is asked to decide whether construction should be allowed in and around the lake.

The second court order discusses the proposed development of the Buddha Poornima Project Area in Hyderabad and its potential impact on the water bodies and ecological balance of the area. The court notes that water bodies play an important role in maintaining ecology and that citizens have a fundamental right to potable water. The court also highlights the statutory duty of the Municipal Corporation to supply potable drinking water and ensure that water bodies remain unpolluted.
