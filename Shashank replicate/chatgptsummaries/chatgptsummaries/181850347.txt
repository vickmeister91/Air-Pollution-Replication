The State of Rajasthan filed a bunch of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and others regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The State argued that the issue was covered by a previous judgment and should be decided accordingly. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries.

The court found little force in the respondents' argument and ruled that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary. The court set aside the impugned orders and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. The writ petitions were disposed of.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court held that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary was vested in the State Government and not in the Collector. The court also noted that the Collector had not followed the due process of law while altering the boundaries of the sanctuary.

The court's decision has significant implications for the protection of wildlife sanctuaries in India.
