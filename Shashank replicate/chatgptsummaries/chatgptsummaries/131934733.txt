The court order pertains to two separate cases filed against the State of Kerala and its Land Board. The first case was filed by Kumari Varma, who claimed that the authorities had taken possession of more land than what was required to be surrendered by her father's estate. The second case pertained to the demarcation of land and the Land Board's compliance with the court's previous judgment.

In the first case, Kumari Varma's father owned an estate, and as per an order by the Land Board, a certain extent of land had to be surrendered to the state. However, Kumari Varma claimed that the authorities had taken possession of more land than what was required to be surrendered. The court had issued directions to the Land Board to ascertain the actual extent of land to be surrendered and to decide whether the plantation land was liable to be re-conveyed to the petitioner.

The Land Board passed an order in purported compliance with the court's directions, which is being challenged in the present writ petition. The court order states that the Land Board did not comply with the specific directions given by the court in a previous judgment regarding the demarcation of land. The Land Board is directed to redo the exercise of identifying and demarcating the areas covered by the exemption granted to the declarant in specific survey numbers.

The demarcation should be done with reference to the survey numbers, boundaries, and exact extent of the land. The Land Board is also directed to issue suitable directions to the Taluk Land Board and Tahsildar concerned to get the work done through them. The entire exercise should be completed within six months from the date of receipt of the judgment.

The court's order in both cases highlights the importance of compliance with court directions and the need for accurate demarcation of land. The Land Board's failure to comply with the court's directions in the first case led to a challenge in the present writ petition. The court's order in the second case directs the Land Board to redo the exercise of identifying and demarcating the areas covered by the exemption granted to the declarant in specific survey numbers.

The court's order emphasizes the need for accuracy in demarcation and the importance of complying with court directions. The Land Board is directed to complete the exercise within six months from the date of receipt of the judgment, highlighting the court's urgency in resolving the matter.

In conclusion, the court's order pertains to two separate cases filed against the State of Kerala and its Land Board. The court's order emphasizes the importance of compliance with court directions and the need for accurate demarcation of land. The Land Board is directed to redo the exercise of identifying and demarcating the areas covered by the exemption granted to the declarant in specific survey numbers and to complete the exercise within six months from the date of receipt of the judgment.
