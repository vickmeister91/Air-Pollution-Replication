In a recent court order, the petitioner, Raju Singh, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.2, Bari, District Dholpur, which refused to release his tractor and trolley. The petitioner argued that he is the registered owner of the vehicle and no confiscation proceedings are pending. The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, imposing certain conditions.

The court verified that the petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle and therefore, the tractor and trolley should be released. The court also noted that there were no confiscation proceedings pending against the petitioner. The court directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, but imposed certain conditions on the petitioner.

The conditions imposed by the court include that the petitioner must keep the vehicle and trolley intact, produce them when required by the trial court, and execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court is empowered to impose any other conditions it deems fit.

The court's decision to release the tractor and trolley is a significant victory for the petitioner. The court's decision is based on the fact that the petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle and there are no confiscation proceedings pending against him. The court's decision also shows that the court is willing to impose conditions on the petitioner to ensure that he complies with the law.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive development for the petitioner. The court's decision shows that the court is willing to protect the rights of the registered owner of a vehicle and that it is willing to impose conditions on the petitioner to ensure that he complies with the law. The court's decision is a reminder that the law must be followed and that the court is willing to take action to ensure that it is followed.
