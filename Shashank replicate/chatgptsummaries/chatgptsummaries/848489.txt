The case in question pertains to a petitioner who had requested a declaration that he did not require prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for his leasehold area. Additionally, he had also requested the quashing of an office order that had rejected his application for the grant of a second renewal of a stone mining lease. The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, issued an order that sought to address the issues raised by the petitioner.

The court first addressed the petitioner's request for a declaration that he did not require prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court noted that the petitioner had already been granted a leasehold area for stone mining and that the issue of prior approval from the Central Government had not been raised at that time. The court further noted that the petitioner had already been granted a renewal of the leasehold area once before without any objections being raised regarding prior approval from the Central Government. In light of these facts, the court held that the petitioner did not require prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for his leasehold area.

The court then turned to the petitioner's request for the quashing of an office order that had rejected his application for the grant of a second renewal of the stone mining lease. The court noted that the office order had not communicated the reasons for the rejection of the petitioner's application. The court held that if the petitioner's application had indeed been rejected, the respondents must communicate the rejection to him. If the application had not been rejected, the respondents must forward the application to the concerned authority of the Central Government within six weeks. The court also ordered that the stay of operation of the impugned order would continue until a decision was made on the petitioner's application.

In conclusion, the court's order sought to address the issues raised by the petitioner in a fair and just manner. The court held that the petitioner did not require prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for his leasehold area. Additionally, the court ordered that if the petitioner's application for the grant of a second renewal of the stone mining lease had been rejected, the respondents must communicate the reasons for the rejection to him. If the application had not been rejected, the respondents must forward the application to the concerned authority of the Central Government within six weeks. The court's order ensured that the petitioner's rights were protected and that the matter was resolved in a timely and efficient manner.
