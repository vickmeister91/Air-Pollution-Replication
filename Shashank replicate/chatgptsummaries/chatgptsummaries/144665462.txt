In a recent court order, a petition filed by Lal Singh against Abdul Gaffur under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was rejected. The court found that the application filed by the accused was premature and was rightly rejected by the trial court. The petitioner was given the liberty to renew the prayer if he so desires during cross-examination of the complainant. The stay petition was also rejected.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue a summons or order to produce such documents or things.

In the present case, Lal Singh had filed a petition against Abdul Gaffur under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking the production of certain documents. However, the court found that the application was premature and was rightly rejected by the trial court. The court held that the petitioner could renew the prayer if he so desires during cross-examination of the complainant.

The court also rejected the stay petition filed by Lal Singh. A stay petition is a request made to the court to suspend or postpone the execution of an order or judgment. In this case, Lal Singh had filed a stay petition seeking to suspend the trial proceedings until his petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was decided. However, the court found no merit in the stay petition and rejected it.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the proper procedure while filing petitions under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court found that the application filed by the accused was premature and was rightly rejected by the trial court. The petitioner was given the liberty to renew the prayer if he so desires during cross-examination of the complainant. This means that Lal Singh can still seek the production of the documents he had requested, but he will have to do so at the appropriate stage of the trial.

It is also important to note that the court rejected the stay petition filed by Lal Singh. This indicates that the court is not inclined to suspend or postpone the trial proceedings unless there are compelling reasons to do so. In this case, the court found no merit in the stay petition and rejected it.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of following the proper procedure while filing petitions under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court found that the application filed by the accused was premature and was rightly rejected by the trial court. The petitioner was given the liberty to renew the prayer if he so desires during cross-examination of the complainant. The court also rejected the stay petition filed by Lal Singh, indicating that the court is not inclined to suspend or postpone the trial proceedings unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
