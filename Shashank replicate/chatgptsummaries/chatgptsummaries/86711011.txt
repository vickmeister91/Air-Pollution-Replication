The NGT passed various orders directing the State to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal.

The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and find out whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water and file a status report. The court ordered the State to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to a later date.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The court orders the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with relevant information and records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and notes that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting other statutory remedies.

The court order states that the tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction in a case where the original applicant is barred by limitation, and the issue has not yet been decided. The tribunal has the power to condone the delay in such cases. The court also notes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court, and the writ court should be slow in entertaining any issue under the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until December 31, 2016. After that, the State is free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
