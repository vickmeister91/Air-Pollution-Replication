The court order in question relates to an application for bail filed by Rishikesh under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The case against him pertains to various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Indian Forest Act. However, during the hearing, Rishikesh's counsel sought permission to withdraw the bail application. The court granted the request, and the application was dismissed as withdrawn.

Section 439 of the CrPC deals with the power of the High Court or a Court of Session to grant bail in non-bailable offenses. It allows a person accused of a non-bailable offense to apply for bail, and the court may grant bail if it deems fit. The court may also impose conditions on the bail, such as requiring the accused to surrender their passport or report to the police station regularly.

In this case, Rishikesh had filed an application for bail under Section 439 of the CrPC. The charges against him were related to violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Indian Forest Act. The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The Indian Forest Act, 1927, provides for the protection of forests and the regulation of forest produce.

During the hearing, Rishikesh's counsel sought permission to withdraw the bail application. The reasons for this request are not clear from the court order. However, it is possible that Rishikesh's counsel may have felt that the chances of getting bail were low or that there were other legal strategies that could be pursued instead of seeking bail.

The court granted the request to withdraw the bail application, and the application was dismissed as withdrawn. This means that Rishikesh will remain in custody until further legal action is taken. It is not clear from the court order what the next steps in the case will be.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to an application for bail filed by Rishikesh under Section 439 of the CrPC. The charges against him were related to violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Indian Forest Act. However, during the hearing, Rishikesh's counsel sought permission to withdraw the bail application, which was granted by the court. The application was dismissed as withdrawn, and it is not clear what the next steps in the case will be.
