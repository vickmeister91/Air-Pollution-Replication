The court order pertains to several writ petitions filed by different parties against various government bodies, private companies, and individuals. The purpose of the court order is not specified in some cases, while in others, it involves challenging a judgment and order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) or questioning the powers and limitations of the NGT in protecting environmental rights.

In one case, the petitioners, Windsor Realty Pvt Ltd and Nish Developers Pvt Ltd, filed a writ petition against various government bodies and individuals. The court order lists the details of the petitioners and respondents involved in the case. In another case, the petitioners are M/s Shree Balaji Concepts, a partnership firm, and Mrs. Radha Satish Timblo, the wife of late Satish Timblo and partner of petitioner no. 1. The respondents include the State of Goa, Cavelossim Villagers Forum, Village Panchayat of Cavelossim, Senior Town Planner, The Collector, Assistant Engineer-Sub Division, Water Resource Department Gogol, Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, Goa State Pollution Control Board, and Goa State Biodiversity Board. Another writ petition involves Mrs. Anamika Amerkar and Shri Gurudas Amerkar as petitioners and the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, State of Goa, and Judith Almeida as respondents.

In another case, the petitioner had obtained necessary approvals and had commenced construction of a commercial and residential building in Goregaon, Mumbai, in compliance with the amended plans approved by the Planning Authority. However, an application was filed by Respondent No.2 challenging the petitioner's right to construct the building. The NGT dismissed the petitioner's application, and the petitioner filed a writ petition challenging the NGT's order. The court held that the writ petition was maintainable and that the petitioner had a right to challenge the NGT's order. The court also held that the petitioner had no alternative remedy available and that the issue raised in the petition was of considerable importance.

In another case, the court is attempting to reconcile the conflicting interests of citizens who want to ensure compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects and do not want to be harassed by belated applications. The court has appointed a senior counsel as an Amicus Curiae to assist in interpreting the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and the Constitution of India. The court is also considering the question of limitation and whether the NGT can entertain an application that is in the nature of a public interest litigation.

In another case, the court found that two judgments of the NGT were brushed aside without giving reasons. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the Tribunal to decide afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The NGT was directed to decide all the issues within a period of three months.
