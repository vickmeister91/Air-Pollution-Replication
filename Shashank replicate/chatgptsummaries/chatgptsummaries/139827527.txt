The Bombay High Court recently heard a public interest litigation challenging the order of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change granting environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial project in the Arabian Sea near South Mumbai. The petitioners sought an urgent interim relief to stay the order and restrain the respondents from taking further steps. The senior counsel for the petitioners argued that the incorporation of clause (D) in the Coastal Zone notification, 2011, as amended by the notification dated 17 February 2015, was illegal. The senior counsel for the State contested the plea and stated that the State had taken clearances for the project from different authorities.

The court order discusses the clearances obtained by the State Government for the construction of a memorial/monument in the CRZ IV (A) area. The project has received twelve clearances from various public authorities, including the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Fisheries Department, Mumbai Port Trust, and Indian Navy. The court also notes that the Union of India is in breach of the orders of the Division Bench for not forwarding the papers to the concerned office of MoEF & CC at New Delhi. The court rejects the interim prayers of the petitioners and proceeds to consider the legal issue at hand.

The court order states that objections or suggestions on proposals contained in a draft notification can be forwarded in writing to the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change within a specified period. The notification pertains to amendments to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification of 2011, including restrictions on commercial reclamation and alteration of natural features for beautification purposes, except for construction of memorials/monuments and allied facilities in exceptional cases. The concerned State Government can construct memorials/monuments and allied facilities in CRZ-IV (A) areas subject to environmental safeguards and following due procedure. The Central Government issued a notification on 17 February 2015 incorporating amendments to the principal CRZ Notification of 2011 after considering objections and suggestions.

The Central Government has made amendments to the Coastal Regulation Zone notification, 2011, allowing for reclamation for commercial purposes and dressing or altering natural features for beautification and recreation, except in certain areas. The court order addresses objections to the power given to the Central Government to dispense with the requirement of public hearing for projects that do not involve rehabilitation and resettlement of the public or are located away from human habitation. The court finds that the incorporation of this provision is not illegal and that the project in question does not involve rehabilitation and resettlement of the public and is of national importance. The prayers of the petitioners for ad-interim reliefs are rejected.

The court rejected the petitioners' request for temporary relief because the project in question is considered of national importance by the state government. The court noted that the project had received twelve clearances from various public authorities, including the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Fisheries Department, Mumbai Port Trust, and Indian Navy. The court also found that the concerned State Government can construct memorials/monuments and allied facilities in CRZ-IV (A) areas subject to environmental safeguards and following due procedure.

In summary, the Bombay High Court rejected the petitioners' request for temporary relief to stay the order granting environmental and CRZ clearance to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial project in the Arabian Sea near South Mumbai. The court found that the project had received twelve clearances from various public authorities and that the concerned State Government can construct memorials/monuments and allied facilities in CRZ-IV (A) areas subject to environmental safeguards and following due procedure. The court also addressed objections to the power given to the Central Government to dispense with the requirement of public hearing for projects that do not involve rehabilitation and resettlement of the public or are located away from human habitation and found that the incorporation of this provision is not illegal. The court noted that the project in question does not involve rehabilitation and resettlement of the public and is of national importance.
