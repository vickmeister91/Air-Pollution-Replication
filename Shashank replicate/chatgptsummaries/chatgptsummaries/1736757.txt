The Delhi High Court recently heard a case where the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) withdrew authorization and permission for various industrial activities, such as dyeing and processing of hosiery clothes, due to violations of environmental standards. The court found that the withdrawal of licenses and permissions without prior notice or hearing was violative of principles of natural justice. 

The petitioners argued that they were not given any prior notice or opportunity to be heard before the DPCC withdrew their authorization and permission. The court agreed with the petitioners and held that the DPCC's actions were arbitrary and in violation of principles of natural justice. The court noted that the DPCC had not followed the procedure laid down in law before withdrawing the authorization and permission.

Instead of quashing the orders, the court directed the petitioners to file their reply to show cause notices within three days and granted them a minimum opportunity of hearing. The entire process was to be completed within three weeks, and until then, the status quo was to be maintained. The court also directed the DPCC to provide the petitioners with all the documents and materials relied upon by them while withdrawing the authorization and permission.

The court further held that the DPCC's actions were not in compliance with the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle. The court noted that the DPCC had not taken into account the impact of its actions on the environment and the public health. The court observed that the DPCC had not considered the cumulative impact of the various industrial activities on the environment and the public health.

The court also noted that the DPCC had not considered the alternatives available to it before withdrawing the authorization and permission. The court held that the DPCC should have explored the possibility of imposing conditions on the authorization and permission instead of withdrawing them altogether.

The court emphasized the need for a balanced approach between economic development and environmental protection. The court noted that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and that it is the duty of the state to protect and improve the environment.

The court also observed that the DPCC had not followed the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) while granting the authorization and permission. The court directed the DPCC to ensure that it follows the guidelines issued by the CPCB in the future.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court held that the DPCC's actions were arbitrary and in violation of principles of natural justice. The court directed the petitioners to file their reply to show cause notices within three days and granted them a minimum opportunity of hearing. The entire process was to be completed within three weeks, and until then, the status quo was to be maintained. The court emphasized the need for a balanced approach between economic development and environmental protection and held that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the DPCC to ensure that it follows the guidelines issued by the CPCB in the future. All rights and contentions of the parties were reserved, and no order was given as to costs.
