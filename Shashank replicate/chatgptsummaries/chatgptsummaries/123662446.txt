In August 2015, the Punjab-Haryana High Court passed an order in response to a writ petition filed by M/s Rama Stone Crushing Udyog Samiti. The petitioner had sought a stay on the implementation of a notice issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The court allowed the petitioner to withdraw the petition with the liberty to avail the remedy of appeal provided under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The case pertained to the stone crushing industry in the state of Punjab, which had been under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. The Punjab Pollution Control Board had issued a notice to the petitioner, M/s Rama Stone Crushing Udyog Samiti, directing them to comply with certain environmental norms and regulations. The petitioner had challenged the notice, arguing that it was arbitrary and without basis.

The court, in its order, did not delve into the merits of the case but instead allowed the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition and pursue the remedy of appeal under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This section provides for an appeal to be filed before the National Green Tribunal against any order or decision of the State Pollution Control Board.

The court's order was passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Satish Kumar Mittal and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mahavir S. Chauhan. The judges did not provide any further explanation for their decision, but it can be inferred that they believed that the petitioner had a valid remedy available to them under the law.

The order is significant because it highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the role of the judiciary in enforcing them. The stone crushing industry, like many other industries, has a significant impact on the environment and must comply with certain norms and regulations to minimize this impact. The court's order ensures that the petitioner will have an opportunity to challenge the notice issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board and that the matter will be heard by the appropriate forum.

In conclusion, the court's order in the writ petition filed by M/s Rama Stone Crushing Udyog Samiti is an important reminder of the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition and pursue the remedy of appeal under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 ensures that the matter will be heard by the appropriate forum and that the interests of both the industry and the environment will be taken into account.
