The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order in relation to two writ petitions filed by Bharti Realty Ltd. and Lodhi Property Co. Ltd. against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The petitions sought a refund of environmental damages levied on them by the DPCC. The DPCC had directed the petitioners to pay 0.5% of the total project cost as environmental damages and furnish a bank guarantee for the same. The petitioners had complied with the order but sought a refund after a previous court ruling held that the DPCC was not empowered to levy such damages.

The DPCC argued that the previous ruling was per incuriam and that the power to levy damages and demand bank guarantees was to be read under the Water and Air Acts. However, the court rejected the DPCC's contention and allowed the petitions to be heard along with an intra-court appeal filed by the DPCC against the previous ruling.

The court order discusses the arguments made by both parties in the two writ petitions regarding the refund of damages levied by the DPCC on the petitioners for violating the Air and Water Acts. The court notes that the DPCC's demands were beyond its jurisdiction and non est, and the petitioners were coerced into making the payments and furnishing the bank guarantee. The court also states that the petitioners cannot be entitled to interest but may be entitled to a refund of the amounts paid. However, the DPCC is granted liberty to proceed afresh against the petitioners for any violations committed by them.

The court order states that the petitioners cannot be entitled to any interest as they filed their petitions after a considerable amount of time. However, if they are entitled to a refund, the respondent DPCC has the liberty to proceed against them for any violations committed. The court allows the petitions with certain directions, including the refund of the amounts collected and the release of the Bank Guarantee obtained from the petitioner. The respondent DPCC is liable for interest if they fail to refund/release within the given time. The court also grants liberty to the respondent DPCC to proceed in accordance with the law for any violations committed by the petitioners.

In summary, the court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by Bharti Realty Ltd. and Lodhi Property Co. Ltd. against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) seeking a refund of environmental damages levied on them. The DPCC had directed the petitioners to pay 0.5% of the total project cost as environmental damages and furnish a bank guarantee for the same.
