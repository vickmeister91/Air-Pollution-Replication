On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, which pertained to multiple writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land. The court order listed multiple cases (CWP Nos.) with their respective petitioners and respondents. The cases involved individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India.

The court notes that while the facts of each case are different, the authorities have given concurrent findings that the petitioners are encroachers on government land. The petitioners rely on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicates that the government is contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court acknowledges that some encroachers are landless and homeless, while others are small and marginalized landowners.

The court order pertains to the issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court refrains from expressing any views on the matter and leaves it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directs the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involves more than one government department, and the authorities are directed to take a holistic view of the matter.

The court clarifies that the decision shall not be taken as a positive mandate for conferment of proprietary rights on all encroachers of government land and that the policy decision will be subject to judicial review. Until the state government takes its final decision, status quo shall be maintained by the parties.
