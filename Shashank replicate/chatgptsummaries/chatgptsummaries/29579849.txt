The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hemraj Nama against M/S Goyal General Store. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07 from the respondent-complainant during the pendency of the appeal. However, the Appellate Court dismissed the application, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order. 

The petitioner's argument was that the ledger books were necessary to prove his case and that the Appellate Court had erred in dismissing his application. However, the court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order, and therefore, dismissed the revision petition. 

To understand the court's decision, it is important to first understand what an interlocutory order is. An interlocutory order is an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and is not a final order. It is an order that is passed to regulate the proceedings of the case and to ensure that the case is conducted in a fair and just manner. 

In this case, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07 from the respondent-complainant during the pendency of the appeal. The Appellate Court dismissed the application, which was an interlocutory order. 

The petitioner then filed a revision petition against the order, arguing that the ledger books were necessary to prove his case. However, the court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order. This means that the petitioner could not challenge the order passed by the Appellate Court in a revision petition. 

The court's decision is based on the principle that interlocutory orders are not final orders and are subject to change during the course of the proceedings. Therefore, it is not appropriate to challenge an interlocutory order in a revision petition. 

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hemraj Nama against M/S Goyal General Store. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07 from the respondent-complainant during the pendency of the appeal. However, the Appellate Court dismissed the application, which was an interlocutory order. The petitioner then filed a revision petition against the order, but the court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order and dismissed the revision petition.
