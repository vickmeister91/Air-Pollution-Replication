The Animal and Bird Welfare Society filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) alleging that the Forest Department in Madhya Pradesh was negligent in protecting snakes, which are classified as wild animals under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The PIL claimed that the respondents were not performing their duties according to the law. The respondents, on the other hand, denied the allegations and stated that they perform their duties according to the law.

The court heard both sides and found that the respondents had rescued and released 781 snakes in the last two years and registered four cases against snake charmers. The court did not find any evidence to support the petitioner's claims that the respondents were not performing their duties according to the law. However, the court order states that there is evidence that the respondents are not registering cases against snake charmers and have made 14 officials a party for rescuing snakes.

The court found that the respondents' reply regarding steps taken for snake protection appears satisfactory. The only thing required is to prevent snake charmers from capturing snakes for exhibition and earning money. The court finds that safeguards have already been provided under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the respondents are endeavoring satisfactorily in this direction.

Therefore, the petition is dismissed, and no further directions are needed. The court order highlights the importance of protecting snakes, which are an essential part of the ecosystem.
