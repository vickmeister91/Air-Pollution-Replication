In a recent court order, the case between Himmat Sing Hparihar and the State of Madhya Pradesh was addressed. The court has allowed the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. This decision was made as the notice under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 issued by the Biodiversity Board is going to be withdrawn. As a result, the petitions are dismissed accordingly.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation that aims to conserve India's biological diversity. The Act provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, as well as Biodiversity Boards at the state and national levels. These bodies are responsible for the conservation and sustainable use of India's biological resources.

In this particular case, the petitioners had filed petitions challenging the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act. Section 7 of the Act empowers the Board to issue notices to persons who are suspected of violating the provisions of the Act. The notice in question had been issued to the petitioners on the grounds that they had allegedly violated the provisions of the Act by carrying out certain activities in a protected area without obtaining the necessary permissions.

The petitioners had challenged the notice on several grounds, including that it was issued without following due process of law and that it was based on incorrect facts. The court had initially issued a stay on the notice, pending the outcome of the case.

However, in the recent court order, the court has allowed the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. This decision was made as the notice under Section 7 of the Act is going to be withdrawn by the Biodiversity Board. As a result, the petitions are dismissed accordingly.

The court's decision to allow the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed is significant. It provides the petitioners with the flexibility to pursue their case further if they so choose. At the same time, it also acknowledges the fact that the notice under Section 7 of the Act is going to be withdrawn, which suggests that the Biodiversity Board may have recognized that there were issues with the notice.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of due process of law and the need for authorities to follow the correct procedures when issuing notices under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. It also underscores the significance of the Act in protecting India's biological diversity and the need for all stakeholders to work together to conserve and sustainably use India's biological resources.
