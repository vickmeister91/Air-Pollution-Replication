The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of water pollution in various canals and distributories in Rajasthan. The first case, filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, concerns the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Srigangangar district. The case was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication, and the NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. However, the state failed to comply with the directions, and the court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

In the second case, the court discusses pollution in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal. The court directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples and analyze them to determine the standard of the water running through the distributories. The state is also directed to come up with a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan to remove encroachments and prevent contamination. The court imposes a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court also requests the High Court to hand over the records of WP No. 718/2009. The state is directed to submit a long-term and short-term plan and a report on the action taken. The court imposes a cost if the state fails to submit the plan and report. The District Collector, Ganga Nagar, is directed to be present on the next date of posting.

The third case directs the State of Rajasthan to comply with previous orders to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The State is also directed to issue show cause notices to those contributing to pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report filed by the State does not disclose the result of the notices issued to those causing pollution. The State is directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure. The order further directs the State to prepare a comprehensive short term and long term scheme with a time frame for the purpose of preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachment situated on the water bodies.

In the fourth case, the court ordered the State Government to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and explain why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- to be deposited in the Environment Relief Fund. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and for a compliance report to be filed. The State Government failed to comply with the court's orders, and the court gave them another chance to comply. The court also directed the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental issues. The court emphasized the importance of enforcing and protecting fundamental rights and the need to exhaust all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

Finally, the court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy, if that is efficacious. In this particular case, the court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Such application/representation shall be filed by 31st December, 2016. Till 31st December, 2016, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s).

The state is also directed to come up with a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan to remove encroachments and prevent contamination.
