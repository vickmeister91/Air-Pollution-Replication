The Indian judiciary has been taking a proactive stance in ensuring that environmental and health regulations are being followed by coal power thermal plants. In a recent court order, the formation of a committee was ordered to oversee the compliance of these regulations. The committee will consist of five members, including three professors and two advocates. The state government will provide the committee with necessary equipment and a vehicle to carry out their duties.

The primary responsibility of the committee will be to review previous court orders and compile a report on the compliance of power generating units with regulations. The respondents, who are the power plant owners, have been directed to cooperate with the committee during inspections. The court expects an interim report from the committee before the next hearing.

The court has also made it clear that the remuneration of the committee members will be decided later. This is an important point as it ensures that the committee members are not influenced by any monetary considerations and can carry out their duties without any bias.

In another court order related to the same matter, the respondents have been directed to cooperate with a committee that will inspect their power generating units. The remuneration for the committee members will be decided by the court later. The matter has been adjourned and will be listed on October 29, 2018.

These court orders are significant as they highlight the importance of environmental and health regulations in the operation of coal power thermal plants. The formation of a committee to oversee compliance is a positive step towards ensuring that these regulations are being followed. The inclusion of professors and advocates in the committee ensures that there is a diverse range of expertise and knowledge being brought to the table.

The court's directive for the respondents to cooperate with the committee during inspections is also crucial. It ensures that the committee can carry out their duties effectively and without any hindrance. The interim report that the court expects from the committee before the next hearing will provide valuable insights into the compliance of power generating units with regulations.

The court's decision to defer the decision on the remuneration of the committee members is also commendable. It ensures that the committee members are not influenced by any monetary considerations and can carry out their duties without any bias.

In conclusion, the court orders related to the compliance of environmental and health regulations by coal power thermal plants are a positive step towards ensuring that these regulations are being followed. The formation of a committee to oversee compliance, the inclusion of experts in the committee, and the directive for the respondents to cooperate with the committee during inspections are all important measures that will help in achieving this goal. The court's decision to defer the decision on the remuneration of the committee members is also a welcome move that ensures that the committee members can carry out their duties without any bias.
