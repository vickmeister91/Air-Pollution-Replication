The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Paras White Gold Agro Industries against the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner sought a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents to implement the notification dated 20/10/2015 in letter and spirits and not to charge ECC on vehicles entering Delhi carrying 'edible oil' (an essential commodity) in compliance of order of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 9/10/2015 to such effect. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The issue at hand is the exemption of vehicles from Environment Compensation Charge (ECC) in Delhi. The Government of NCT of Delhi issued a notification in compliance with the order of the Supreme Court, levying ECC on commercial vehicles. However, vehicles carrying essential commodities such as foodstuffs and oil tankers were exempted. The court dismissed a petition seeking exemption for vehicles carrying edible oils, stating that the government had limited the definition of foodstuffs to raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, and tankers carrying petroleum products. The court also dismissed an application for stay.

The petitioner, Paras White Gold Agro Industries, argued that edible oils should be included in the definition of foodstuffs and therefore exempt from ECC. The court, however, disagreed and stated that the government had already defined foodstuffs in its notification and that the court could not expand the definition. The court also noted that the government had exempted tankers carrying petroleum products, which were not included in the definition of foodstuffs, and therefore the government had the discretion to decide which commodities to exempt.

The court also dismissed an application for stay, which would have prevented the government from collecting ECC from vehicles carrying edible oils until the court had made a final decision on the matter. The court stated that the petitioner had not provided any compelling reasons for granting a stay and that the government had already implemented the notification and started collecting ECC from commercial vehicles.

In conclusion, the court order upholds the government's notification and its decision to exempt certain commodities from ECC. The court has clarified that the definition of foodstuffs is limited to raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, and tankers carrying petroleum products, and that edible oils are not included in this definition. The court has also rejected the petitioner's request for a stay on the collection of ECC from vehicles carrying edible oils. The court's decision is final and binding, and the government is expected to continue implementing the notification and collecting ECC from commercial vehicles.
