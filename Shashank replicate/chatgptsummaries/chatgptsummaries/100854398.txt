The first court order involves a case between M/S Krishna Bus Service Pvt. Ltd and the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner's buses were granted stage carriage permits by the State Transport Authority of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) started challaning the buses on the ground of overtaking and picking up/dropping passengers without a valid bus stop. The petitioner chose to compound the same by paying fines ranging from Rs. 2000/- to Rs. 5,600/-. The petitioner filed a writ petition stating that the acts of the respondents are arbitrary and unjustified and violate his fundamental rights. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the show-cause notices issued to the petitioner related to the violation of the permit conditions by the vehicles of the petitioner. The court also stated that the provisions of Section 200(2) are not attracted.

The second court order discusses the directions issued by the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta v. UOI regarding the operation of heavy and medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles in Delhi. These directions include the requirement for speed control devices, segregation of bus lanes, and the use of authorized drivers. The court acknowledges concerns from bus operators that these directions have been used to harass them, but also notes that the traffic police have no discretion in enforcing them. The court suggests that the petitioners seek clarification from the Supreme Court regarding the subsequent judgment in the UPSRTC case.

The third court order suggests that the petitioners should seek clarification from the Supreme Court regarding a previous judgment. The court cannot undertake this exercise. The matter has been adjourned and will be taken up in due course. The interim directions are causing hardship to the respondents, but the judgment of Tara Kant Jha is binding and no further orders are required. The petition and pending application are disposed of accordingly.
