The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently considered three petitions filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dewas in Criminal Case No.168/2015 on 05.01.2015, whereby cognizance was taken against the applicants under Sections 44 and 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The applicants argued that there was no averment in the complaint as to how they were connected with the offence. 

The court examined the principle of vicarious liability and held that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the company would be imputed to the company/corporation. The court examined the facts of the case and relevant paragraphs of the complaint and dismissed the petitions. The court order pertains to a case where the applicants, who are directors of a company, were issued a process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. without any incriminating evidence against them. 

The court held that when a company is accused, its directors can only be held liable if there is sufficient incriminating evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or the statutory regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability. As there was no such evidence against the applicants, the order of issuing process against them was set aside. However, the court clarified that if sufficient incriminating material surfaces during the trial, the CJM can exercise his powers to rope in the applicants. The impugned order against the applicants was set aside with liberty.

The court examined the principle of vicarious liability, which is a legal concept that holds one person responsible for the actions of another. In the context of a company, the principle of vicarious liability means that the company can be held responsible for the actions of its directors or employees. The court held that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the company would be imputed to the company/corporation. This means that if the directors of a company are found to have criminal intent, the company can be held responsible for their actions.

The court also examined the role of directors in a company and held that when a company is accused, its directors can only be held liable if there is sufficient incriminating evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or the statutory regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability. This means that if there is no evidence to suggest that the directors were involved in the alleged offence, they cannot be held liable. 

In this case, the court found that there was no incriminating evidence against the applicants and therefore, the order of issuing process against them was set aside. However, the court clarified that if sufficient incriminating material surfaces during the trial, the CJM can exercise his powers to rope in the applicants. This means that if new evidence comes to light during the trial, the applicants can still be held liable for the alleged offence.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of the principle of vicarious liability in holding companies responsible for the actions of their directors and employees. It also emphasizes the need for sufficient incriminating evidence to hold directors liable for the alleged offence. The court's decision to set aside the order of issuing process against the applicants without sufficient evidence serves as a reminder of the importance of due process and the need for evidence-based decision-making in the legal system.
