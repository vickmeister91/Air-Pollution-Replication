The Andhra High Court recently issued three court orders related to criminal proceedings against directors of companies accused of issuing cheques without sufficient funds. In the first case, Avon Industries Ltd. and its directors were accused of issuing bounced cheques to Integrated Finance Company Ltd. The accused argued that the liquidation proceedings against the company meant that only the company court had jurisdiction and that the Sick Industry (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 barred criminal proceedings. However, the court rejected both arguments and held that the directors could be held liable for the company's offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, as long as the complaint contained specific averments showing their involvement. The court cited several previous judgments to support its conclusion.

In the second case, the court discussed the liability of directors, managers, and other responsible officers of a company for the conduct of its business under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court cited several judgments of the Supreme Court to establish that before prosecuting these individuals, there must be a perceivable accusation against them symbolizing the part played by them, which attracts the offense alleged. The court then examined three criminal petitions against directors of different companies and concluded that the involvement of the directors is discernible from the averments made in the complaint, and therefore, the prosecution against them is not an abuse of the process of the court.

The third case pertained to two criminal petitions involving several accused who are directors of a company accused of issuing cheques without sufficient funds. The accused argued that they had nothing to do with the company's affairs and that the proceedings against them were an abuse of the court's process. However, the court stated that it was for the complainant to prove the allegations, but at this stage, it could not be ruled out that the directors were involved in the company's business affairs and that knowledge and negligence could be attributed to them. The court also noted that the accused could seek their discharge by filing appropriate petitions before the respective court. Ultimately, the court dismissed the criminal petitions.

These court orders highlight the importance of holding directors and other responsible officers of a company accountable for the conduct of its business. The court made it clear that directors cannot escape liability by claiming that they had nothing to do with the company's affairs or that criminal proceedings are barred by certain laws. Instead, the court emphasized that specific averments showing the involvement of directors must be made in the complaint, and the complainant must prove the allegations against them.

The court also noted that directors could seek their discharge by filing appropriate petitions before the respective court. This means that if directors can prove that they had no knowledge or negligence in the company's affairs, they may be discharged from the case. However, the burden of proof lies with the accused, and they must provide evidence to support their claims.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder to directors and other responsible officers of companies that they cannot escape liability for the conduct of the company's business. They must ensure that they are aware of the company's affairs and take steps to prevent any illegal activities. Failure to do so could result in criminal proceedings against them, and they could be held liable for the company's offences under the Negotiable Instruments Act.
