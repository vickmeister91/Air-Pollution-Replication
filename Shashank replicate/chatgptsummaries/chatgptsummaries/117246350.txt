The petitioner, P. Sheik Moideen, had filed a writ petition challenging the order passed by the government that refused permission to use a road inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The petitioner had argued that the road was essential for the transportation of goods and that the government's decision had caused him financial losses.

The court noted that the petitioner had waited for over a year before filing the writ petition, and during this time, he had continued to use the road without permission. The court also observed that the petitioner had not come with clean hands, as he had violated the law by using the road without permission.

The court further noted that the Periyar Tiger Reserve was a protected area, and any activity that could harm the environment or wildlife was strictly prohibited.
