The Orissa High Court recently heard a writ application seeking a direction to execute a mining lease deed in favor of the petitioner for the Unchabali, Nayagarh Iron Ore Mines. The State of Orissa objected to the petition, stating that the petitioner failed to submit the approved mining plan within the stipulated time period. The petitioner argued that the delay was not a fact and that the modification of the area of lease was necessary due to the directions issued by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board. The Union of India was impleaded as Opposite Party No.3, and the Ministry of Mines consulted the Department of Legal Affairs before issuing a letter dated 31.5.2012.

The court order discusses a case related to mining lease in the Keonjhar district of Odisha. The court considers whether a circular issued by the Union of India in the Ministry of Mines is in line with the MMDR Act, 1957. The court also examines whether the petitioner's request for a mining lease is justified. The order lists several undisputed facts related to the case, including the grant of a prospecting license and mining lease, approval from the Central Government, and the submission and approval of a mining plan. The order also mentions the recommendation for diversion of forest land and the requirement for the petitioner to deposit funds towards compensatory afforestation and other expenses.

The court order discusses objections raised by the State and Union of India against a petitioner seeking approval for a mining lease. The objections include delay in obtaining approval for mining plans, the petitioner holding six leases, and a circular requiring fresh approval from the Ministry of Mines for reduction of lease area. The court rejects the first two objections as having no legal basis and considers the challenge to the circular. The circular requires the State to approach the Central Government again if it intends to revise/reduce the area approved by the Central Government. The court notes relevant sections of the MMDR Act, 1957 and considers the petitioner's alternative submission that there has been no violation of the Act or the circular.

The court order states that for a mining lease to be granted, there must be evidence of mineral deposits in the area and a duly approved mining plan by the Central or State Government. The Indian Bureau of Mines approved a modification in the mining plan for a reduced area, and the necessary approvals have been granted. The court concludes that there has been no violation of the impugned Circular dated 31.05.2012 under Annexure-36, and directs the opposite parties to execute the mining lease for a period of 20 years in favor of the petitioner over the reduced area at the earliest. The writ application is allowed to the extent indicated above.
