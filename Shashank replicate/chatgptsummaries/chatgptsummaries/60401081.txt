The Madras High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two writ petitions filed by R. Savitha and P.R. Prabhu against the Commissioner of Police and others. The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the 2nd respondent from interfering in a civil dispute between the petitioners and respondents 3 to 5 over a property in Coimbatore. The court heard arguments from both sides and disposed of both writ petitions by a common order.

The court summarized the brief case of the petitioners and respondents and noted that the 2nd respondent had issued summons to the petitioners under Sections 160 and 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court heard arguments from both sides and disposed of both writ petitions by a common order. The court order restrains the 2nd respondent from harassing the petitioners in relation to a civil dispute over a property. However, the respondents 1 and 2 are allowed to take action in accordance with the law in case of any law and order problem between the parties. The writ petitions are disposed of with no costs.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the ownership of a property in Coimbatore. The petitioner, Savitha, had given a power of attorney deed to the 4th respondent in 1997 to arrange financial assistance. The 4th respondent claims to have paid the entire sale consideration to Savitha and obtained the power of attorney deed. However, the sale deed was not registered in his name. The 4th respondent sold an extent of 528 sq.ft. out of the total extent of 4840 sq.ft. to the 5th respondent, who in turn, sold the property measuring an extent of 528 sq.ft. to the 3rd respondent under a registered sale deed dated 03.02.2012.

Savitha and her husband filed a suit to cancel the sale deed and declare themselves as the absolute owners of the property. The court ordered that the suit should be decided on its merits and restrained the 2nd respondent from harassing the petitioners under the guise of interfering with the civil dispute.

The court order is significant as it provides relief to the petitioners who were being harassed by the 2nd respondent in relation to a civil dispute over a property. The court has restrained the 2nd respondent from interfering in the dispute and has allowed the respondents 1 and 2 to take action in accordance with the law in case of any law and order problem between the parties.

The court has also ordered that the suit filed by Savitha and her husband should be decided on its merits. This is a significant development as it provides an opportunity for the petitioners to have their case heard and for justice to be served.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the petitioners and provides them with some relief in their ongoing dispute over the ownership of a property in Coimbatore. The court has provided clear instructions to the respondents and has ensured that the case will be decided on its merits. This is a positive step towards resolving the dispute and ensuring that justice is served.
