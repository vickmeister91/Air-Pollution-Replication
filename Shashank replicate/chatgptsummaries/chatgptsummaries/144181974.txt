In a civil writ petition filed by M/s. Pooja Industries against the Regional Officer of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, the court issued an order pertaining to the seizure of the petitioner's factory. The respondent had seized the factory on 08.10.2010, but the petitioner had furnished an undertaking that they would not manufacture, store, sell or transport plastic carry bags which had been banned by the State Government. 

The court issued a notice of writ and stay petition to the respondents and ordered that the operation of the seizure memo remain stayed until further orders, provided the petitioner furnishes the undertaking within two weeks. This order essentially means that the petitioner's factory will not be seized until further orders from the court, as long as they comply with the undertaking they have given.

The issue of plastic carry bags has been a contentious one in India, with several states banning their use due to their harmful impact on the environment. In Rajasthan, the use of plastic carry bags was banned in 2010, and the State Pollution Control Board has been tasked with enforcing this ban. 

In this case, it appears that the petitioner's factory was seized by the Pollution Control Board for violating the ban on plastic carry bags. However, the petitioner claims to have given an undertaking that they would not manufacture, store, sell or transport these bags, and therefore their factory should not have been seized. 

The court's order seems to suggest that they are willing to consider the petitioner's argument, and have ordered that the seizure memo remain stayed until further orders. This means that the Pollution Control Board cannot take any further action against the petitioner's factory until the court issues a new order.

It is worth noting that this is a civil writ petition, which means that it is a legal remedy that can be sought by any person who believes that their fundamental rights have been violated. In this case, the petitioner is seeking relief from the seizure of their factory, which they believe was done without proper cause.

Overall, the court's order in this case is a temporary stay on the seizure of the petitioner's factory, pending further orders from the court. It remains to be seen what the final outcome of this case will be, and whether the petitioner will be able to continue operating their factory without any further interference from the Pollution Control Board.
