The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, with the latest amendment being in 2006.

In the present case, Bachchu was accused of assaulting forest officials and being in possession of one pair of antlers of deer (Sambhar).

The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and its derivatives. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Bachchu's counsel argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and that he is an old aged person suffering from heart disease. The court considered the arguments of both the prosecution and the defence and granted bail to Bachchu. The court directed Bachchu to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount.

Bail is a legal process that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial or other legal proceedings. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused person will appear in court when required and will not commit any further offences while on bail. Bail is usually granted when the court is satisfied that the accused person is not a flight risk and will not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

In the present case, the court granted bail to Bachchu after considering his age and health condition. The court also considered the nature of the offence and the evidence against Bachchu. The court was satisfied that Bachchu was not a flight risk and would not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. The court, therefore, granted bail to Bachchu on the condition that he would appear in court when required and would not commit any further offences while on bail.
