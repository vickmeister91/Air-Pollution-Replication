The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by a man named Mathachan, who was the third accused in a case related to the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Along with others, Mathachan had been convicted and sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment. However, he had appealed against the conviction, but the appeal was dismissed.

During the hearing of the revision petition, Mathachan's counsel informed the court that Mathachan had passed away. As a result, the revision petition had become abated. The court dismissed the revision petition as abated.

The Wildlife (Protection) Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. It was enacted in 1972 with the aim of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife.

The case in question involved Mathachan and others who had been convicted of violating the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The details of the case are not provided in the court order, but it can be assumed that they were involved in some form of illegal hunting or poaching.

Mathachan had appealed against his conviction, but his appeal was dismissed. He then filed a revision petition, which is a legal remedy available to a person who is aggrieved by a decision of a lower court. A revision petition can be filed before a higher court, which has the power to examine the legality or correctness of the decision of the lower court.

However, during the hearing of the revision petition, Mathachan's counsel informed the court that Mathachan had passed away. This meant that the revision petition had become abated. Abatement is a legal term that means the termination of a legal proceeding due to the death of a party to the proceeding.

In this case, since Mathachan had passed away, the revision petition had become abated. The court, therefore, dismissed the revision petition as abated. This means that the decision of the lower court, which had convicted and sentenced Mathachan and others, stands.

The court order highlights the importance of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the need to enforce it strictly. The act is aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats, which are essential for the ecological balance of the planet. Illegal hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife can have a devastating impact on the environment and can lead to the extinction of species.

The court order also highlights the importance of legal remedies available to a person who is aggrieved by a decision of a lower court. A revision petition is one such remedy, which allows a person to challenge the legality or correctness of a decision of a lower court. However, in this case, the revision petition became abated due to the death of Mathachan, and the decision of the lower court stands.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Mathachan, who was the third accused in a case related to the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Mathachan and others were convicted and sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment. Mathachan had appealed against the conviction, but the appeal was dismissed. During the hearing of the revision petition, Mathachan's counsel informed the court that Mathachan had passed away and therefore, the revision petition had become abated. The court dismissed the revision petition as abated. The court order highlights the importance of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the need to enforce it strictly, as well as the importance of legal remedies available to a person who is aggrieved by a decision of a lower court.
