The court orders presented here are all related to eviction petitions filed by landlords against tenants who have not paid rent or are in arrears. In the first case, Smt. Kanti Devi has filed an eviction petition against Mr. Aftaf Ahmed @ Sikander, claiming to be the owner of the property and alleging that the respondent is a tenant who has not paid rent. The respondent denies the claims and raises objections, including that the site plan is not accurate and that he did not receive a notice due to illness. Witnesses and evidence are presented by both parties, and the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented.

In the second case, the petitioner has filed a complaint against the respondent for non-payment of rent. The court has heard both parties and examined the evidence presented. The respondent has argued that the petitioner's attorney cannot depose for the principal and that the legal notice and postal receipts are manipulated and forged. However, the court has found that the petitioner has proved the service of the demand notice and the respondent has failed to rebut the presumption. The court has also cited Section 14(2) of the DRC Act which provides for the recovery of possession of premises if the tenant makes the required payment or deposit.

The third court order states that the respondent has made consecutive delays in paying rent for three months and has not deposited the rent in court as required by law. The petitioner has served a legal notice demanding enhanced rent, but the respondent has not complied. The court finds that the respondent has failed to rebut the presumption that the legal notice was not served and has not established that he had paid the rent regularly. Therefore, an eviction order is passed in favor of the petitioner. However, the respondent is entitled to the benefit of Section 14(2) of the DRC Act, and if they pay all deposits legally recoverable of arrears of rent within one month, they shall not be evicted on the ground mentioned in Section 14(1)(a) of the Act. The case is put up for consideration under Section 14(2) of the Act on 30.10.2012.

In the fourth case, the court has issued an eviction order in favor of the petitioner and against the respondent for a godown/hall on the ground floor of a property in Delhi. The site plan has been marked as Ex.C-1 and no costs have been ordered. The file will be consigned to the record room. The order was announced in open court on September 15, 2012.

All of these court orders highlight the importance of evidence and the burden of proof in eviction cases. In each case, the petitioner has presented evidence to support their claim that the respondent has not paid rent or is in arrears, and the respondent has attempted to rebut this evidence. However, in each case, the court has ultimately found in favor of the petitioner, either because the respondent has failed to rebut the presumption or because they have not established that they have paid rent regularly.

Additionally, the court orders reference the DRC Act and its provisions for the recovery of possession of premises. Section 14(2) of the Act provides tenants with the opportunity to avoid eviction if they make the required payment or deposit, and this provision is referenced in two of the court orders. This highlights the importance of tenants understanding their rights and obligations under the law, and the potential consequences of failing to comply with these obligations.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of evidence and legal knowledge in eviction cases, and the potential consequences of failing to comply with rent payment obligations. They also highlight the role of the court in interpreting and applying the law to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.
