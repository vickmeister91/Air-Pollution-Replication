Island Aviation Services Limited was penalized for bringing in passengers of Maldivian origin without the required visas. The company argued that the passenger had a student visa and his previous entry and stay in India was based on this visa. However, the court noted that the company had infringed immigration rules and imposed a penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- under Section 3 of the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act.

The company appealed the decision, and the case was heard again. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to the visa requirements stipulated by the Bureau of Immigration. After considering all the evidence, the penalty was reduced from Rs.1,00,000/- to Rs.30,000/-.

The case highlights the importance of complying with immigration rules and regulations. Companies that transport passengers must ensure that all necessary visas and documents are in order before allowing passengers to board. Failure to do so can result in penalties and legal action.

It is also important for individuals to be aware of the visa requirements when traveling to different countries. In this case, the passenger had a student visa, but it was not valid for travel to India. It is essential to check the visa requirements before traveling to avoid any legal issues.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder to companies and individuals to comply with immigration rules and regulations to avoid penalties and legal action.
