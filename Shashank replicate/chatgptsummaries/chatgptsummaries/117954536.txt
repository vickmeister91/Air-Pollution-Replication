The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over lease agreements between parties. In the first case, Mrs. Basant Verma filed a lawsuit against M/S Namdhari Seeds for not vacating her property after the lease expired. The lease was for a period of three years, and the defendant had an option to renew it, but they did not exercise it. The plaintiff claimed damages for the unauthorized use of the property, non-payment of electricity and water bills, and occupation charges. The court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff Rs. 19,93,065/- along with interest. The defendant argued that the lease was for commercial purposes and that they had purchased non-judicial stamp papers for the renewal of the lease.

In the second case, the court order discusses a lease agreement between the plaintiff and defendant for a commercial property. The defendant argues that the premises were meant for commercial use and that the plaintiff was aware of this. The defendant also claims that the premises were sealed by the MCD, rendering them unusable, and therefore, the tenancy was surrendered to the plaintiff. The defendant also presents a counterclaim for the refund of their security deposit and other expenses. The court frames several issues, including whether the premises were leased for commercial purposes, whether the defendant is entitled to a refund, and whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages. A witness is examined by way of affidavit.

In the third case, the defendant is claiming recovery of Rs. 5,80,000/- as a counterclaim. The court heard testimony from witnesses on both sides, including an examination of records related to the premises in question. The plaintiff's wife testified that she was not aware of the defendant's business activities in the premises, and denied signing certain documents related to the enhancement of electricity load. The defendant's witnesses testified that the premises were being used for commercial purposes, and that the plaintiff was aware of this. The defendant also presented a power of attorney document, which the witness testified was not executed in his presence.

In the fourth case, the court order confirms that the defendant company is not a partnership firm but a registered company, although it is unclear when the change was made. The deponent was not involved in the case until after 2008 and was not authorized to negotiate the lease agreement with the plaintiff. The defendant's office was located in Delhi in 2009, but it is unclear if it still is. The deponent did not sign the written statement or supporting affidavit, and the defendant is shown as a partnership firm in the written statement. The deponent confirms that the defendant was allowed to run a shop in the premises at H-6 Green Park.

In the fifth case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the purpose of a lease agreement between two parties. The plaintiff claims that the property was leased for residential purposes only, while the defendant argues that it was leased for commercial purposes. The court examines the lease agreement and finds that it is silent on the specific use of the property, but contains clauses that suggest it was leased for commercial purposes. The court ultimately rules in favor of the defendant, stating that the property was leased for commercial purposes, albeit indirectly.

In the sixth case, the plaintiff had leased out a property to the defendant for commercial use, even though it was not specifically mentioned in the lease deed. The defendant had taken steps to renew the lease, but the plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages after the premises was sealed by the MCD as she herself was a contributory to this wrong. The defendant is liable to pay rent for April and May 2007, along with electricity and water charges till 20.01.2008. The plaintiff is not entitled to be reimbursed for damages in the suit property.

In the seventh case, the court order pertains to a property that was sealed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2007 for being used for commercial purposes instead of residential. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant misused the property, but the court found that both parties were equally responsible for the illegal use. The defendant claimed a refund for the security deposit and money spent on stamp papers, but the court ruled that the defendant was not entitled to the amount spent on stamp papers and only entitled to the interest-free security deposit after deducting rent and utility charges. The plaintiff was entitled to recover rent and utility charges for the period in question. The suit and counterclaim were decreed accordingly.

In summary, these court orders all involve disputes over lease agreements for commercial properties. The courts examine the lease agreements and other evidence to determine the purpose of the lease and whether the parties are entitled to damages or refunds. In some cases, the courts find that both parties are responsible for the illegal use of the property and apportion liability accordingly. Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of clear and specific lease agreements to avoid disputes and confusion in the future.
