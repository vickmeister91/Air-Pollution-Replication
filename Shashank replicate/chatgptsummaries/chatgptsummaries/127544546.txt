The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed in relation to an industry that had a valid D&O license until March 31, 2016. The owner of the industry filed one writ petition, while nearby residents filed the other. The owner had obtained a Consent to Operate from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, but the Panchayat refused to renew the license without a No Objection Certificate from the District Medical Officer. 

The court found that there was no requirement for such a certificate and that the owner's Consent to Operate was sufficient. The court also noted that the objectors' challenge to the competency of the PCB to grant the Consent to Operate should be brought before the Tribunal. The court order states that while the owner of an industry has been granted Consent to Operate by the PCB, the same has to be challenged before the Tribunal as provided under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. 

The court will consider the contentions of the objectors who have raised concerns about the industry's impact on the environment. The court also notes that the owner's unit is categorized as Orange, which requires a minimum distance of 10 meters from any other residences. The court directs the Panchayat to verify whether the industry was established before the construction of nearby residences. If the industry was established first, the Panchayat can issue a D&O Licence with conditions. 

The court also addresses concerns about excess sound pollution caused by the industry at night and directs the owner to comply with conditions set by the Panchayat. The owner cannot start the unit until the Panchayat completes the proceedings and issues a D&O Licence. The Panchayat must finalize the proceedings within two months.
