The recent court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest. The petitioners argue that the provision is arbitrary and violates their rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. The State government has defended the provision, stating that it is necessary to protect forest land and waste land in the interregnum period until final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. The court has heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order discusses various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court also emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle. The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area.
