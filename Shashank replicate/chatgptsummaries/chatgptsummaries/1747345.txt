The court order in question pertains to a revisional petition taken out by the accused in a case registered for the offense under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The main issue at hand is based on the provision of law laid down under subsection (5) of Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as amended by Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (West Bengal Amendment) Act, 1988.

The court held that the petitioner/accused of the instant case became entitled to the benefit as laid down under the amended provision of Section 167(5) of the CrPC from May 2, 1989, and onward. This provision states that if the investigation is not completed within 90 days of the accused being taken into custody, the accused shall be entitled to be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail. The court noted that the accused had been in custody for more than 90 days and that the investigation had not been completed within that time frame. Therefore, the accused was entitled to be released on bail.

The court also noted the inordinate delay in taking a decision under Section 167(5) of the CrPC and the lack of a special reason for continuation of the investigation. The court observed that the investigation had been going on for more than two years, and there was no progress in the case. The court held that the accused had been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India.

The court allowed the petition-in-revision and directed the accused/petitioner to be discharged. The court held that the accused had been in custody for more than two years, and there was no progress in the case. The court observed that the accused had been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, and there was no justification for continuing his custody any further.

In conclusion, the court order in question highlights the importance of the right to a speedy trial and the need for the timely completion of investigations. The court held that the accused had been deprived of his fundamental right to a speedy trial and that there was no justification for continuing his custody any further. The court's decision to allow the petition-in-revision and direct the accused/petitioner to be discharged is a significant step towards ensuring that the justice system functions efficiently and effectively. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a reminder to law enforcement agencies and the judiciary of the need to prioritize the timely completion of investigations and the speedy disposal of cases.
