The National Green Tribunal heard multiple appeals related to mining operations in Kanyakumari District. The first appeal was filed by M/S. Indian Rare Earths Limited against the rejection of their Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance application, while the second appeal was filed by M/S. V.V. Minerals seeking a declaration that the Ministry of Environment and Forests was not entitled to recommend the grant of environmental clearance in violation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR) and Mineral Concession Rules (MCR). The Tribunal heard arguments from both sides and issued a judgment on February 24, 2014.

The court order pertains to a mining lease granted by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 1981, which was renewed in 2004. The appellant submitted an application for CRZ clearance in 2013, which was rejected by the 2nd respondent due to objections raised by the 3rd respondent. The appellant challenged the rejection, stating that the objections were not relevant to the merits of the application. The court noted that the 1st respondent had rejected the application even in respect of an area owned entirely by the appellant, and that no environmental or scientific objection had been raised. The court ordered the 2nd respondent to reconsider the application on its merits.

In another case, the court order discusses an appeal made by a unit for CRZ clearance under CRZ Notification for mining activities in Kanyakumari District. The unit submitted three separate applications for CRZ clearance, but objections were raised by the 3rd respondent who claimed that his land was included in the area claimed by the unit and he had not given consent. The District Coastal Zone Management Authority deferred the proposal for want of land ownership documents and consent letters from the landowners. The court rejected the appeal and stated that the surface rights were mandatory for processing the application under CRZ Notification, 2011.

The District Coastal Zone Management Authority rejected a proposal for a mining lease renewal due to lack of land documents and consent from landowners. The land in question belonged to various individuals, including the 3rd respondent who objected to the grant of any kind of clearance. The 3rd respondent had already obtained CRZ clearance for mining activity in some areas and filed a civil suit to enforce its surface rights in the minerals lying in its lands. The appellant's theory that post facto consent from the landowners can be obtained prior to actual mining is against the law. The entire application submitted by the appellant is invalid in the eye of the law.

The court order discusses two cases. In the first case, the appellant's application for CRZ clearance was rejected by the Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority, and the court found that the rejection was valid and there was no reason to interfere with the decision. In the second case, the applicant sought a declaration that the Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC) was not entitled to recommend the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) for a mining project. The court found that the EAC had not properly checked for CRZ approval and had made recommendations without considering all relevant information. The court also found that the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the EAC was not entitled to recommend the grant of EC.

This is a court order regarding an appeal by Indian Rare Earths Ltd. challenging the rejection of their Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance application for a mining project. The third respondent in the appeal has sought a declaration that the recommendation made by the Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) for the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) in respect of the mining project is invalid. The court considered the submissions made by both parties and looked into all available materials. The court found that the appellant was not the owner of the entire extent of the subject matter mining lease area, but only a part of it, and that the appellant had not obtained consent from the landowners for the part of the land owned by the third respondent and others. The court ultimately dismissed the appeal.

The court order discusses a dispute over a mining lease application in which the appellant did not have the consent of all landowners, including the 3rd respondent. The 3rd respondent filed a suit claiming ownership of the land and obtained an injunction against granting the mining lease to a third party. The appellant argued that consent was only required at the time of actual mining operations, not at the time of renewal or application. The court rejected this argument and found that the appellant did not provide evidence of lawful possession of the lease properties as required by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also noted that the 3rd respondent was not given an opportunity to be heard during the technical presentation to the Expert Appraisal Committee. Ultimately, the court rejected the appellant's request to declare the EAC recommendations as not in accordance with the law.

The court order discusses a case regarding an application for mining in another person's land. A public hearing was conducted, and objections were raised by the third respondent, who claimed ownership of a part of the land. However, the objections were not considered by the Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC) when they recommended the grant of an environmental clearance. The court found that the EAC did not consider the lawful possession criteria and did not follow the relevant statutory provisions. The court also noted that the applicant should have obtained surface rights or consent from the landowner
