The Indian judiciary system is responsible for ensuring that justice is served in all cases that come before it. In this regard, the courts have to make decisions based on the evidence presented before them. Two court orders that have been issued recently highlight the importance of evidence in determining the outcome of a case.

The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Shahnaz Khatoon against the State of Jharkhand and other officials. The petitioner sought to prohibit the construction of a government pond on her land without issuing any notice for acquisition. The petitioner claimed to have purchased the land from the sons of the original landlord, while the respondents claimed that the land is government land and that the pond has been in existence for over 30 years.

The court heard both parties and examined the evidence presented before it. After considering the evidence, the court will make a decision based on the facts of the case. This case highlights the importance of evidence in determining the outcome of a case. The court will only make a decision based on the evidence presented before it.

The second court order discusses a case involving the transfer of property by sale. The court cites previous judgments to establish that once a jamabandi is opened in favor of a person, it can only be canceled by initiating a proceeding by the Collector under Section 4(h) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act. The petitioner provided evidence of possession of the land in question, and the court found that the respondent's argument that the land has vested in the State Government cannot be accepted.

The court ordered the respondent authorities to initiate acquisition proceedings of the land and pay suitable compensation to the petitioner in lieu of her dispossession. This case highlights the importance of evidence in determining the outcome of a case. The court will only make a decision based on the evidence presented before it.

In both cases, the courts have emphasized the importance of evidence in determining the outcome of a case. The courts have examined the evidence presented before them and made decisions based on the facts of the case. This highlights the importance of presenting strong evidence in court to support one's case.

In conclusion, the Indian judiciary system plays a crucial role in ensuring that justice is served in all cases that come before it. The courts have to make decisions based on the evidence presented before them. The two court orders discussed above highlight the importance of evidence in determining the outcome of a case. It is essential to present strong evidence in court to support one's case and ensure that justice is served.
