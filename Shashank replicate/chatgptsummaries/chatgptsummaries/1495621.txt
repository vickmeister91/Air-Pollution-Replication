In a recent court order, the applicants who were facing charges under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Amendment Act 2003, 2006, have been granted bail. The applicants had been in jail since June 2008 and the charge-sheet had been filed against them. The court has ordered that the applicants are to be released on bail and are to execute a bond of Rs. 10,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount. The court has also imposed certain conditions that the applicants must follow, failing which appropriate action will be taken.

The first condition imposed by the court is that the applicants must not leave the state of Gujarat without prior permission of the concerned trial court. This condition has been imposed to ensure that the applicants do not flee from justice and are available for trial. The second condition is that the applicants must surrender their passport, if any, to the lower court within a week. This condition has been imposed to ensure that the applicants do not leave the country while the trial is ongoing.

The court has also warned the applicants that if any of the conditions imposed by the court are breached, appropriate action will be taken. This warning has been issued to ensure that the applicants comply with the conditions imposed by the court and do not violate them.

The court order is significant as it grants bail to the applicants who have been in jail for a long time. The court has taken into consideration the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed against the applicants and has granted them bail. The court has also imposed certain conditions to ensure that the applicants do not flee from justice and are available for trial.

In conclusion, the recent court order granting bail to the applicants who were facing charges under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Amendment Act 2003, 2006, is a significant development.
