The petitioners were accused of causing damage to naturally grown plants and trees by dumping debris and mud. However, the petitioners denied any involvement in the alleged act.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court found that the material collected by the police did not constitute any offense against the petitioners and quashed the case against them. The court also noted that the offenses alleged could not be vicariously made liable.

The case highlights the importance of proper investigation and evidence collection in criminal cases. In this instance, the court found that the evidence presented did not support the allegations against the petitioners, and therefore the case was dismissed.

It is also worth noting that the court emphasized the principle of vicarious liability, which holds that an employer can be held responsible for the actions of their employees. In this case, the court found that the offenses alleged could not be vicariously made liable, indicating that the petitioners were not responsible for the actions of others.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of due process and the need for proper evidence collection in criminal cases. It also highlights the principle of vicarious liability and the limitations of this concept in certain situations.
