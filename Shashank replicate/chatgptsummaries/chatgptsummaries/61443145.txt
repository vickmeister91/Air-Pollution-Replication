The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving brick kilns and the issuance of "no objection certificates" by the U.P. Pollution Control Board. In the first case, a petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, challenging the issuance of a "no objection certificate" to run a brick kiln in violation of statutory provisions and rules. The petitioner alleged that the brick kiln was situated within the prohibited distance from the abadi of village Mochwa, and school, grove land, and orchard were also situated within the prohibited distance. The court directed the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police to ensure that the brick kiln does not function at the place in question if the abadi land is situated less than 200 meters. The court also questioned the Board's grant of the "no objection certificate" despite the violation of rules and an earlier court order. The court relied on reports submitted by revenue authorities and a Tehsildar to conclude that the brick kiln was indeed situated within the prohibited distance.

In the second case, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had made an inspection and submitted a report, and an interim order was passed by the court. However, the appellate authority later found the certificate to be illegal and rejected it. The petitioner filed a contempt petition, and the court notes that orders were not complied with. The petitioner's counsel cites a relevant rule, and the court reproduces a letter from the Board regarding the certificate. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition as infructuous.

The third case involves the establishment of a brick kiln within a prohibited area. The court-appointed an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the area and found that the brick kiln was situated within the prohibited distance from residential areas and mango groves. The court also noted that the Board had issued a "no objection certificate" to the respondent to run the brick kiln, despite the dismissal of an appeal and the issuance of an earlier certificate. The court found that the establishment of the brick kiln violated rules and could cause pollution and health problems for citizens.

In the fourth case, the court order pertains to the harmful emissions from a brick kiln that can cause fatal diseases to humans. The court cites the fundamental right to inhale fresh air protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the principle of "polluter pay" as essential features of sustainable development. The court quashes the "no objection certificate" granted to the brick kiln and orders its immediate closure. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 5,00,000 on the respondents and directs them to deposit the amount.

In the fifth case, the court has ordered respondent no. 10 and 11 to deposit Rs. 3,00,000 and respondent no. 2 and 3 to deposit Rs. 2,00,000. The petitioner can withdraw Rs. 3,00,000 and the remaining Rs. 2,00,000 will be sent to the Mediation and Conciliation Center. If the cost is not deposited within two months, it will be recovered from the respondents. The Board's cost will be recovered from its employees responsible for issuing the second "no objection certificate" to respondent no. 10 and 11. The registry will take follow-up action. The order was given on December 20, 2013, by Justice Vishnu Chandra Gupta and Justice Devi Prasad Singh.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following statutory provisions and rules when it comes to the establishment and operation of brick kilns. The court has taken a strong stance against the issuance of "no objection certificates" in violation of rules and has ordered the closure of brick kilns that pose a threat to public health and the environment. The court has also imposed costs on respondents and directed them to deposit the amount, emphasizing the principle of "polluter pay" and holding individuals and organizations accountable for their actions.
