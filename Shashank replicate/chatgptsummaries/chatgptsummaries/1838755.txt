In the case of Pranab Kumar Roy vs State And Anr., the petitioner has requested the court to set aside an order and quash a complaint that led to a criminal case being registered against him for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The complainant had filed a petition under Section 50(4) of the Act, alleging that the petitioner was unlawfully carrying/transporting some Schedule I wild life articles. The petitioner was taken into custody, and the complainant filed a fresh complaint on June 6, 2003, which led to a new case being started.

The court found that the second complaint was not maintainable, as the first complaint had already been acted upon, and quashed it. However, the court allowed the respondents to proceed on the basis of the first complaint. This means that the petitioner will still have to face the charges brought against him in the first complaint.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal listed in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act. It also regulates the trade in wildlife and their products.

In this case, the petitioner was accused of violating the Act by carrying/transporting Schedule I wildlife articles. Schedule I of the Act includes animals such as tigers, lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses, which are considered to be endangered species.

The court's decision to quash the second complaint was based on the principle of double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is a legal principle that prohibits a person from being tried twice for the same offense. In this case, the court found that the second complaint was based on the same facts and allegations as the first complaint, and therefore, the petitioner could not be tried again for the same offense.

However, the court's decision to allow the respondents to proceed on the basis of the first complaint means that the petitioner will still have to face the charges brought against him in the first complaint. The court did not find any grounds to quash the first complaint, and therefore, the case will proceed based on the allegations made in the first complaint.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following laws and regulations aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats. It also emphasizes the need for proper legal procedures to be followed when enforcing these laws, to ensure that individuals are not unfairly targeted or punished.
