The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Amstar Lyngdoh and local people of Shillong to protect the ecology of Shillong. The petition seeks a mandamus to stop all activities, including construction, in the Lawsohtun area and restore the forest to its pre-1998 status. The forest is a critical catchment area of Shillong and the destruction of the forest cover has caused widespread public resentment.

The court notes that the Khasi tribal community has a unique social system, and the existence of the forest is a part of their identity. The court also notes that the Army authorities have encroached on the forest land and are dumping waste, polluting the sources of springs, rivulets, and streams. The court orders the respondent No. 2 to be restrained from carrying on their construction activities in the forest to prevent irreparable loss to the water catchment area of Shillong.

The court order pertains to a petition filed by Shri K. Swer, President of Raid Laban, regarding the ecological balance in the catchment area at Lawsohtun. The court has asked the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest Meghalaya to meet with the President of Raid Laban or depute a suitable officer for spot inspection and submit a report at the earliest.

The order also includes affidavits filed by respondent No. 2, Union of India, and respondent No. 1, stating that the land in question belongs to the Army authority and has not been declared a catchment area. The petitioner argues that the construction of 707 Dwelling Units by the Army authority would result in the felling of 1445 trees and adversely affect the ecology and catchment area.

The court cites Article 51(A)(g) of the Constitution of India, which enjoins citizens to protect and improve the natural environment, and directs the court to examine whether appropriate considerations are borne in mind and irrelevancies excluded.

The court order states that the court has the power to examine whether appropriate considerations are being taken into account and irrelevant factors are being excluded. The court may give necessary directions in appropriate cases.

The court has received a report stating that the Army has not caused deforestation in the area and that the land fenced and occupied by the Army was once barren but has since been afforested. However, the court is not convinced that the Army has not felled any trees for the purpose of construction.

The court also notes that it is the duty of the Advisory Board to take up the matter for the protection of catchment areas in the state of Meghalaya. Therefore, the Advisory Board will sit and take a decision as to whether the Lawsohtun area should be declared as a catchment area or not.

If the decision is made that the area falls within the definition of catchment area, the State Government shall issue a notification to that effect and take measures for protection of catchment area as per the provisions of Act 1990. No construction work shall be carried out by the Army authority in the area in question during this period.
