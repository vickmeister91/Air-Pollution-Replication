The High Court of Punjab and Haryana recently passed a judgment in a case filed by M/s Som Furniture and another, seeking the quashing of a criminal complaint filed against them by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee. The court considered the maintainability of the petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and observed that while there is no limit on the powers of the court under this section, the power of quashing criminal proceedings should be exercised very sparingly in the rarest of rare cases.

The petitioners had argued that the criminal complaint filed against them was without any basis and that the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee had not followed the due process of law while initiating the proceedings. They had also contended that the complaint was filed with mala fide intentions and that it was an abuse of the process of law.

The court, however, did not find merit in the petitioners' arguments and dismissed the petition. The court observed that the allegations made in the complaint were serious in nature and that they required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the petitioners had not been able to establish that the complaint was filed with mala fide intentions or that it was an abuse of the process of law.

The court further observed that the power of quashing criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be exercised very sparingly and only in exceptional cases. The court noted that the power of quashing criminal proceedings is an extraordinary power and that it should be used only in cases where the allegations made in the complaint are manifestly absurd, frivolous, or vexatious.

The court also granted the petitioners the liberty to avail the remedy of filing a revision petition before the Court of Sessions under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court observed that the petitioners could challenge the order passed by the Magistrate in the revision petition and that the Court of Sessions would have the power to examine the entire case afresh.

In conclusion, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dismissed the petition filed by M/s Som Furniture and another seeking the quashing of a criminal complaint filed against them by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee. The court observed that the power of quashing criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be exercised very sparingly and only in exceptional cases. The court granted the petitioners the liberty to avail the remedy of filing a revision petition before the Court of Sessions under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
