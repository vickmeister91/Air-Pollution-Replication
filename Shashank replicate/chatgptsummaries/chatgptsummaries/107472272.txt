The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by Babulal Surana against T.P. Selva Rayan (deceased), S. Thomkas Rayan, Mrs. Rajamani, and Mrs. Jacklean. The petitioner sought to set aside an order made by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Valllioor, in C.C.No.236 of 2006, which dismissed the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The petitioner had filed the application to send for some documents from the Income Tax Department to know whether the lending of money had been mentioned in the Income Tax returns. The court dismissed the petition, finding no merit in it, and directed the learned Judicial Magistrate, Valllioor, to dispose of the case on merits and as per law within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order.

The case at hand involves allegations of financial impropriety and the lending of money without proper documentation. The petitioner, Babulal Surana, had sought to obtain documents from the Income Tax Department to determine whether the lending of money had been mentioned in the Income Tax returns. However, the court found no merit in the petitioner's application and dismissed it.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the lending of money had not been mentioned in the Income Tax returns. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the lending of money had been done without proper documentation.

As a result, the court directed the learned Judicial Magistrate, Valllioor, to dispose of the case on merits and as per law within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. This means that the case will now proceed to trial, where the parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of their respective positions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support one's claims in a court of law. Without such evidence, it is unlikely that a court will rule in one's favor. Additionally, the court's decision underscores the importance of proper documentation when it comes to financial transactions, as the lack of such documentation can lead to legal disputes and other complications.
