The court orders mentioned in this summary all pertain to cases related to dowry demand and cruelty against women. The first court order is related to a criminal appeal filed by Ashok against the State Public Prosecutor for a judgment passed in 2004. Ashok was accused of subjecting his wife to cruelty and driving her to commit suicide. He was also accused of demanding dowry and committing an offense punishable under Section 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately acquitted Ashok of all charges except for the offense punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The court also noted that demanding money for expenses and purchases cannot be considered dowry unless it is proven to be a demand for dowry.

The second court order states that the accused demanded and accepted a sum of Rs. 80,000 as dowry for his marriage with the deceased. The charge was framed against the accused under Sections 3, 4, and 6 of the D.P. Act. The court found the evidence on record to be sufficient for conviction and dismissed the appeal. The court also noted that the deceased had suffered burn injuries and died due to them. The mother of the deceased testified that the accused had demanded gold or money for the marriage negotiations and had harassed her daughter. The court found the accused guilty of the offense punishable under Sections 3, 4, and 6 of the D.P. Act.

The third court order pertains to a case of dowry demand and death of the bride. The prosecution presented evidence that the accused and his family members had demanded money before the marriage on the pretext of securing a job for the accused. The prosecution also presented evidence that a sum of Rs. 60,000 had been received by the accused's family through a DD. The accused did not explain what happened to the money and did not deny receiving it. The court inferred that the accused had received the money and was responsible for the dowry demand.

The fourth court order pertains to a case where the appellant was accused of not returning Rs. 28,60,000 to the deceased's family after the latter's death. The court found the prosecution's evidence to be successful in proving the appellant guilty under Sections 3, 4, and 6 of the D.P. Act. However, the court found the sentence of 3 years imprisonment to be too harsh and reduced it. The defense argued that the appellant has a five-year-old son and is responsible for taking care of him after the death of the deceased.
