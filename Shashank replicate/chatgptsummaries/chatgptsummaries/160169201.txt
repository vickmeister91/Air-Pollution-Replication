Three individuals, Rashisnath, Shaijalnath, and Lakadnath, who were in custody since September 29, 2017, for the offence punishable under Section 39, 48(ka), and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, were granted bail by the court. The applicants were accused of possessing a black cobra and a snake with two mouths. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act aims to protect the wildlife and their habitats, and to prevent the extinction of species.

The accused in this case were found to be in possession of a black cobra and a snake with two mouths, which are protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The possession of such animals is a punishable offence under the act. The court granted bail to the accused without commenting on the merits of the case, which means that the court did not express any opinion on the guilt or innocence of the accused.

The court directed the accused to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned court. This means that the accused have to provide a guarantee that they will appear before the court on the dates given by the court, and if they fail to do so, the bail amount will be forfeited.

Bail is a legal process that allows an accused to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused will appear before the court on the dates given by the court. Bail is granted when the court is satisfied that the accused will not abscond or tamper with the evidence.

In this case, the court granted bail to the accused as they were in custody for a considerable period, and the court did not find any reason to keep them in custody any longer. The court did not comment on the merits of the case, which means that the court did not express any opinion on the guilt or innocence of the accused.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to Rashisnath, Shaijalnath, and Lakadnath, who were in custody since September 29, 2017, for the offence punishable under Section 39, 48(ka), and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused were found to be in possession of a black cobra and a snake with two mouths, which are protected under the act. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and directed the accused to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned court.
