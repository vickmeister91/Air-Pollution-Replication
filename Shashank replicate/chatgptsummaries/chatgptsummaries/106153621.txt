The Himachal Pradesh High Court has directed the Department of Tourism to geo-tag and flag public conveniences on Google maps to help the general public know the place and type of conveniences available. The Managing Director of Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation has been directed to have this done immediately. The court has also suggested the installation of a map server with the involvement of AGISAC to create data and consumption of essential data of such information. The Principal Secretary, Department of Environment, Science and Technology and Additional Chief Secretary, Tourism, to the Government of Himachal Pradesh have been directed to explore the possibility of having such server installed in the State of Himachal Pradesh at the earliest. The cost of setting up the server can be recovered from all the industrial units/establishments/hotels functional and operational in the State of Himachal Pradesh, perhaps also from the advertisers who may be called upon to advertise.

The court order is a significant step towards improving the tourism infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh. The geo-tagging and flagging of public conveniences on Google maps will help tourists and locals alike to locate and access public conveniences easily. This will be particularly useful for tourists who are not familiar with the area and may have difficulty finding public conveniences. The installation of a map server with the involvement of AGISAC will also be a significant step towards creating a comprehensive database of tourism infrastructure in the state.

The court order also highlights the need for the involvement of the government in improving tourism infrastructure in the state. The Principal Secretary, Department of Environment, Science and Technology and Additional Chief Secretary, Tourism, to the Government of Himachal Pradesh have been directed to explore the possibility of having a map server installed in the state at the earliest. This shows that the government is committed to improving tourism infrastructure in the state and is willing to take steps to achieve this goal.

The court order also suggests that the cost of setting up the server can be recovered from all the industrial units/establishments/hotels functional and operational in the State of Himachal Pradesh, perhaps also from the advertisers who may be called upon to advertise. This is a significant step towards ensuring that the burden of improving tourism infrastructure is not borne solely by the government. By involving the private sector in this process, the government can ensure that the cost of improving tourism infrastructure is shared by all stakeholders.

Overall, the court order is a significant step towards improving tourism infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh. The geo-tagging and flagging of public conveniences on Google maps will make it easier for tourists and locals to access public conveniences, while the installation of a map server with the involvement of AGISAC will create a comprehensive database of tourism infrastructure in the state. The involvement of the government and private sector in this process will ensure that the burden of improving tourism infrastructure is shared by all stakeholders. The next hearing is scheduled for January 3, 2018, and it will be interesting to see the progress made towards implementing the court order.
