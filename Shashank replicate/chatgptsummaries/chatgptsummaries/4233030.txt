The court order in question pertains to a repeat bail application filed by Surajlal, also known as Guddu, under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in connection with Forest Crime No.11857/2001. Guddu is accused of hunting a big cat and is being held for offences punishable under Sections 2 (I) (20)(36), 48(A), 49(A)(aa), 49(B), 50 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court dismissed the bail application, stating that there was no change in circumstances since the earlier application was rejected and no case was made out for grant of bail. This decision was based on the fact that Guddu had already filed a bail application in the past, which was rejected due to lack of evidence and the seriousness of the charges against him. The court found that there was no new evidence or change in circumstances that would warrant a different outcome this time around.

The charges against Guddu are serious and carry significant penalties under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Section 2 (I) (20)(36) of the Act defines "hunting" as capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring, or trapping any wild animal, and Section 48(A) provides for imprisonment for a term of three to seven years and a fine of up to Rs. 10,000 for hunting in a sanctuary or national park. Sections 49(A)(aa), 49(B), 50 and 51 provide for additional penalties for offences such as possession of wildlife trophies, trading in wildlife, and abetting or attempting to commit an offence under the Act.

Given the severity of the charges against Guddu and the lack of new evidence or change in circumstances, the court's decision to deny bail is not surprising. The court's decision is in line with the principles of justice and fairness, as it ensures that Guddu will remain in custody until his trial, which will allow for a fair and impartial determination of his guilt or innocence.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny bail to Surajlal @ Guddu in connection with Forest Crime No.11857/2001 is based on the lack of new evidence or change in circumstances since his earlier bail application was rejected. The charges against Guddu are serious and carry significant penalties under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court's decision is in line with the principles of justice and fairness, as it ensures that Guddu will remain in custody until his trial, which will allow for a fair and impartial determination of his guilt or innocence.
