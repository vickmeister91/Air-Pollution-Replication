The Madras High Court recently disposed of a petition filed by a concerned citizen regarding the welfare of elephants during festivals and processions. The petitioner had sought a direction from the authorities to prevent the parading of elephants between 11 am and 5 pm and to prosecute offenders who violate the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The respondents, which included the Tamil Nadu government, the Animal Welfare Board of India, and the Chief Wildlife Warden, filed a detailed statement and issued circulars to prevent cruelty to elephants.

The court noted that the respondents had taken sufficient safeguards to prevent cruelty to elephants during festivals and processions. The court also observed that the petitioner could approach the District Collector for redressal of grievances. The court disposed of the petition, stating that it was satisfied with the measures taken by the respondents.

However, the court allowed an application for impleading additional respondents and reserved liberty to them to question the correctness of a circular dated 1.3.2008. The circular in question pertained to the use of elephants in processions and festivals.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the need for the welfare of animals during festivals and processions. Elephants are often used in such events, and there have been instances of cruelty towards them. The court's decision sends a message that such cruelty will not be tolerated and that measures must be taken to ensure the welfare of animals.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, which provides for the protection of wild animals and birds and their habitats. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and capturing of wild animals and birds and provides for their conservation and management.

The court's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the welfare of animals and upholding the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. It is hoped that such measures will be taken in other parts of the country as well to prevent cruelty towards animals during festivals and processions.
