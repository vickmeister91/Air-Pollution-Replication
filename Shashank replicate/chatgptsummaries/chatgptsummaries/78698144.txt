The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Dharmveer under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Amended Act. The applicant's counsel argued that another accused, Yaduveer Singh, who faced identical allegations, had been granted bail by the court. The court allowed the application, directing the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and a surety in the same amount to appear before the court on the given dates. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but it will become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The Wild Life Protection Act and the Amended Act are laws that aim to protect wildlife and their habitats. These laws prohibit the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, as well as the destruction of their habitats. Violations of these laws can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Dharmveer was accused of violating these laws, and had filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. This section allows a person who has been arrested for a non-bailable offence to apply for bail. The court may grant bail if it is satisfied that the accused will not abscond or tamper with evidence, and that their release will not be detrimental to the interests of justice.

Dharmveer's counsel argued that another accused, Yaduveer Singh, who faced identical allegations, had been granted bail by the court. This argument is based on the principle of parity, which means that similarly situated individuals should be treated equally under the law. If one person has been granted bail, then another person facing identical allegations should also be granted bail.

The court accepted this argument and allowed Dharmveer's bail application. The court directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and a surety in the same amount to appear before the court on the given dates. A personal bond is a promise made by the accused to appear before the court on the given dates, and to comply with any other conditions imposed by the court. A surety is a person who promises to pay the bail amount if the accused fails to appear before the court.

The court also made it clear that the order will remain effective until the end of the trial. This means that Dharmveer will be released on bail, but he will have to appear before the court on the given dates and comply with any other conditions imposed by the court. If he fails to do so, the bail order will become ineffective, and he may be arrested again.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Dharmveer under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Amended Act. The court allowed the application, directing the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and a surety in the same amount to appear before the court on the given dates. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but it will become ineffective in case of bail jump. The court's decision was based on the principle of parity, which means that similarly situated individuals should be treated equally under the law.
