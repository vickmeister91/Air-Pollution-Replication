In 2005, the Kerala High Court issued a court order directing the Perumatty Grama Panchayat to renew the license of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages and take necessary action against the respondents. The court found that the Panchayat had no legal authority to cancel the license and directed them to consider the application for renewal of the license. The Panchayat had rejected the application despite the petitioner possessing all necessary approvals and licenses.

The court directed the Licensing Authority to renew the license within one week and ordered the Pollution Control Board to inspect the premises of the factory after it commences functioning. If the license is not issued within the prescribed time, the petitioner can carry on the functioning of the company subject to restrictions.

The court order was issued in response to a petition filed by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages, challenging the cancellation of its license by the Perumatty Grama Panchayat. The petitioner argued that the cancellation was illegal and arbitrary, and that it had complied with all the necessary regulations and requirements.

The court agreed with the petitioner and held that the Panchayat had no legal authority to cancel the license. The court also noted that the petitioner had obtained all necessary approvals and licenses from the relevant authorities, and that there was no reason to deny the renewal of the license.

The court directed the Licensing Authority to renew the license within one week, and ordered the Pollution Control Board to inspect the premises of the factory after it commences functioning. The court also directed the Panchayat to take necessary action against the respondents who had cancelled the license without any legal authority.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rule of law and ensures that the petitioner's rights are protected. The court's decision also sends a strong message to local authorities that they cannot act arbitrarily and must follow the law and due process.

The court's direction to the Pollution Control Board to inspect the premises of the factory after it commences functioning is also important as it ensures that the petitioner complies with all necessary environmental regulations and standards.

Overall, the court order is a victory for the petitioner and a reminder to local authorities that they must act within the bounds of the law and respect the rights of individuals and companies.
