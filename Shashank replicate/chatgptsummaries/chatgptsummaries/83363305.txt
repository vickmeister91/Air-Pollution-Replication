The petitioner sought the release of a vehicle that had been seized by the Forest Department in connection with an offence registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner also filed an application for interim custody of the vehicle.

However, the court rejected both the petition and the application for interim custody. The reason for this was that confiscation proceedings had already been initiated against the seized vehicle. The vehicle in question had been involved in the illegal transportation of sand that belonged to the Forest Department.

The court noted that the offence was a serious one and that the vehicle had been used in the commission of the offence.

In light of these factors, the court dismissed the petition and the application for interim custody.
