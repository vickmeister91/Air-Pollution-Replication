The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitions were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, claiming relief from demand notices issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities.

The controversy involves the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders had deposited the compensation amount, while the rest either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioners argued that they were being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and for the common area, which is being utilized by the cluster members. The respondents argued that the present status of the diverted cluster showed that only 42 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and 36.9173 hectares of forest area were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed.

The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and made a decision on the legality of the demand notice. The petitioner, along with 63 other mining lease holders, deposited a sum of Rs.8,79,53,196/- on a pro-rata basis at the rate of Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare on 25.10.2017 under protest with the Mining Department. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment.

The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and thus, the approval was given for the entire area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra), and also such computation shall include the common areas of transport as well as the area being utilized for storing their machines and equipments and other infrastructure, which includes offices and houses of workers etc., constructed on the said area, along with the dumping area which constitutes a part of the 281 hectare cluster area, but shall specifically exclude the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, for which appropriate relinquishment proceedings shall be pursued by the Mining Department.

The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs.17,59,06,000/- for the extension of the period of diversion proposal. Out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

In conclusion, the court order deals with multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and made a decision on the legality of the demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N.
