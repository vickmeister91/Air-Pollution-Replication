Jeevan and Hukum, who are accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act by possessing leopard skin, have had their repeat bail application denied by the court. The court has directed the trial court to expedite the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments. The order also mentions that the accused's first bail application was dismissed earlier.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The possession of leopard skin is a violation of the act and is punishable by imprisonment and a fine.

Jeevan and Hukum were arrested for possessing leopard skin and were subsequently denied bail. They filed a repeat bail application, which has now been denied by the court. The court has directed the trial court to expedite the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments. This is a significant development in the case, as it indicates that the court is taking a strict stance on wildlife protection.

The court's decision to deny bail to Jeevan and Hukum is in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The act provides for stringent punishment for those who violate its provisions. The possession of leopard skin is a serious offense, as it indicates that the accused were involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products.

The court's order to expedite the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments is also significant. It indicates that the court is aware of the importance of timely justice delivery in cases related to wildlife protection. The illegal trade of wildlife products is a serious threat to the survival of many species, and timely justice delivery is crucial in curbing this trade.

The court's order also mentions that the accused's first bail application was dismissed earlier. This indicates that the court has already considered the bail application once and has found it to be without merit. The repeat bail application filed by the accused is therefore unlikely to be successful.

In conclusion, the court's order to deny bail to Jeevan and Hukum and to expedite the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments is a significant development in the case. It indicates that the court is taking a strict stance on wildlife protection and is aware of the importance of timely justice delivery in cases related to wildlife protection. The accused's repeat bail application has been denied, and the trial court has been directed to expedite the trial. The court's order is in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act and is a step towards curbing the illegal trade of wildlife products.
