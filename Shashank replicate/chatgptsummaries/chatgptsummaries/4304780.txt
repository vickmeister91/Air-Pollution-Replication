In a recent court order, an application for anticipatory bail filed by Raj Bahoran was rejected under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. The applicant was apprehending his arrest for the offences punishable under Sections 9, 39 in connection with Crime No.99/201550, 51 and 52 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 registered at Police Station Forest Officer/Sub Forest Officer, District Sidhi(M.P.).

The court carefully examined the facts and circumstances of the case and found no case for grant of anticipatory bail. The court observed that the offences alleged against the applicant were serious in nature and the investigation was still ongoing. The court also noted that the applicant had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to provide any concrete evidence to support his claim of innocence.

The court further observed that the purpose of anticipatory bail was to protect a person from arrest in a false or frivolous case, and not to shield a person from the consequences of his actions. The court emphasized that the grant of anticipatory bail should be an exception rather than the rule, and should only be granted in exceptional circumstances.

In this case, the court found that there were no exceptional circumstances that warranted the grant of anticipatory bail. The court noted that the applicant had not been able to establish any grounds for his apprehension of arrest, and that the investigation was still ongoing. The court also observed that the applicant had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to provide any concrete evidence to support his claim of innocence.

In light of these observations, the court rejected the application for anticipatory bail filed by Raj Bahoran. The court emphasized that the grant of anticipatory bail should not be used as a tool to evade the law, and that the law should take its course in accordance with the facts and circumstances of each case.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of cooperation with the investigation and the need for exceptional circumstances to warrant the grant of anticipatory bail. It also emphasizes the need for the law to take its course in accordance with the facts and circumstances of each case, and for the grant of anticipatory bail to be an exception rather than the rule.
