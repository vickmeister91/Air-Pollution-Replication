The Bombay High Court recently disposed of a writ petition that challenged an order passed by the Member Secretary under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court held that the petitioner may resort to the statutory remedy provided under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and disposed of the writ petition with liberty.

The case involved a challenge to an order passed by the Member Secretary under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner had argued that the order was arbitrary and illegal, and had sought relief from the court. However, the court held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and that the writ petition was therefore not maintainable.

The court's decision was based on the principle of alternative remedies, which holds that a petitioner must exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. In this case, the court found that the petitioner had not exhausted the remedy available under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore could not approach the court for relief.

The court's decision is significant because it reinforces the importance of alternative remedies in the Indian legal system. It also highlights the need for petitioners to carefully consider all available remedies before approaching the court, as failure to do so may result in the dismissal of their case.

Overall, the Bombay High Court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of alternative remedies in the Indian legal system, and underscores the need for petitioners to carefully consider all available remedies before approaching the court.
