The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Dulichand Patidar, who is accused of various offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicant on certain conditions.

The first condition is the furnishing of a personal bond and sureties. This means that Patidar must provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he will comply with the conditions of his bail. He must also provide one or more individuals who will act as sureties, meaning that they will be responsible for ensuring that Patidar complies with the conditions of his bail.

The second condition is cooperation in the investigation/trial. This means that Patidar must cooperate fully with the authorities in their investigation of the charges against him. He must also attend all court hearings related to his case.

The third condition is marking of presence at the police station every fifteen days. This means that Patidar must report to the police station every fifteen days to confirm that he is complying with the conditions of his bail.

The court has made it clear that these conditions must be strictly adhered to. Failure to comply with any of these conditions could result in the revocation of Patidar's bail and his return to custody.

It is important to note that the court order is to be sent to the concerned court for compliance. This means that the court that is handling Patidar's case will be responsible for ensuring that he complies with the conditions of his bail.

Overall, this court order represents a significant development in the case against Dulichand Patidar. While he has been granted bail, he must comply with a number of strict conditions in order to remain free. It remains to be seen how Patidar will respond to these conditions and whether he will ultimately be found guilty of the charges against him.
