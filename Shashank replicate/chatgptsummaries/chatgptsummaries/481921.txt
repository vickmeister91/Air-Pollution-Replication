The Orissa High Court received a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India from the inhabitants of village Dungura and its nearby villages situated in the district of Balasore. The petitioners were aggrieved by the permission accorded by the Collector, Balasore to opposite party No. 6 for installing and operating a 'Stone Crusher Unit' within a thickly populated village area, without taking note of the environmental hazards and consequential damage to the crops which may be caused due to installation and operation of the said Stone Crusher.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed conflicting opinions regarding the topographical situation of the proposed Crusher Unit. The court did not make a final decision in the summary provided. However, the court order pertains to a petition regarding the installation of a crusher unit in an area that could potentially harm human health and agriculture.

The court has directed the Collector to consider whether permission can be granted for the installation of the unit at the suggested site, and a high-level committee consisting of experts should conduct an inquiry at the spot. The State Pollution Control Board should also depute a responsible officer to take part in the inquiry. The permission to establish the unit is subject to the result of the inquiry. The entire exercise should be completed within three months of communication of this order.
