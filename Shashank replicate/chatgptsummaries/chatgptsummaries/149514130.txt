In a recent court case, K. Nagarajan filed a petition to condone the delay of 122 days in filing a criminal revision against an order passed by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner claimed that he was suffering from jaundice and family problems, which prevented him from contacting his counsel and obtaining a copy of the order. The respondent, C. Arasukumar, argued that the delay was not properly explained and lacked bona fides.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that lack of bona fides attributable to a party praying for condonation of delay is a relevant and significant fact. The court also noted that the main case was posted for cross-examination and dismissed the petition to prevent an aberration of justice and promote the cause of justice.

The petitioner's argument that he was suffering from jaundice and family problems was not enough to justify the delay in filing the criminal revision. The court noted that the petitioner did not provide any medical records or other evidence to support his claim of jaundice. Additionally, the petitioner did not provide any details about his family problems or how they prevented him from contacting his counsel and obtaining a copy of the order.

The respondent argued that the delay lacked bona fides, meaning that the petitioner did not have a genuine reason for the delay. The court agreed with the respondent, noting that the petitioner did not provide any evidence to support his claim of jaundice or family problems. The court also noted that the petitioner did not explain why he did not contact his counsel or obtain a copy of the order during the 122-day delay.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that lack of bona fides is a relevant and significant fact when considering a request for condonation of delay. The court also noted that the main case was posted for cross-examination, meaning that delaying the criminal revision could cause an aberration of justice. By dismissing the petition, the court was promoting the cause of justice and preventing any potential harm to the main case.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petition to condone the delay in filing a criminal revision was based on the lack of bona fides and the potential harm to the main case. The petitioner's claim of jaundice and family problems was not enough to justify the delay, as he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. The court's decision was in the interest of promoting justice and preventing any potential harm to the main case.
