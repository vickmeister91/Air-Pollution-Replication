The court order pertains to a case where the appellant claimed damages of Rs. 3,25,000/- for injuries sustained due to electric shock. The court below decreed the suit for an amount of Rs. 35,000/- only as compensation to be realized from the respondents/defendants. The appellant was dissatisfied with the impugned decree and judgment and has come up in appeal.

The court held that the respondents are liable to compensate the appellant under the principle of strict liability laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher. The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher has been applied in India by almost all the Civil Courts, High Courts, and the Apex Court. The principle of strict liability holds that a person who keeps hazardous or inherently dangerous substances or engages in hazardous activities is liable for any harm caused to others, even if they have taken all reasonable precautions to prevent such harm.

The court order discusses the principle of strict liability in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, as established in previous cases. The court finds that the defendant in this case is liable for damages, even if no negligence is attributed to them, and orders them to pay compensation to the plaintiff for their injuries sustained in an electric shock incident.

The court calculates the amount of compensation based on the plaintiff's age, occupation, disability, and loss of earnings, and orders the defendant to pay a total of Rs. 91,250 with interest and costs. The court also orders the defendant to pay the court fees.

The court's decision is based on the principle of strict liability, which holds that a person who engages in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities is liable for any harm caused to others, even if they have taken all reasonable precautions to prevent such harm.

The court's decision is also based on the principle of compensation, which holds that a person who has suffered harm should be compensated for their losses. The court calculates the amount of compensation based on the plaintiff's age, occupation, disability, and loss of earnings, and orders the defendant to pay this amount with interest and costs.
