The Kerala High Court recently issued two court orders related to the construction of resorts in the coastal zone of Kerala. The first case involved a resort owner who approached the court seeking relief from the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority and the Kottukkal Grama Panchayath. The petitioner requested that they not disturb any huts constructed by the petitioner in the 75 cents of properties in which Aazhimala Beach resorts is constructed, with valid permission and permits. The main issue in this case was compliance with the Zoning Regulations under the Environment Protection Act, as the area where the petitioner's resort is situated comes within the CRZ II category.

The court found that the petitioner's constructions were within 200 meters of the High Tide Line, and therefore, the petitioner's constructions should be removed. The court cited a previous judgment that had become final and directed the 1st respondent to take appropriate action. The court order stated that the petitioner's constructions were found to be in violation of the regulations and were liable to be demolished.

In the second case, the court order stated that a demarcation was carried out in the presence of the petitioner and other respondents, and the High Court has directed the second respondent to demolish the building in the prohibited area within one month. If they fail to do so, the third respondent will demolish it. The petitioner's constructions were found to be within the prohibited area of 200 meters from the High Tide Line, and therefore, they were liable to be demolished. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that there was no merit in it.

The court's decision in both cases was based on the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, which regulates activities in the coastal zone. The notification divides the coastal zone into four categories, with different regulations for each category. The CRZ II category, where the petitioner's resort was situated, allows for only certain activities, such as fishing and traditional coastal activities. Construction of buildings, including resorts, is not allowed in this category.

The court's decision to demolish the constructions was based on the fact that they were in violation of the regulations and were within the prohibited area of 200 meters from the High Tide Line. The High Tide Line is the line on the land up to which the highest water line reaches during the spring tide. The court's decision was in line with the objective of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, which is to protect the coastal environment and prevent its degradation.

The court's decision has important implications for the construction of resorts and other buildings in the coastal zone. It underscores the need for strict compliance with the regulations and the importance of protecting the coastal environment. The court's decision also highlights the need for effective enforcement of the regulations to prevent violations and ensure that the coastal zone is protected for future generations.
