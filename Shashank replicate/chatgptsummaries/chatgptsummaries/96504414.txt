The case of Karam Singh, who sought the quashing of orders suspending his 'No Objection Certificate' for installation of a retail outlet in village Shergarh, District Kaithal, was heard in court. The certificate was suspended on the grounds that the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited had not obtained permission from the Government of India for the use of forest land and that the Completion Certificate had not been received from the National Highway Authority. The petitioner argued that the necessary permissions had been obtained and that the suspension order should be revoked.

The court directed the District Magistrate, Kaithal, to consider the petitioner's representations for revocation of the suspension of the 'No Objection Certificate' in the light of a Division Bench judgment and dispose of the same within two months. This decision was made in accordance with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing and that decisions be made based on the evidence presented.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided evidence that the necessary permissions had been obtained and that the suspension order was therefore unjustified. The court also noted that the suspension order had caused significant financial hardship to the petitioner, who had invested a substantial amount of money in the project.

The court's decision was a victory for the petitioner, who had been unfairly targeted by the suspension order. The court's decision also serves as a reminder that all parties must be given a fair hearing and that decisions must be made based on the evidence presented.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Karam Singh serves as an important reminder of the principles of natural justice and the importance of giving all parties a fair hearing. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented and was a victory for the petitioner, who had been unfairly targeted by the suspension order. The court's decision also serves as a warning to other authorities that they must act fairly and in accordance with the law when making decisions that affect the rights of individuals.
