The court order in question relates to a case involving two lecturers who were appointed on an honorarium basis under a government order in 1998. These lecturers had been serving in their positions for several years when, in 2006, a provision for the absorption and regulation of honorarium lecturers was added to the relevant act. Despite this provision, the services of the two lecturers were terminated in 2014.

In response to this termination, the two lecturers filed a case in court seeking relief. The court has now issued an order staying the termination and directing the competent authority to consider their case for regularization in the light of the provisions of Section 31(E) and a previous court ruling.

The court's decision to stay the termination order is significant as it provides the two lecturers with some measure of relief and protection. It also highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the relevant laws and regulations when making decisions about the employment status of individuals.

The court's direction to the competent authority to consider the case for regularization is also noteworthy. This suggests that the court believes that the two lecturers may be entitled to regularization under the provisions of Section 31(E) and that their case should be given due consideration.

It is important to note that the court's order does not automatically entitle the two lecturers to regularization. Rather, it directs the competent authority to consider their case in light of the relevant provisions and previous court rulings. The final decision on regularization will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific circumstances of the case and the interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.

Overall, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the relevant laws and regulations when making decisions about the employment status of individuals. It also underscores the need for individuals to be aware of their rights and to seek legal recourse when those rights are violated.
