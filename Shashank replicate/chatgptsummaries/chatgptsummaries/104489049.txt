The court order in question relates to a complaint filed by the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the respondent. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents from the bank to prove his case, which was disallowed by the JMFC. The court has allowed the petitioner's application for stay on trial proceedings until the disposal of the petition and issued notice to the respondent.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 deals with the dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable and punished with imprisonment or a fine, or both. In this case, the petitioner had filed a complaint against the respondent for dishonouring a cheque.

To prove his case, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents from the bank. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. However, the JMFC had disallowed the petitioner's application, which led to the petitioner filing a petition in the court.

The court has now allowed the petitioner's application for stay on trial proceedings until the disposal of the petition. This means that the trial proceedings will be put on hold until the court decides on the petitioner's petition. The court has also issued notice to the respondent, which means that the respondent will have to appear before the court and respond to the petitioner's petition.

The case has been listed for further proceedings on 28.06.2016. This means that the court will hear the case on this date and decide on the petitioner's petition. It is important to note that the court has not made any decision on the merits of the case at this stage. The court has only allowed the petitioner's application for stay on trial proceedings and issued notice to the respondent.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a complaint filed by the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the respondent. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents from the bank to prove his case, which was disallowed by the JMFC. The court has allowed the petitioner's application for stay on trial proceedings until the disposal of the petition and issued notice to the respondent. The case has been listed for further proceedings on 28.06.2016.
