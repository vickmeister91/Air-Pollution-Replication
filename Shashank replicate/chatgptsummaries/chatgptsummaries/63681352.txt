The Delhi District Court issued an award in a case between M/s Rodex Rubber Factory and Krantikari General Mazdoor Union. The workmen claimed that they were terminated illegally and unjustifiably by the management, while the management argued that the workmen remained absent despite personal messages, letters, show cause memos, and charge sheets. The court found that the termination of the workmen was illegal and ordered their reinstatement with full back wages and cost of litigation.

The court order states that M/s Rodex Rubber Factory is now known as M/s Black Stone Automobile Pvt. Ltd. and has been closed down since June 1, 2006, due to unavoidable circumstances under the provision of Section 31(A) of the Air Prevention & Control of Pollution Act, 1981. The workmen Bhola Singh, Harender, Navin, Arjun Singh, Dinesh, Rajender Master, Radhey Shyam, Suresh Yadav, and Sita Ram have settled their disputes with the management amicably under Section 18(1) of the ID Act. The management denies allegations made by the workmen and seeks dismissal of the claim. The court has framed five issues to be addressed and the workmen have examined 14 witnesses. During arguments, it is argued that the factory is not closed, the management had conceded to the visit of the Labour Inspector, and that there is an FIR.

The court order states that the management did not appear before the conciliation authorities and that they were not in the habit of issuing appointment letters or reflecting the names of employees in the attendance register. The management had appointed 30 employees only at the intervention of the labour department in 1996, and the documents relied upon by the management were found to be fabricated. The management had not issued any notice or letters calling upon the workmen to join their duties. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined the evidence presented. The court found that only 14 workmen had remained absent despite letters from the management, and the management had not terminated their services or obstructed them from joining their duties. The court also found that the management had not properly served the charge sheet to the workmen at their residential addresses. The court concluded that the workmen were entitled to the reliefs claimed.

The court order discusses a case involving workmen and management. The court found that the workmen Upender S/o Balram Prasad had no standing in the case, and that other workmen had not provided evidence to prove they were employees of the management. The court also found that some workmen had settled their disputes with the management, and that the management had not provided evidence to support their claim that they had changed their name and constitution. The court also discussed the circumstances under which the workmen had gone on strike and found that the notices issued by the management were not properly served. The court ultimately found that there was no termination on record, and that the workmen could not be reinstated into service as the management had closed down its activities.

The court order states that even if a reference is made under Section 10(d) of the Act, it cannot interfere with a company's discretion to close down its business. The court cannot order a company to reopen a closed business. In this case, it is established that the factory is closed, and therefore, reinstatement is not possible. The court must determine the compensation payable to each of the workmen. The order lists the names, status, service counted, and compensation arrived at for each of the workmen.

The court order pertains to a case involving several workers and their compensation claims. The court dismissed the claim of one worker and the claims of several others due to lack of evidence. Compensation was awarded to the remaining workers in lieu of reinstatement, with the management directed to pay the amounts within 30 days or face interest charges. The court also cited previous legal cases in determining that back wages could not be awarded in this case.

The court has ordered the management to pay the listed workmen within 30 days of the publication of the award. If they fail to do so, they will also be liable to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum from the date of the award until the payment is made. The reference is answered accordingly, and copies of the award will be sent to the appropriate government for publication. The file will be consigned to the record room. The order was issued on September 1, 2009, by the Labour Court in Delhi.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case between M/s Rodex Rubber Factory and Krantikari General Mazdoor Union. The court found that the termination of the workmen was illegal and ordered their reinstatement with full back wages and cost of litigation. The court also ordered the management to pay compensation to the remaining workers in lieu of reinstatement. The court found that the factory was closed and therefore, reinstatement was not possible. The court ordered the management to pay the listed workmen within 30 days of the publication of the award and copies of the award will be sent to the appropriate government for publication.
