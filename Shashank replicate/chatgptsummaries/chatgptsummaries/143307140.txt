The Supreme Court of India has recently issued two court orders that have significant implications for environmental protection and land use in the country. The first order pertains to an appeal filed by Subir Mario Chowfin against the National Green Tribunal's dismissal of his Original Application No. 637 of 2016. The NGT had dismissed Chowfin's application on technical grounds, stating that there was no disclosure of the date on which the cause of action arose, and that plural remedies had been adopted in respect of different causes of action in breach of Rule 14 of the NGT (Practice and Procedure) Rules, 2011. Chowfin had sought various reliefs, including declaring certain activities as illegal and violative of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and directing the authorities to take steps to stop them.

The Supreme Court found substance in Chowfin's submission that the NGT had adopted a misconceived line of reasoning and that the reasons which weighed with the NGT were erroneous. The Court admitted Chowfin's appeal and directed the NGT to hear the matter afresh. The Court also observed that the NGT should not have dismissed Chowfin's application on technical grounds, as the matter involved important issues of environmental protection and the interpretation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Court emphasized that the NGT should have taken a liberal and purposive approach in dealing with the matter, and that technicalities should not have been allowed to come in the way of justice.

The second court order pertains to a case filed by an appellant against the orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand dismissing writ petitions against the proceedings under the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960. The Supreme Court granted leave and ordered status quo, restoring the case to the file of the NGT for fresh disposal. The appeal was allowed and pending applications were disposed of.

These court orders have important implications for environmental protection and land use in India. The Supreme Court's decision to admit Chowfin's appeal and direct the NGT to hear the matter afresh is significant, as it underscores the importance of taking a liberal and purposive approach in dealing with matters of environmental protection. The Court's observation that technicalities should not be allowed to come in the way of justice is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need for a more holistic and inclusive approach to environmental governance in India.

Similarly, the Court's decision to grant leave and order status quo in the case pertaining to the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960, is significant, as it suggests that the Court is taking a more proactive role in ensuring that environmental and land use issues are dealt with in a fair and just manner. The Court's decision to restore the case to the file of the NGT for fresh disposal is also noteworthy, as it suggests that the Court is committed to ensuring that environmental and land use issues are dealt with in a timely and effective manner.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of environmental protection and land use issues in India, and the need for a more holistic and inclusive approach to environmental governance. They also underscore the role of the judiciary in ensuring that environmental and land use issues are dealt with in a fair and just manner, and the need for a more proactive and engaged judiciary in this regard.
