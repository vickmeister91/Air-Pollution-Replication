The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sanjeev Aga, the Managing Director of M/s Idea Communications Limited. Aga had challenged the action taken against him for erecting a telecom tower on a property granted on lease by the Haryana Tourism Corporation. The State of Haryana had issued notices alleging that the tower was illegally installed for non-forest purposes. Aga argued that the property did not fall under any subsisting notification of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 (PLPA) and that the State's action was not justified.

The Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 (PLPA) was enacted to preserve the forests and the environment in the state of Punjab. The Act prohibits the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior permission of the government. The Act also empowers the government to issue notifications declaring certain areas as "protected forests" or "reserved forests" and to regulate the use of such forests.

In this case, the State of Haryana had alleged that the property on which the telecom tower was erected fell under the purview of the PLPA and that the tower was illegally installed for non-forest purposes. However, Aga argued that the property did not fall under any subsisting notification of the PLPA and that the State's action was not justified.

The court, after hearing both sides, held that the State's action was not applicable under the PLPA and quashed the complaints, summoning orders, and notices. The court observed that the property in question did not fall under any subsisting notification of the PLPA and that the State's action was not justified. The court also noted that the State had failed to produce any evidence to show that the property was a forest land or that the tower was illegally installed for non-forest purposes.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope and applicability of the PLPA. The court has held that the PLPA applies only to forest land and that the government cannot use the Act to regulate the use of non-forest land. The court has also emphasized the importance of producing evidence to support any allegations of illegal use of forest land.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a writ petition filed by Sanjeev Aga, challenging the action taken against him for erecting a telecom tower on a property granted on lease by the Haryana Tourism Corporation. The court has held that the State's action was not applicable under the PLPA and quashed the complaints, summoning orders, and notices. The court's decision clarifies the scope and applicability of the PLPA and emphasizes the importance of producing evidence to support any allegations of illegal use of forest land.
