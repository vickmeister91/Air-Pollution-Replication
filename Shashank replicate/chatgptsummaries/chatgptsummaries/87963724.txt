The Telangana High Court issued a common order on January 21, 2019, regarding three cases: Criminal Petition Nos. 3988 of 2016 and 11942 of 2018, and Writ Petition No. 2253 of 2018. The petitions involve Mr. Bibhu Prasad Acharya and Adityanath Das, IAS, and their alleged involvement in offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The court order discusses the details of the cases and the parties involved, as well as references to relevant legal cases.

The court order discusses three different cases involving various individuals and companies accused of committing offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The petitions filed by the accused seek to quash the proceedings against them. The order provides details of the allegations against each accused and their involvement in the offenses. The court order includes statements made by B.P. Acharya, a managing director of APIIC Limited, regarding his role in the allotment of land to various companies, including Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Hetero Drugs Limited, for the development of a Special Economic Zone.

The court order pertains to the role of B.P. Acharya, the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of M/s APIIC Limited, in the allotment of land to Aurobindo Group Companies and Hetero Group companies. The court found that Acharya had shown undue favors to these companies by reducing the land price from Rs. 20.23 lakh per acre to Rs. 7 lakh per acre and transferring land to M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited, which was not a subsidiary of M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited at the relevant point in time. The court also found that bribe money was paid to Jagathi Publications Limited and Janani Infrastructure Private Limited of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in the guise of investments.

The court order states that Shri B.P Acharya is guilty of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 for assisting companies in creating proceeds of crime worth Rs. 21.50 Crore and causing loss to APIIC Limited. The court also mentions that there is no sanction obtained from the government to prosecute him and that the protection U/Sec. 197 Cr.P.C is applicable as he is a public servant. However, the counter filed by the investigating officer states that all provisions of Cr.P.C. are not applicable to the proceedings initiated by Enforcement Directorate under PML Act and that too the provisions of PML Act have overriding effect over other laws including Cr.P.C. under Section 71 of the Act.

The court order states that the prosecution under the PML Act is independent and does not require sanction to prosecute. The case in question involves a private complaint against 17 accused individuals and companies for alleged offenses under the PML Act. The role of BP Acharya, the former Vice Chairman and Managing Director of APIIC, is mentioned in the complaint as having shown undue favors to Indu Group companies in the allotment of land for an SEZ project, causing wrongful loss to APIIC and the government. The court order denies the quash petition and vacates the interim stay of the Sessions Case proceedings.

The court order accuses Shri B.P Acharya of violating norms and facilitating the creation of proceeds of crime by the Indu Group of companies. He is charged with the offense of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002. The order also discusses the absence of a sanction order to prosecute the petitioner and argues that the PML Act is a complete code providing the procedure for prosecution. The order cites various judgments to support its arguments.

The court order discusses the refusal of the State to sanction the accused public servants under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which conflicts with Section 48 of the 1974 Act. The order cites various cases to explain the need for a reasonable connection between the offending act and the discharge of official duty for prior sanction to be necessary. The writ petitioner, Adityanath Das, seeks to quash the proceedings against him in SC No. 2 of 2017 under the PML Act, but the Directorate of Enforcement seeks dismissal of the petition. The petitioner is accused of involvement in the allocation of water from Krishna and Kagna rivers to M/s. India Cements during his tenure as Secretary I & CAD.

The court order states that Adityanath Das, the former Secretary of Irrigation and Command Area Development in Andhra Pradesh, abused his official position and showed undue favors to M/s. India Cements by allotting an additional 10 Lakh Litres of water from River Kagna without referring the matter to Interstate Water Resources Authority, violating existing norms and causing wrongful loss to the government. He is guilty of the offense of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 punishable under Section 4 of PMLA, 2002. The court also discusses the definition of proceeds of crime, scheduled offenses, and the burden of proof on the accused. The order also mentions that companies can be prosecuted for contraventions of the provisions of the Act.

The court order discusses a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, where the accused are alleged to have committed the offense of money laundering. The accused have filed a quash petition challenging the cognizance order,
