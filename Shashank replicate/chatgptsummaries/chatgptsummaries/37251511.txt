The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves mining activity in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan, and the diversion of forest land for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The government issued a notification in 2015 requiring the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land in two equal installments within two years, which the petitioner and other mining lease holders deposited under protest. The court heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.

The court order lists several civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan. The names of the petitioners and respondents are mentioned along with their respective petition numbers. The lawyers representing the petitioners and respondents are also mentioned. However, no specific details about the content of the petitions are provided.

One of the writ petitions pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the required amount, but the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled, leaving the land unutilized. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court considers various documents and communications related to the cluster of mining leases and forest land, and both parties present their arguments.

Another writ petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire 281 hectares.

The court order pertains to a cluster area of 281 hectares in Udaipur, where 136 mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal to divert forest land for mining purposes. The court finds that the mining lease holders are not entitled to relief as they refused to segregate cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court partially allows the writ petitions and directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excludes the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directs the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases.

In conclusion, the court order deals with multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves mining activity in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan, and the diversion of forest land for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The court partially allows the writ petitions and directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area.
