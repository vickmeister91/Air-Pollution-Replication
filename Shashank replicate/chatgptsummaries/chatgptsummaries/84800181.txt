The court order pertains to several writ petitions filed by various companies against the Assistant Director and Recovery Officer of the Employees State Insurance Corporation. The petitioners seek to quash orders passed by the Employees State Insurance Court in Coimbatore and restore their cases for further consideration. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

In one of the cases, a company filed a writ petition under Section 75 of the ESI Act, seeking to condone the delay in filing a petition. The ESI Court rejected the petition on the grounds that the petitioner must exhaust the appeal remedy under Section 45AA of the ESI Act before filing a petition under Section 75. The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, challenging the ESI Court's decision. The learned Senior Counsel argued that the word "may" in Section 45AA of the Act is discretionary and does not compel the person to exhaust the appeal remedy. The court order discusses the interpretation of various provisions of the ESI Act and the intent of the legislation.

The court order refers to a previous judgment in a case involving M/s.Giriguja Publications Private Limited and the Regional Director of the Employees State Insurance Corporation. The court held that the writ petitioner has the option to approach the Appellate Authority under Section 45AA or Section 75 of the Act. The ESI Court made an error in applying the India Pistons case to reject the appeal filed by the petitioner under Section 75 of the Act. The court explains that Section 75 is a special provision for matters to be decided by the Employees State Insurance Court itself, while Section 45AA is an appeal remedy available to the management. The court also distinguishes the case of the Government of Tamil Nadu vs. National Green Tribunal, South Zone and others, which has no relevance to the specific provisions of the ESI Act.

In another case, the court order pertains to the interpretation of Section 45AA of the ESI Act. The court rules that the general rule is to exhaust all remedies before filing a writ petition, but in this case, since the word used in Section 45AA is "may" instead of "shall," the decision of the Division Bench cannot have any relief. The court cites previous cases to support its interpretation of the statutes and notes that the ESI Corporation itself issued a clarification note stating that there is no provision making it mandatory for an employer to exhaust the appeal provision under Section 45AA prior to filing an application under Section 75/78 of the ESI Act. The court also mentions an order passed by the ESI Court in an Interlocutory application, which concluded that the writ petitioner/employer has to exhaust the appeal remedy contemplated under Section 45AA of the ESI Act.

The court order states that the petitioner cannot file a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India if the issue is regarding the validity or interpretation of a particular provision of the Act. However, the court clarifies that there is no bar for entertaining the writ petition for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of the Act. The court also clarifies that the right provided under Section 45AA of the Act is optional, and all petitions filed under Section 75 of the Act are to be entertained and adjudicated on merits and in accordance with the law. The impugned order passed by the ESI Court is quashed, and the ESI Court is directed to entertain the interlocutory application as well as the appeal and decide the matters on merits and in accordance with the law. The order is to be communicated to all ESI Courts in Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry.

On October 24th, 2019, a court order was issued to four parties, including the Assistant Director and Recovery Officer of the Employees State Insurance Corporation, regarding three WP cases and three WMP cases. The details of the order, including whether an index or internet access was included, and whether it was a speaking or non-speaking order, are not specified.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment. The court order discusses the interpretation of various provisions of the ESI Act and the intent of the legislation.
