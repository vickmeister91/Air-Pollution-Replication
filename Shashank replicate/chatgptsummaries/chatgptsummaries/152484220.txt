The court order pertains to a land dispute between Racek Industries Pvt Ltd and the State of Maharashtra. The company claims ownership of the land based on a registered sale deed from 1955, but the state argues that the land is a private forest under the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975. The dispute centers around whether a notice issued under the Indian Forest Act in 1956 was served to the owner of the land. The court ultimately rules that the notice must have been served for the land to be considered a private forest, and as there is no evidence of service, the land cannot be classified as such.

The case of Racek Industries Pvt Ltd versus the State of Maharashtra revolves around a land dispute.

The Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975, was enacted to provide for the acquisition of private forests by the state government for the purpose of conservation and development of forests. The act defines a private forest as any land which is not a reserved forest or a protected forest and which is owned by a person other than the government. The act also provides for the payment of compensation to the owner of the land for the acquisition of the private forest.

In the case of Racek Industries Pvt Ltd versus the State of Maharashtra, the state argued that the land in question was a private forest under the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975, and therefore, the company did not have the right to claim ownership of the land. The company, on the other hand, argued that the land was not a private forest as it was not covered by the act.

However, since the land has not been classified as a private forest, the company has the right to claim ownership of the land.
