The court allowed the application and directed that the applicant be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during the trial.

Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the High Court or a Court of Session to grant bail in non-bailable offences. The section provides that a person accused of a non-bailable offence may be released on bail if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of such an offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
