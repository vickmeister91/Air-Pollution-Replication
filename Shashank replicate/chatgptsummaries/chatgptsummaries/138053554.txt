The National Green Tribunal received an application challenging the validity of the environment approval for the Pench diversion project in Madhya Pradesh. The applicants claimed that the project was started without prior environmental clearance and that it had caused damage to the environment and affected the lives of people in the area. The case involved several respondents, including the Ministry of Environment and Forest, the Central Water Commission, and the State of Madhya Pradesh. The applicants argued that the environmental approval granted in 1986 was no longer valid and that the project required fresh clearance under the EIA notification 2006. The case was heard by Hon'ble Mr. Justice M.Chockalingam and Hon'ble Dr. Ajay A. Deshpande.

The court order states that the proposed Pench Diversion Project, situated near the Pench National Park in Madhya Pradesh, is illegal as it did not receive environmental clearance under the EIA Notification 2006. The construction and related activities started by the project proponent from 04.11.2012 were also illegal. The court rejected the respondent's argument that the main application was barred by limitation, as the cause of action was continuing. The court also stated that the NGT Act's special provision of limitation would have overriding effect over the Limitation Act, and the theory of continuing cause of action cannot be accepted. The court concluded that the delay in filing the application was enormous, and the application is liable to be rejected.

The court order discusses an application made by the applicants challenging the environmental clearance granted for a construction project. The court rejects the application, stating that the delay in challenging the clearance was enormous and the application is barred by limitation. However, the applicants argue that the construction was started without valid prior environmental clearance and was continuously violating environmental protection laws. The court also notes that the respondents concealed relevant documents and made false statements on oath, which amounts to playing fraud on the Tribunal. The court discusses the concept of continuing cause of action and cites several judgments in support of the argument.

The court order discusses a case regarding the Pench Diversion Project and whether the applicants seeking relief were within the prescribed period of limitation as per the NGT Act, 2010. The court examines the concept of "continuing cause of action" and whether it applies in this case. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the Tribunal under Section 14 of the NGT Act, 2010. Ultimately, the court finds that the applicants were within the prescribed period of limitation and grants the relief sought.

The court order discusses the period of limitation for filing an application for relief and compensation for victims of pollution and environmental damage under the NGT Act, 2010. The cause of action for such disputes must arise from one of the seven enactments specified under Schedule-I, and the application must be made within six months from the date of the cause of action. The court also defines the term "cause of action" and rejects the argument that the construction activities for the project commenced on 04.11.2012. The court concludes that the specific period of limitation provided under the NGT Act, 2010 excludes the general provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963.

The court order discusses an application made by residents of an area where a dam project was undertaken. The applicants sought a declaration that the project should not commence without prior environmental clearance under the EIA Notification 2006 and compensation for those affected by the illegal construction. The court rejected the application as it was not within the period of limitation prescribed under the NGT Act. However, the court noted that the applicants could still bring to the notice of the legal forum the activities that are violative of environmental laws and seek enforcement of their rights relating to the environment. The court also discussed the wide jurisdiction of the Tribunal in matters relating to the environment.

The court order discusses the definition of "substantial question relating to environment" and emphasizes the importance of interpreting it broadly to achieve the objectives of preventing and protecting against environmental pollution. The court dismisses the current application as not maintainable due to being barred by limitation, but grants the applicants liberty to file a fresh application for necessary reliefs within the framework of the NGT Act. The order was issued by the Central Zonal Bench in Bhopal on August 12, 2013.

In summary, the court orders discussed various applications challenging the validity of environmental clearances for construction projects and seeking relief for environmental damage caused by such projects. The court examined the concept of continuing cause of action and the period of limitation for filing such applications under the NGT Act, 2010. The court also emphasized the importance of interpreting the definition of "substantial question relating to environment" broadly to achieve the objectives of preventing and protecting against environmental pollution. While some applications were rejected due to being barred by limitation, the court granted relief in cases where the applicants were within the prescribed period of limitation. The court also noted the wide jurisdiction of the Tribunal in matters relating to the environment and encouraged applicants to bring to the notice of the legal forum any activities that are violative of environmental laws and seek enforcement of their rights relating to the environment.
