The Gujarat High Court has issued an order to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to submit an affidavit disclosing whether the directions issued by them under the Air and Water Acts in the matter of ceramic industries at Morbi and Wankaner have been modified. The Board has also been asked to clarify whether the mandatory directions given earlier have been revoked, authorizing the units to continue in violation of the directions. The case has been adjourned for further hearing on December 19, 2013.

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) seeking directions to the CPCB to take action against ceramic industries in Morbi and Wankaner for violating pollution norms. The GPCB had alleged that the ceramic industries were discharging untreated effluent into the nearby water bodies, causing severe pollution and health hazards to the people living in the area.

The GPCB had also alleged that the CPCB had failed to take any action against the ceramic industries despite repeated complaints and requests. The GPCB had further alleged that the CPCB had issued directions to the ceramic industries to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and to comply with the pollution norms, but the industries had failed to comply with the directions.

The CPCB, in its response, had denied the allegations and had stated that it had issued directions to the ceramic industries to install ETPs and to comply with the pollution norms. The CPCB had further stated that it had conducted inspections of the ceramic industries and had found that some of the industries were not complying with the directions. The CPCB had also stated that it had issued show-cause notices to the non-compliant industries and had initiated legal action against them.

The Gujarat High Court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, had directed the CPCB to submit an affidavit disclosing whether the directions issued by them under the Air and Water Acts in the matter of ceramic industries at Morbi and Wankaner have been modified. The Court had also asked the CPCB to clarify whether the mandatory directions given earlier have been revoked, authorizing the units to continue in violation of the directions.

The Court had observed that the issue of pollution caused by the ceramic industries was a serious matter and needed to be addressed urgently. The Court had further observed that the CPCB had a duty to ensure that the pollution norms were complied with and that the industries did not cause any harm to the environment and the people living in the area.

The Court had also directed the GPCB to submit a report on the steps taken by them to control pollution caused by the ceramic industries. The Court had observed that the GPCB had a duty to ensure that the pollution norms were complied with and that the industries did not cause any harm to the environment and the people living in the area.

The Court had adjourned the case for further hearing on December 19, 2013, and had directed the CPCB and the GPCB to submit their affidavits before the next hearing. The Court had also directed the parties to maintain the status quo till the next hearing.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court has issued an order to the CPCB to submit an affidavit disclosing whether the directions issued by them under the Air and Water Acts in the matter of ceramic industries at Morbi and Wankaner have been modified. The Court has also asked the CPCB to clarify whether the mandatory directions given earlier have been revoked, authorizing the units to continue in violation of the directions.
