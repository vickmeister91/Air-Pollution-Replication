The court order pertains to a contempt petition filed by G. Rajaram against T.K. Rajendran and Polonath for disobeying a court order dated 14.7.2009 made in Review Application No.48 of 2009. The petitioner had been appointed as Grade II Police Constable and was subsequently promoted as Grade I Police Constable. The Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board invited applications for recruitment to the post of Sub Inspector of Police for the year 1997-98. The selection process was questioned by various candidates before the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal on the ground that the zonal wise selection was invalid. The Tribunal allowed those original applications holding that the zonal wise selection procedure was impermissible under the special rules for Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service Rules. The Division Bench held that the zonal wise selections were invalid but did not interfere with the selections already made, as they were made in the year 1999.

The petitioner was not called for oral interview, and he filed O.A.No.51 of 2003 questioning the selection to the post of Sub Inspector of Police for the year 1997-98 under 20% quota for departmental candidates as well as 80% quota by way of direct recruitment. The said writ petition was allowed on 10.11.2005 following the earlier Division Bench order dated 25.2.2005 made in W.P.No.17639 to 17660 of 2000 etc., batch. The State represented by the Secretary to Home Department, the Director General of Police and the Chairman, Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board preferred Review Application No.73 of 2006 seeking for review of the order dated 10.11.2005. The review application was filed mainly on the ground that the petitioner had only competed under 20% quota and as per the conditions for selection, he should complete 100 metres running within 15 seconds. The Division Bench found that the directions contained in paragraph 73(vi) of the order dated 25.2.2005 would not be applicable to the petitioner, as he had not only taken the written test but also failed in the physical efficiency test and therefore he was not eligible to be called for oral interview. The petitioner filed another Review Application No.48 of 2009 seeking for review of the judgment dated 31.7.2008 in Review Application No.73 of 2006 and to restore the earlier.

The court found that there was no willful disobedience of court orders and rejected the petitioner's claim. However, the court acknowledged that the petitioner had suffered due to the incorrect statements made by the respondents during the selection process and subsequent legal battles. The court considered awarding compensation to the petitioner for the prejudice and hardship caused to him. The court also discussed the purpose of contempt proceedings and the power of the court to impose punishment and award compensation.

In another case, the court discussed a situation where a person was not allowed to participate in an interview for a job due to false claims made by the respondents. The court emphasized that officers defending the government in court must present only true facts and any deviation from the records would amount to filing a false statement before the court. The court ordered the state to compensate the petitioner with a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- for the ordeal he had to undergo physically, mentally, and financially. The court also observed that justice must win and any attempt to tamper with the judicial process would destroy the judicial system itself.
