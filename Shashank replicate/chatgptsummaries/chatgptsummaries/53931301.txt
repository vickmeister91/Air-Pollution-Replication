The Bombay High Court has issued several court orders in various cases involving the establishment of a sugar factory and its impact on the environment. The cases involve disputes between different sugar factories and various government entities in the state of Maharashtra. The court orders list the parties involved in each case and specify their respective roles.

In one case, Grampanchayat Aashti vs various government entities and Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., the court order clarifies that private sugar factories can apply for an aerial distance certificate as long as they do not receive financial assistance. One factory, Audumbarraoji, obtained the certificate and began construction, but faced legal challenges from another factory, Lokshakti, and local residents. The court ordered the Collector to examine Audumbarraoji's permissions and, if they were found to be in order, allowed the factory to continue construction. However, objections were raised regarding the location of the factory and the court ultimately ordered Audumbarraoji to obtain all necessary permissions before continuing construction.

In another case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the setting up of a new sugar factory within a 15 km radius of existing sugar factories. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the proposed factory was more than 15 km away from existing factories, but some individuals filed writ petitions challenging this certification. The court considered the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which specify the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory, including obtaining a certificate from the concerned State Government that the proposed site is not within the minimum distance prescribed by the Central Government or the State Government. The court did not provide a final decision on the matter.

The court order also specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court will consider the objections of Lokshakti, who challenged the grant of aerial distance certificate to Audumbarraoji. The court will also consider the decision of the Division Bench of the court at Aurangabad in Gangamai Industries & Construction Limited vs. State of Maharashtra and Others.

In another case, the court order discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court refers to a previous case, Gangamai, which established that the Survey of India has the power to determine the minimum distance between sugar factories, and the Commissioner of Sugar cannot make a decision contrary to this. The court examines the timing of the applications made by Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji and ultimately concludes that Audumbarraoji's application was valid and Lokshakti's was rejected due to the order passed in PIL No. 20 of 2006. The court also notes that Gopal Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited and Audumbarraoji are the same entity, and therefore, the change of name was legal.

In yet another case, the court order pertains to the construction of a sugar factory on agricultural land in Maharashtra. The petitioner alleges that the factory was built without proper permissions and that the location was changed without authorization. The court had previously ordered the collector to examine the permissions obtained by the factory owner, and it was found that several necessary permissions had been obtained. However, the petitioner obtained a new order restraining the factory owner from continuing construction due to a missing aerial distance certificate for the changed location.

In conclusion, the court orders issued by the Bombay High Court in these cases involve disputes between different sugar factories and various government entities in the state of Maharashtra. The court has clarified the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory and has ordered the parties involved to obtain all necessary permissions before continuing construction. The court has also considered objections to the grant of licenses and the construction of sugar factories and has provided a chronology of events related to these disputes. The court has also specified the time frame for taking effective steps and commencing commercial production and has warned that failure to do so will result in the performance guarantee being forfeited.
