The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Varghese, also known as Thampan, against the judgment in CC 700/1997 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Peerumedu, dated 22.6.2001. Varghese was charged under section 9, 27(1), 29, and 31 of the Wild Life Protection Act for hunting a nilgiri languor without a permit in the Periyar Wild Life Sanctuary.

The prosecution presented evidence that Varghese and another person trespassed into the sanctuary and hunted the animal with a country gun. Varghese was found guilty and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months under section 9 of the Act, six months under section 27(1) of the Act, one year and a fine of Rs.2000/- each in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for four months under section 27(1) of the Act, and six months under section 31 of the Act.
