Saravanan to prevent the transfer of his private complaint filed in C.C.No.5450 of 2010 from the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai to the Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai. The court ordered that the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai should proceed with the case to its logical conclusion, as the creation of the Fast Track Court for dealing with Negotiable Instruments Act cases has not extinguished the ordinary original jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Magistrate No.XVIII, Saidapet.

The petitioner, A. Saravanan, had filed a private complaint in C.C.No.5450 of 2010 before the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai.

The court observed that the transfer of the case from the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai to the Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai would result in unnecessary delay and inconvenience to the petitioner.

The court held that the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai should proceed with the case to its logical conclusion, and that the transfer of the case to the Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai was not warranted.
