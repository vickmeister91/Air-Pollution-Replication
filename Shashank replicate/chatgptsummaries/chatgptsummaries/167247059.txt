The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Sukhdev Singh, who challenged the rejection of his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. by the trial court. The application was for summoning the income tax returns and cash book ledger of the complainant. The trial court had rejected the application, and the decision was affirmed by the revision court. The High Court dismissed the petition, stating that two courts had already recorded concurrent findings of facts against the petitioner, and there was no reason to interfere. However, the petitioner was given liberty to renew the prayer for summoning the documents at the appropriate stage of the trial.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Sukhdev Singh and the complainant, whose income tax returns and cash book ledger Singh sought to summon. The trial court had rejected Singh's application, and this decision was upheld by the revision court. Singh then filed a petition with the High Court, seeking to challenge the lower courts' decisions.

The High Court, however, dismissed Singh's petition, stating that the lower courts had already recorded concurrent findings of facts against him. The court noted that it was not its role to interfere with the lower courts' decisions unless there was a clear error of law or fact. In this case, the court found no such error and therefore declined to interfere.

Despite dismissing Singh's petition, the High Court did grant him some relief. The court gave him the liberty to renew his prayer for summoning the documents at the appropriate stage of the trial. This means that Singh can still seek to obtain the income tax returns and cash book ledger of the complainant, but he will have to do so at a later stage of the trial.

Overall, the court order in this case affirms the principle that courts should not interfere with lower courts' decisions unless there is a clear error of law or fact. The High Court found no such error in this case and therefore declined to interfere with the lower courts' decisions. However, the court did grant Singh some relief by allowing him to renew his prayer for summoning the documents at a later stage of the trial.
