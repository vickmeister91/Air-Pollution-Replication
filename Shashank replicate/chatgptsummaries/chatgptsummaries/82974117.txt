The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by S.R. Venkatesh, who sought to set aside an order passed under Section 91(1) r/w Sec. 343(2) of CRPC in CC No.232/11. Venkatesh is being prosecuted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The petitioner had sought to summon all the previous cheques drawn by him on his bank account from the bank concerned to prove that the cheque in question was issued as a security while it was in the blank state. However, the court rejected the petition, stating that summoning all the cheques from the bank for comparison is not necessary for the just decision in the case.

The case revolves around a cheque issued by Venkatesh, which was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds. The complainant in the case alleged that Venkatesh had issued the cheque as a repayment for a loan, and that he had no intention of honouring it. Venkatesh, on the other hand, claimed that the cheque was issued as a security and that it was in the blank state when it was given to the complainant.

In order to prove his claim, Venkatesh had sought to summon all the previous cheques drawn by him on his bank account from the bank concerned. He argued that this would establish that he had a practice of issuing blank cheques as security, and that the cheque in question was no exception. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that summoning all the cheques from the bank for comparison is not necessary for the just decision in the case.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the issue in the case was not whether Venkatesh had a practice of issuing blank cheques as security, but whether the cheque in question was issued as a repayment for a loan. The court noted that the complainant had already produced evidence to show that the cheque was issued as a repayment for a loan, and that Venkatesh had not produced any evidence to the contrary. The court also noted that Venkatesh had not explained why he had issued a blank cheque as security, and that this raised doubts about his claim.

In light of these facts, the court concluded that summoning all the cheques from the bank for comparison was not necessary for the just decision in the case. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference with the order passed under Section 91(1) r/w Sec. 343(2) of CRPC in CC No.232/11. Accordingly, the court rejected the petition filed by Venkatesh.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by S.R. Venkatesh seeking to set aside an order passed under Section 91(1) r/w Sec. 343(2) of CRPC in CC No.232/11. Venkatesh had sought to summon all the previous cheques drawn by him on his bank account from the bank concerned to prove that the cheque in question was issued as a security while it was in the blank state. However, the court rejected the petition, stating that summoning all the cheques from the bank for comparison is not necessary for the just decision in the case. The court's decision was based on the fact that the issue in the case was not whether Venkatesh had a practice of issuing blank cheques as security, but whether the cheque in question was issued as a repayment for a loan. The court concluded that summoning all the cheques from the bank for comparison was not necessary for the just decision in the case, and rejected the petition filed by Venkatesh.
