The court orders discussed in this text relate to various petitions filed against the Government of Tamil Nadu and other respondents regarding the ban on plastic items. The first court order pertains to two petitions filed by Savani Screen and Naga Screen against the government regarding the inclusion of non-woven polypropylene bags as a banned plastic item. The petitioners argue that these bags are reusable and recyclable and should not be banned. They seek a writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash the ban and declare that the restriction imposed by the government is not for the manufacture and sale of polypropylene multiple user bags containing above 50 microns. The court heard arguments from both sides and will issue a ruling.

The second court order pertains to a challenge against a government order issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board restricting the manufacture and sale of polypropylene bags above 50 microns. The petitioners argue that the order is contrary to the Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 and that the state government does not have the jurisdiction to issue such an order. However, the court rejects these arguments, citing previous decisions that have upheld the government order. The court therefore dismisses the petitioners' challenge.

The third court order states that the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners cannot be accepted due to binding precedent. The issue of whether the State Government was legally correct in issuing a ban on one-time use plastic was considered, and the contention of the manufacturers was rejected. The court refers to a previous judgment that dismissed a writ petition on the same issue and held that the government is justified in invoking Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act. The court quotes relevant portions of the previous judgment to support its decision.

The fourth court order discusses the power of the Central Government and its delegatee under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which allows for the prohibition of any industry, closure, or regulation. The order cites previous cases where the government has issued orders prohibiting the location of industries in specified areas and banning the manufacture and use of plastic materials. The court dismisses a writ petition challenging a government order banning certain plastics but also directs the government to consider phasing out all plastic in the market before the end of 2019. The court also directs the Madurai Corporation to seize all plastic articles and take action against those manufacturing, selling, or using non-woven bags.

The fifth court order upholds the validity of a government order issued by the State of Tamil Nadu in 2018 banning the manufacture, storage, supply, sale, and use of "use and throwaway plastics" such as plastic sheets, plates, cups, straws, and bags. The petitioner argued that the order had no legislative sanction, but the court rejected this argument, stating that Section 5 of the Environment Act gives the Central Government the power to regulate or prohibit industries or operations for environmental protection. The court also noted that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a central law that occupies the field, so there is no need for the state government to enact a separate law.

The sixth court order prohibits the selling or using of non-woven bags until appropriate regulations are made. The Corporation must impose a fine of Rs. 500 on those who are found using banned plastics for the first time, and in case of repeated violation, the license may be suspended. The expenses for disposing of seized plastic items should also be collected from the violators. The court dismissed the writ petitions and upheld the government order in the interest of protecting and improving the environment.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this text pertain to various petitions challenging the ban on plastic items in Tamil Nadu. While some petitions were dismissed, others were upheld, and the court directed the government to consider phasing out all plastic in the market before the end of 2019. The court also directed the Madurai Corporation to seize all plastic articles and take action against those manufacturing, selling, or using non-woven bags. The court orders aim to protect and improve the environment by regulating the use of plastic items.
