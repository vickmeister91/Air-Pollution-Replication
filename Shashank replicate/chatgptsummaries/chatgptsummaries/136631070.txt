The court order pertains to three separate writ petitions filed against the State of Karnataka, each concerning the grant or renewal of mining leases. The first petition was filed by M/S Sunvik Steels Pvt Ltd, seeking to set aside an order passed by the court in 2004, quash a communication issued by the State Government in 2007, and direct the State Government to consider their application for grant of mining lease. The court heard the case and reserved judgment. The order ultimately upholds the renewal of the mining lease in favor of the third respondent and dismisses the writ petition.

The second petition concerns the history of a mining lease granted to the third respondent's father in 1958, which expired in 1983. The third respondent's mother made two unsuccessful applications for renewal of the lease, and a third application made in 2003 was not made within the stipulated time and should have been rejected. However, a notification was issued in 2007 renewing the lease for 20 years, which the court found to be erroneous and set aside. The court also noted that pending applications for mining leases must be decided in accordance with the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The third petition pertains to Section 10A of a law that came into effect in 2015. Sub-Section (1) of Section 10A states that all pending applications become ineligible, while Sub-Section (2) provides an exception if the application satisfies certain conditions. The court order declares that an application for lease renewal made in 2003 was not maintainable in law and sets aside two notifications related to the renewal. The State Government is directed to consider the application in accordance with the law and make a decision within two months. The order is partly allowed with no costs.

In the first petition, M/S Sunvik Steels Pvt Ltd sought to challenge an order passed by the court in 2004, which had dismissed their application for grant of mining lease. The petitioner also sought to quash a communication issued by the State Government in 2007, which had rejected their application for renewal of the lease. The court heard the case and reserved judgment. In its order, the court discusses the history of mining leases granted to the third respondent's family and subsequent applications for renewal. The court also considers the validity of a notification issued by the State Government in 2002 for re-grant of mining leases.

The court ultimately upholds the renewal of the mining lease in favor of the third respondent and dismisses the writ petition. The court notes that the petitioner had failed to establish any illegality or irregularity in the grant of the lease to the third respondent. The court also observes that the petitioner had not challenged the grant of the lease to the third respondent's father in 1958, and that the lease had been renewed several times since then.

In the second petition, the court discusses the history of a mining lease granted to the third respondent's father in 1958, which had expired in 1983. The third respondent's mother had made two unsuccessful applications for renewal of the lease, and a third application made in 2003 was not made within the stipulated time and should have been rejected. However, a notification was issued in 2007 renewing the lease for 20 years, which the court found to be erroneous and set aside.

The court notes that pending applications for mining leases must be decided in accordance with the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The court observes that the renewal of the lease in 2007 was not in accordance with the Act, as the application for renewal had not been made within the stipulated time. The court also notes that the renewal of the lease had been made without following the due process of law.

In the third petition, the court considers the provisions of Section 10A of a law that came into effect in 2015. Sub-Section (1) of Section 10A states that all pending applications become ineligible, while Sub-Section (2) provides an exception if the application satisfies certain conditions. The court order declares that an application for lease renewal made in 2003 was not maintainable in law and sets aside two notifications related to the renewal.
