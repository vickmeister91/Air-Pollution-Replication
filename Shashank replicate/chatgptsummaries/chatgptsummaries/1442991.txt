The Gujarat High Court recently quashed a complaint against two directors of a private limited company who were accused of causing pollution. The court found that the directors were not responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company and were not in charge of its conduct. The court relied on Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which imposes vicarious liability on individuals who are in charge of and responsible for the conduct of a company's business. The court also cited previous cases to support its decision.

The case involved a complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against two directors of a private limited company for causing pollution. The complaint alleged that the company had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby river, which had caused damage to the environment and public health. The directors were accused of being responsible for the company's conduct and were therefore held liable for the pollution.

However, the directors argued that they were not responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company and were not in charge of its conduct. They claimed that the company had a managing director who was responsible for the company's operations and that they had no involvement in the discharge of effluent.

The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and found that the directors were not responsible for the company's conduct. The court relied on Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which imposes vicarious liability on individuals who are in charge of and responsible for the conduct of a company's business. The court noted that the directors were not in charge of the company's day-to-day affairs and were not responsible for its conduct.

The court also cited previous cases to support its decision. In one case, the Supreme Court had held that a director who was not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the company could not be held liable for the company's actions. In another case, the Delhi High Court had held that a director who was not involved in the management of the company could not be held liable for the company's pollution.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the extent of a director's liability for a company's actions. The court's reliance on Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is also noteworthy as it highlights the importance of holding individuals who are in charge of a company's business responsible for its conduct.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's decision to quash the complaint against the two directors of the private limited company is a welcome clarification of the extent of a director's liability for a company's actions. The court's reliance on Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is also significant as it emphasizes the importance of holding individuals who are in charge of a company's business responsible for its conduct.
