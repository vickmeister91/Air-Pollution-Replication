In the first court order, the Guwahati Sub-Divisional Market Committee filed a complaint against NU Foods for dealing with wheat products without paying the required cess and without a valid license. The accused/respondent filed an application under Section 294 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, along with 30 different documents, with a prayer for issuing direction to the complainant, petitioner committee to admit the said documents, before the evidence of the complainant was recorded. The petitioner objected, stating that the accused's right to produce any document would accrue to him only after the accused enters the defense and after recording of the evidence by the complainant/prosecution. The court referred to the decision of the Apex Court reported in (2005) 1 SCC 568 (State of Orissa Vs. Debendra Nath Padhi), which stated that the right of the accused in filing the documents during the course of the Trial would accrue only after the accused entered the defense and not prior to that. The court upheld the petitioner's objection.

The second court order deals with the admissibility of documents in cases under Section 138 of the Act, which deals with dishonored cheques. The court provides guidelines and directions for such cases, including the need for the original documents to be presented, the importance of material facts and particulars in the complaint, and the avoidance of unnecessary persons as accused. The order also discusses the admissibility of documents and the need for proof of signature in certain cases. The court emphasizes the importance of following these guidelines to ensure the proper administration of justice.

In the third court order, the accused in a case under Section 138 of the Act filed an application under Section 294 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for the admission of certain documents. The court held that the accused cannot file documents under Section 294 of CrPC in his defense at any stage of the proceeding, calling upon the prosecution to admit such documents before adducing the prosecution evidence and without taking his own defense stand. The accused may file an application under Section 294 of CrPC on the conclusion of the recording of the prosecution evidence and after recording of the statement of the accused in terms of the provision of Section 313 CrPC. The matter is remitted to the trial court with a direction to consider the application under Section 294 of CrPC filed by the respondent/opposite party only after recording his statement under Section 313 CrPC.

In summary, these court orders deal with the admissibility of documents in criminal cases. The first order upholds the petitioner's objection to the accused's attempt to introduce documents before entering the defense. The second order provides guidelines for cases under Section 138 of the Act, emphasizing the importance of presenting original documents and including material facts and particulars in the complaint. The third order clarifies the procedure for the admission of documents under Section 294 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in cases under Section 138 of the Act. These orders aim to ensure the proper administration of justice by consolidating the rules and procedures for the admissibility of documents in criminal cases.
