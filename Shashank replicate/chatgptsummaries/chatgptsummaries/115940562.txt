The court has granted bail to Surat Singh and Mohan Singh in a case registered by the Forest Department Barman, District Narsinghpur under Sections 2, 9, & 39 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that the petitioners had killed a male sambar by hunting dogs and cut its carcass with an axe. However, the court noted that apart from the statement of co-accused Roop Singh, there was nothing to connect the petitioners to the crime. Therefore, the court allowed the bail application and directed the petitioners to furnish a personal bond of Rs 40,000/- with one solvent surety in the same amount each to the satisfaction of the trial court.
