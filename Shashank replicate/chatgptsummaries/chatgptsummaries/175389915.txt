The Kerala High Court recently heard a case involving M/S.Muthoot Finance Ltd's application for a building permit to construct its corporate office on a 3.20-acre land in Elamkulam and Poonithura villages in Kanayannur Taluk. The court was presented with various exhibits, including necessary statutory clearances and certificates, before hearing arguments from both sides and making a judgment.

In another case, the court discussed a dispute over the use of a piece of land in Kochi, India. The petitioner argued that they should be allowed to use the land for mixed purposes, while the government contended that the land is designated for public use and cannot be used for other purposes without acquisition. The court considered previous cases and zoning regulations before ultimately ruling in favor of the government, stating that the land cannot be used for mixed purposes without acquisition.

The court order emphasized that any restriction on the enjoyment of land must be in accordance with the procedure authorized by law. Any attempt to curb the rights of landowners before the publication of statutory notifications and declarations would result in a violation of the right to property under Article 300A of the Constitution. The court also discussed the issue of distance norms and contiguity of plots, stating that once a property is contiguous, it becomes fully compliant with distance norms. The court cited the importance of planned development of urban spaces through zoning and regulation laws for the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.

In a separate case, the court noted that a plot had become compliant with distance norms, and a culvert had already been permitted by the Corporation. The court observed that the authorities had treated the property on either side of the canal as contiguous, and there was no reason for differential treatment. The court set aside certain exhibits and directed the respondents to reconsider the petitioner's application for a building permit and pass appropriate orders within a month's time. The writ petition was disposed of with no order as to costs.

In summary, the Kerala High Court heard several cases related to land use and building permits. The court emphasized the importance of following legal procedures and regulations while restricting the enjoyment of land. The court also highlighted the significance of planned development of urban spaces for the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. In one case, the court ruled in favor of the government, stating that a piece of land designated for public use cannot be used for mixed purposes without acquisition. In another case, the court directed the authorities to reconsider a petitioner's application for a building permit and pass appropriate orders within a month's time.
