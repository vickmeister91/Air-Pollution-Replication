The court order in question pertains to a criminal case between two individuals, Raju and Suresh. Raju had filed petitions under section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order confirming the order dated 53.11.2007 in C.C.NOS.605/O6, 609/06, 638/06 and 605/O6 respectively. The petitioner had made certain payments and was found due in a sum of Rs.13,27,855/-, and in order to repay, he issued four cheques, which were dishonored. The petitioner denied the allegations and filed applications under sections 91 and 243 Cr.P.C. and under section 45 of the Evidence Act. However, the court dismissed the applications, and the petitioner appealed to the revisional court, which concurred with the findings of the trial court and dismissed the revision petitions.

The petitioner then appealed to the High Court of Karnataka, which ordered that the revision petitions be rejected, the orders be set aside, and the petitioner be allowed to present evidence before pursuing the applications filed under sections 91 and 243 Cr.P.C. and under section 45 of the Evidence Act. The High Court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to present evidence in support of his case. The court noted that the trial court had not considered the evidence presented by the petitioner and had relied solely on the complainant's version of events.

The High Court also observed that the trial court had not followed the proper procedure while dismissing the applications filed by the petitioner. The court noted that the trial court had not given any reasons for dismissing the applications and had not considered the evidence presented by the petitioner. The High Court held that the trial court's order was therefore unsustainable and set it aside.
