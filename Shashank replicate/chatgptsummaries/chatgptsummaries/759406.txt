The petitioner had purchased land and filed a petition seeking to quash the order granting permission to the respondent to construct the plant. However, the court found that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to support their claim that the plant was causing pollution.

The court noted that the Pollution Control Board had renewed the consent issued to the respondent, indicating that the plant was operating within the permissible limits. The court also observed that the petitioner had not approached the Pollution Control Board to raise their concerns about the plant's operation.

The court further noted that the respondent had obtained all necessary permissions and clearances from the relevant authorities before commencing construction of the plant. The court found no merit in the petitioner's argument that the plant was causing pollution and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision highlights the importance of producing evidence to support claims made in court. In this case, the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the plant was causing pollution.
