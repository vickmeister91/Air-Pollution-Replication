The Karnataka High Court recently issued three court orders pertaining to writ petitions filed against the State of Karnataka and various departments and individuals related to the issuance of licenses for stone crushers in the Shimoga district. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri N Santhosh and others against the State of Karnataka and various departments and individuals related to the issuance of licenses for stone crushers in the Shimoga district. The petitioners sought to quash several licenses issued by the respondents and requested that objections filed by the petitioners and villagers be considered.

The petitioners claimed that the licenses were issued without considering the objections filed by them and the villagers. They also claimed that the licenses were issued in violation of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, which deals with the conditions for granting a license for stone crushing units. The court examined the Act and found that the licenses were issued in accordance with the parameters set in the Act. The court also noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claims and dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of Mathikoppa Malavalli of Masagalli village, Shimoga district, assailing the Final Notification issued by the Deputy Commissioner regarding the location of a safer zone for stone crushing units. The petitioners claimed that the notification was issued without hearing the villagers and that the safer zone is located in gomal land. The court ordered respondent No. 1 to 8 to consider the objections filed by the petitioners and villagers. The court also noted that this is the third time the location of the safer zone has been challenged and that the petitioners' motives may not be bona fide. The court examined Section 6 of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, which deals with the conditions for granting a license for stone crushing units, and found that the location of the safer zone is in accordance with the parameters set in the Act.

The third court order dismisses a writ petition regarding the location of a safer zone in Sy.No.16. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board approved the location, and the court will not interfere with their decision. The writ petition is dismissed, but no costs are imposed.

In summary, the court orders pertain to writ petitions filed against the State of Karnataka and various departments and individuals related to the issuance of licenses for stone crushers in the Shimoga district. The court examined the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, and found that the licenses and the location of the safer zone were issued in accordance with the parameters set in the Act. The court also ordered the respondents to consider the objections filed by the petitioners and villagers. The court dismissed one writ petition and did not impose any costs.
