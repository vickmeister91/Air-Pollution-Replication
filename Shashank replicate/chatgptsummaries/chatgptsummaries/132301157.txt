The court order pertains to various writ petitions challenging orders passed by committees constituted to consider the claims of the petitioners for exclusion of their land from the purview of forest land. The court order disposes of the present writ petition as well as three other connected writ petitions. The order also provides the background of the case, including a notification issued by the State Government in 1970 prohibiting certain acts in areas notified under Section 3 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, and whether it restricts the use of land for non-forest purposes only in certain areas or in all areas. The petitioner argues that the restrictions only apply to land falling under Section 5(a) of the Act, while the respondent argues that the restrictions apply to all areas notified under Section 5. The court cites previous orders and notifications to conclude that the restrictions on cutting trees and collecting grass apply to all areas notified under Section 5, and that such areas are to be treated as forests for the purposes of the Forest Conservation Act. Therefore, any use of such areas for non-forestry purposes must comply with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act.

The court order pertains to the pasturing of cattle in certain areas where the forest crop is well established. The Divisional Forest Officer has the authority to allow grazing in case of emergencies such as drought or floods. The notification under Sections 4 & 5 of the Act has been considered by the Supreme Court in various orders passed in T.N.Godavarman Thirumulkpad Vs. Union of India & others and in M.C.Mehta's case. The court has declared that the lands/areas forming part of the notification under section 3 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 and in respect of which restrictions have been imposed under Section 4 of the said Act are declared to be "forest lands" for the purposes of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Such areas shall not be used for 'non-forest purposes' including the mining of 'major' or 'minor' minerals.

The court order pertains to the provisions of the FC Act, which empowers the State Government to issue directions for the conservation of sub-soil water or the prevention of erosion. The Act allows the government to impose restrictions on various activities such as cultivation, quarrying, cutting of trees, etc. within the notified areas. The purpose of the Act is to conserve sub-soil water and prevent erosion. The court cites a previous case where the cutting of trees or timber was prohibited under Section 4 of the Act, and the land subject to the notification could not be used for non-forest purposes.

The court order states that a notification has been issued prohibiting the use of land for non-forest purposes. The court has held that this notification applies to the land in question and cannot be used for non-forest purposes without the approval of the Central Government. The court also cites a previous Supreme Court ruling that prohibits mining in areas that have been designated as forest land. The court finds no illegality in the order passed by the Committee and dismisses the writ petition.

In summary, the court order pertains to various writ petitions challenging orders passed by committees constituted to consider the claims of the petitioners for exclusion of their land from the purview of forest land. The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, and whether it restricts the use of land for non-forest purposes only in certain areas or in all areas. The court also discusses the provisions of the FC Act, which empowers the State Government to issue directions for the conservation of sub-soil water or the prevention of erosion. The court finds no illegality in the order passed by the Committee and dismisses the writ petition.
