The court order in question relates to a case where the plaintiff had filed a suit for the recovery of possession of immovable property under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act. The suit was decreed in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant subsequently applied for revision. The court, in its ruling, held that the defendant had no other remedy available to them to establish their title to the property and recover possession. The court also held that the civil court had no jurisdiction in this matter, as the plaintiff had been dispossessed in due course of law by a revenue court.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal provisions. The plaintiff had claimed that they were the rightful owner of the property in question and had been unlawfully dispossessed by the defendant. The defendant, on the other hand, had argued that they were the rightful owner of the property and had not unlawfully dispossessed the plaintiff.

The court, after examining the evidence presented by both parties, found that the plaintiff had indeed been dispossessed of the property in question. However, the court also found that the plaintiff had been dispossessed in due course of law by a revenue court. This meant that the civil court had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's suit for the recovery of possession of the property.

The court also noted that the defendant had no other remedy available to them to establish their title to the property and recover possession. This was because the revenue court had already decided the matter and had found in favor of the plaintiff. As such, the court held that the defendant's application for revision was without merit and dismissed it.

In light of the court's ruling, the plaintiff's suit for the recovery of possession of the property was dismissed with costs in all courts. This meant that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover possession of the property and was also liable to pay the costs of the legal proceedings.

Overall, the court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal provisions. The court found that the plaintiff had been dispossessed of the property in question, but that this had been done in due course of law by a revenue court. As such, the civil court had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's suit for the recovery of possession of the property. The court also found that the defendant had no other remedy available to them to establish their title to the property and recover possession. In light of these findings, the court dismissed the plaintiff's suit with costs in all courts.
