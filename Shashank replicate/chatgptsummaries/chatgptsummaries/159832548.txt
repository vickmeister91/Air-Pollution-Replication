Jairam Singh, the accused, filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking regular bail. He was arrested in connection with Crime No.54/2015, registered at Police Station-Chandni, District-Surajpur (CG), for the offence punishable under Section 39(B), 49(A) and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that he was found in possession of one trophy of leopard and had hunted the scheduled animal under the Wild Life Protection Act. However, the applicant denied the allegations and claimed that he was falsely implicated.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed the bail application. The court directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court, for his appearance as and when directed.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act prohibits hunting of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also prohibits the trade in wildlife and wildlife products.

The act provides for the punishment of offenders who violate its provisions. Section 39(B) of the act provides for punishment for hunting of wild animals, while Section 49(A) provides for punishment for possession of any captive animal or bird or any part or derivative thereof. Section 51 of the act provides for punishment for contravention of any provision of the act or any rule or order made thereunder.

In the present case, the prosecution alleged that Jairam Singh had hunted a leopard, which is a scheduled animal under the Wild Life Protection Act, and was found in possession of its trophy. The prosecution argued that Jairam Singh had violated the provisions of Sections 39(B), 49(A), and 51 of the act.

However, Jairam Singh denied the allegations and claimed that he was falsely implicated. He argued that he had no connection with the hunting of the leopard and was not in possession of its trophy. He further argued that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to support its allegations.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed the bail application. The court observed that the allegations against Jairam Singh were not supported by any evidence. The court further observed that Jairam Singh had no criminal antecedents and was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court, therefore, allowed the bail application and directed Jairam Singh to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court, for his appearance as and when directed.

In conclusion, the court allowed the bail application of Jairam Singh, who was arrested in connection with Crime No.54/2015, registered at Police Station-Chandni, District-Surajpur (CG), for the offence punishable under Section 39(B), 49(A) and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court observed that the allegations against Jairam Singh were not supported by any evidence and that he had no criminal antecedents. The court, therefore, directed Jairam Singh to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court, for his appearance as and when directed.
