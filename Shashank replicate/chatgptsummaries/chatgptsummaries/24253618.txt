The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to cases related to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964. The first court order pertains to a criminal petition filed by V.T. Wilson seeking to quash the proceedings against him in C.C. No. 85/2014 for alleged offences punishable under sections 24 and 25 of the Water Prevention and Pollution Control Act, 1974. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against Wilson and the Town Panchayat, T. Narasipura, for discharging untreated sewage into Kabini River, which was adversely affecting public health. Wilson argued that he cannot be held liable for non-implementation of any projects envisaged by the State even if it resulted in violation of any rule of law. He also argued that the prosecution of the petitioner without prior sanction under section 197 Cr.P.C. and section 283 of Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 is illegal, untenable and impermissible.

The court considered whether the actions of the town panchayat constituted a violation of sections 24 and 25 of the Water Act and whether Wilson could be held vicariously liable for their actions. The court also discussed the "Polluter Pays" principle and the legal obligation to provide UGD systems and treat sewage effluent before discharging it into water bodies. Ultimately, the court dismissed the prosecution against Wilson, stating that it is illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Karnataka Municipalities Act and Water Act.

The second court order discussed the conditions and regulations imposed by the State Board on industries, operations, processes, and treatment and disposal systems. The Board can refuse consent and impose conditions on establishments that do not have their consent. The Board must maintain a register of the conditions imposed, and the conditions in the register are conclusive proof that the consent was granted subject to those conditions. The order also discussed the provisions of the Water Act and the Karnataka Municipality Act, which give the municipal council control over drains, sewers, and cesspools. The court rejected the argument that the Board cannot proceed against the Town Panchayat for failing to prevent pollution of water bodies.

The third court order discussed various provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, including the requirement for water-closets and latrines in buildings and public places, the power to close existing private drains, and the consequences for encroaching on municipal drains. The court also considered the liability of government departments and their officials for offences under the Act, and cited a recent Supreme Court decision on corporate criminal liability. The court ultimately rejected the argument that a town panchayat cannot be prosecuted for allowing pollutants to enter lakes and water bodies, and held that the chief officer of the town panchayat can be prosecuted if there is sufficient evidence of his active role and criminal intent.

The fourth court order pertained to the case of Maksud Saiyed vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. The court examined the vicarious liability of directors for charges against a company and held that the Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the managing director or directors of the company when the accused is a company. The court further held that statutes must provide for fixing such vicarious liability and it is obligatory for the complainant to make requisite allegations to attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability. The court dismissed the criminal petition filed by the petitioner/accused No.2.

In summary, these court orders discuss various provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964. The courts have considered the liability of individuals and government departments for offences under these Acts, as well as the "Polluter Pays" principle and the legal obligation to treat sewage effluent before discharging it into water bodies. The courts have also examined the vicarious liability of directors for charges against a company and held that statutes must provide for fixing such liability. Ultimately, the courts have dismissed some of the criminal petitions filed against the accused, while upholding the prosecution of others based on the evidence presented.
