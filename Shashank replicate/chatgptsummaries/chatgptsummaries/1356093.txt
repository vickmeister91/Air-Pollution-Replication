The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Dilipbhai Virkubhai Jalu under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The applicant was charged under sections 66(1)(B), 65(A) (E), 116(B) of the Prohibition Act in connection with I-C.R.No.11 of 2010 registered at Kuvadva Police Station. The court considered the submissions made by both parties and the role attributed to the applicant before ordering that the applicant be granted regular bail on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/- with certain conditions.

The conditions of the bail include surrendering his passport, marking his presence at the concerned Police Station twice a month, and not leaving the State of Gujarat without prior permission. The court also directed that the Trial Court shall not be influenced by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail.

The Prohibition Act, under which the applicant was charged, is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain states of India. The Act was enacted to promote public health and morality by curbing the consumption of alcohol. The charges against the applicant suggest that he was involved in the illegal sale of alcohol, which is a serious offense under the Act.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the role attributed to the applicant, and the likelihood of the applicant fleeing from justice. The court has taken into account the fact that the applicant has been charged with a non-violent offense and that he has no prior criminal record. The court has also considered the fact that the applicant has cooperated with the investigation and has not attempted to flee from justice.

The court has imposed certain conditions on the bail to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or interfere with the investigation. The condition of surrendering his passport is intended to prevent the applicant from leaving the country. The condition of marking his presence at the concerned Police Station twice a month is intended to ensure that the applicant remains in touch with the authorities and does not abscond. The condition of not leaving the State of Gujarat without prior permission is intended to prevent the applicant from fleeing to another state.

The court has also directed that the Trial Court shall not be influenced by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail. This direction is intended to ensure that the Trial Court makes an independent assessment of the evidence and does not rely on the observations made by the High Court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Dilipbhai Virkubhai Jalu under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
