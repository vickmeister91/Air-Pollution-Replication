The case at hand involves a dispute between Shakuntala Devi and Geeta Devi over the payment of rent for a property. Shakuntala Devi had filed an application seeking the striking off of Geeta Devi's defence on the grounds that she had failed to deposit the arrears of rent as per the court's order. Geeta Devi had only deposited Rs. 400/- instead of the directed amount of Rs. 17,200/-. The court found that Geeta Devi had committed a second default in payment of rent and was liable to be evicted from the suit premises.

The court's decision to strike off Geeta Devi's defence was based on the fact that she had failed to comply with the court's order to deposit the arrears of rent. The court had given Geeta Devi several opportunities to comply with the order, but she had failed to do so. As a result, the court found that she had committed a second default in payment of rent and was liable to be evicted from the suit premises.

Geeta Devi's failure to comply with the court's order was a clear violation of the legal process. The court had given her ample opportunity to deposit the arrears of rent, but she had failed to do so. This failure to comply with the court's order was a serious offence and warranted the striking off of her defence.

The court's orders must be obeyed, and failure to do so can result in serious consequences. In this case, Geeta Devi's failure to comply with the court's order resulted in the striking off of her defence and the possibility of eviction from the suit premises.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with court orders and respecting the legal process. Failure to do so can result in serious consequences, as seen in this case where Geeta Devi's defence was struck off and she faced the possibility of eviction from the suit premises. It is important for all parties involved in legal disputes to follow the court's orders and respect the legal process to ensure a fair and just outcome.
