The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by K. Eshter Rajathi against the District Collector and other officials, seeking to quash an order requiring the petitioner to obtain permission for conducting prayer meetings at his residence. The court had earlier directed the petitioner to comply with Rule 6(4) of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Building Rules, 1972, which requires prior approval from the Collector for using a site for public worship or religious purposes. The court has asked the petitioner to produce a copy of such approval if already obtained, and if not, to make an application for the same.

The court order requires the petitioner to provide proof of compliance with statutory provisions for construction of a place of public worship and to explain why certain requirements may not be applicable. The court cites a previous case to emphasize that the right to freedom of religion is subject to public order, morality, and health. The court also notes that rules for controlling noise pollution must be enforced, even though there is a lack of awareness among citizens and authorities.

The court order states that while conducting public worship in residential premises, the petitioner must ensure that no hindrance or disturbance is caused to the general public. The concerned authorities have the right to take necessary action under relevant statutes in case of any nuisance or violation of statutory provisions. The conduct of public worship causing disturbance to the neighborhood cannot be permitted, especially when it is found that it is not possible to grant permission under the relevant rules. The writ petition is dismissed, and the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. No costs are awarded.
