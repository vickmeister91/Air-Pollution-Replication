The National Green Tribunal heard a case brought by Krishan Kant Singh and Social Action for Forest & Environment against various government bodies and companies for discharging toxic effluents into the River Ganga, causing harm to aquatic life and polluting groundwater. The applicants claimed that Simbhaoli Sugar Mills and Gopalji Dairy were among the worst offenders. The court heard evidence of the harmful effects of the effluents and pollution on the environment and human health.

The court order describes a case where three industrial units were found to be causing air and water pollution by discharging untreated effluents into the Simbhaoli drain, which eventually joins the River Ganga. The applicants, who were residents of the area, approached various authorities to address the issue but received no response. The court was approached to restrict the industries from releasing harmful effluents and to direct them to pay for the restoration of the environment. The court noted that pollution is a civil wrong and a violation of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court also noted that the authorities responsible for pollution control cannot sit back on the pretext of financial or other limitations. The court ordered the industries to adhere to the prescribed standards and directed them to pay for the restoration of the environment.

The court order reveals that M/s Simbhaoli Spirits Ltd, a distillery unit, had persistent defaults and breached conditions of consent granted to them. The UPPCB issued a show cause notice to the unit and conducted an inspection, after which the Board forfeited the Bank Guarantee of Rs 5 lakhs and issued directions to the unit to make a wall around the bio composting yard, install a separate sewage treatment plant, and ensure no effluent is discharged outside the premises. The court also noted that the unit had two main sources of air pollution and failed to comply with various directions issued to them. The UPPCB refused consent to the distillery unit for discharge of effluent in public interest. The CPCB regularly monitors the water quality of Rivers and drains and found that the water quality of the Simbhaoli drain was violative of prescribed standards.

The court order discusses the non-compliance of Simbhaoli Sugar Mills Ltd. and Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd. with the prescribed effluent discharge standards. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducted inspections and issued directions to the units to comply with the standards, but they failed to do so. The court has issued a show cause notice to Simbhaoli Sugar Mills Ltd. to close all manufacturing operations until they comply with the directions. The order also mentions deficiencies in the units' infrastructure and storage facilities for effluent.

The court order directs a sugar unit to install an incineration boiler for spent wash management and dismantle unlined lagoons. The unit is also directed to monitor the impact of using treated effluent for irrigation on groundwater. The Gopaljee Dairy Pvt. Ltd. is directed to stabilize the aeration tank and maintain the desired level of MLSS. The Respondent No. 7, Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, denies allegations of pollution and claims to be following all rules and regulations. Respondent No. 8, Gopaljee Dairy Food Pvt. Ltd., claims to be complying with all environmental laws and has installed all devices and machineries required under the terms of the consent given by the respective Boards. Both respondents dispute the findings of the Joint Inspection Team and the results of water analysis.

The court order states that the sample collected by the joint inspection team was done in violation of the law and cannot be relied upon. Respondent no. 8 claims that their ETP was functioning properly and had taken steps to improve its performance. However, both respondents no. 7 and 8 were found to be polluting units, with respondent no. 7 being a serious polluter. The court directed a joint report to be prepared by concerned engineers and the project proponent to address the issues of blockage of drains, establishment of STP, installation of incinerators, raising of effluent from lagoons, and possible points of discharge in the Phuldera drain. The report prepared by the Expert Members found various defects and shortfalls in the functioning of these units and that they were still a source of serious pollution.

The court found that the Simbhaoli Sugar Mills and Distillery Unit were not operating satisfactorily and causing high levels of pollution. The court ordered the unit to improve their treatment facilities, dismantle all bypass arrangements, construct a well-designed drainage system, reduce water consumption, and pay for environmental damages caused by their pollution. The court also directed the unit to install incinerators and automatic monitoring systems to ensure compliance with environmental standards. The court further stated that the unit must submit an action plan and implementation schedule before their consent and permission to operate can be renewed. The court also noted that the unit had been directed to switch to emerging technologies for spent wash treatment, including incineration.

The court order directs a unit to install an incinerator for spent wash treatment, as it is a better technology than bio-composting. The unit had attempted to demonstrate progress towards compliance, but persistent default and resulting pollution require stringent measures. The unit's reasons for not installing incinerators, such as financial burden and negative discrimination, are deemed without merit. The unit cannot claim a right to pollute the environment indiscriminately and
