The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by residents of Banashankari Extension I Stage, Block-1, against the location and operation of industries and industrial enterprises in a residential area in violation of the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act. The petitioners complained of the serious threat to public health on account of environmental hazards posed by the industries and industrial activity. The court considered whether the alleged change in land use in Sy.Nos. 39/1, 39/2A and 39/2B of Yediyur-Nagasandra village, Bangalore, from residential to industrial is in contravention of the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, the Outline Development Plan, the Comprehensive Development Plan and Regulations thereunder. The court also considered whether the Writ Petition is not maintainable on the ground of laches and want of legal right.

The court order discusses the violation of various laws related to land use and development in the Bangalore Metropolitan Area. The court notes that the Outline Development Plan prepared by the Madhava Rao Committee in 1961 earmarked the land for residential use only, but numerous industries were established in the area without proper permission from the Planning Authority. The court also notes that the concerned authorities and industrialists did not file any statement of objections to the allegations made by the petitioners, and therefore, the allegations are presumed to be true. The court concludes that the petitioners have established their case against the authorities and establishments.

The court order states that there is no proof that the transfer of land to industrialists met the requirements of certain Acts. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving the environment and protecting citizens' rights to a clean environment. The court also cites various legal principles and precedents that support citizens' right to bring cases against government agencies or public authorities that are violating the law or causing harm to the public. The court finds that there is sufficient evidence of air and noise pollution affecting the environment and the public, and therefore, the writ petition is allowed.

The court order states that if a government department or public authority is breaking the law in a way that harms many people, anyone affected can bring it to the attention of the court and seek a remedy. The court has the power to enforce the law and protect individual rights. The order also discusses the importance of protecting the environment and the right to a quality life. In this specific case, the court found that the change in land use from residential to industrial in a village in Bangalore was illegal and ordered the pollution to be abated and the industrial units to be stopped. The concerned authorities were given 60 days to implement the order and the petitioners were awarded costs.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of citizens to a clean environment and the importance of following laws related to land use and development. The court's order also highlights the responsibility of government agencies and public authorities to ensure that they are not violating the law or causing harm to the public. The court's decision is a step towards ensuring that industries and industrial enterprises are located in appropriate areas and do not pose a threat to public health and the environment.
