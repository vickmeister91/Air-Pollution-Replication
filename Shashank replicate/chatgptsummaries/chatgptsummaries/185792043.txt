The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by social activists seeking the implementation of an order passed by the court in 2005 related to the appointment of the Chairman and other members of the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA). The court had directed the respondents to take requisite steps for clearing the proposals related to the appointment of the Chairman and other members of the NEAA within 45 days. However, no effective steps were taken by the respondents to reconstitute the NEAA, leading to the filing of the present application.

The court examined the relevant provisions of the NEAA Act and the Rules and found the explanations given by the respondents to be unsatisfactory. The court directed the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India to remain present before the court with the relevant files relating to the appointments of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the NEAA.

The court order discusses the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA) Rules, which outline the salary, allowances, and conditions of service for the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson. The court notes that there are anomalies in the rules, with the first Chairperson receiving the same terms as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, but subsequent Chairpersons receiving the same terms as a Secretary to the Government of India. The court also notes that the NEAA has been rendered non-functional due to the government's failure to fill the vacant positions of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson.

The court emphasizes the importance of the NEAA in adjudicating cases involving environmental pollution and questions the government's unwillingness to correct the anomalies in the NEAA Rules. The NEAA was established to hear appeals against the grant of environmental clearance to projects. However, the government's failure to appoint a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson for over eight and three years respectively has rendered the NEAA ineffective, defeating the purpose of its establishment. This places an unreasonable burden on the High Courts and Supreme Court to deal with all possible PILs that such EIAs may generate.

The court order states that the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA) is currently ineffective and lacks independence due to the appointment of retired bureaucrats who do not possess the required technical expertise. The court directs the Union of India to appoint only persons with special technical knowledge in the area concerning the environment as Members of the NEAA.

The court also directs the Union of India to offer the salary, allowances, and other conditions of service as applicable to a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court to the Chairperson of the NEAA. The Union of India is directed to complete the process of appointing the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the NEAA within 12 weeks and to pay the applicant costs of Rs.20,000 for not complying with the court's previous directions.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by social activists seeking the implementation of an order passed by the court in 2005 related to the appointment of the Chairman and other members of the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA). The court found the explanations given by the respondents to be unsatisfactory and directed the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India to remain present before the court with the relevant files relating to the appointments of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the NEAA.
