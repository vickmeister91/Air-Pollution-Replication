The Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Ajay Kumar in connection with a case involving offences under Sections 379/420/411/34 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 4/40 of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules and Section 15 of the Pollution Control Act. The petitioner was said to be the driver of one of the tractors loaded with illegally mined sand that was seized during a raid.

The court allowed the bail on the condition that the petitioner presents himself before the police or court when required and his bail bond shall be cancelled if he fails to appear on two consecutive occasions. This decision was made after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the arguments put forth by the petitioner's counsel.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was not involved in the illegal mining of sand and was merely a driver who was hired to transport the sand. The counsel further argued that the petitioner had no knowledge of the illegal nature of the sand and was not aware of the fact that it was being transported illegally.

The court took into account the fact that the petitioner had no prior criminal record and was not a flight risk. The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had presented himself before the police when required.

The court, therefore, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner on the condition that he presents himself before the police or court when required and his bail bond shall be cancelled if he fails to appear on two consecutive occasions.

This decision by the Patna High Court highlights the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case before making a decision on bail. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to cooperate with the investigation and present themselves before the police or court when required.
