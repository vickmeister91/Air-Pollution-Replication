The court order in question pertains to a case where an applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to obtain the income tax returns of the respondent for the years 2003-04 and 2004-05. The respondent had lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for issuing two cheques for repayment of an amount taken by him. The learned JMFC Bhopal had dismissed the application filed by the applicant under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court found no illegality or perversity in the impugned order passed by the learned JMFC Bhopal and dismissed the present petition filed by the applicant under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

To understand the court order, it is important to first understand the sections of the Cr.P.C. that are being referred to. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Cr.P.C. or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, the applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to obtain the income tax returns of the respondent for the years 2003-04 and 2004-05. The respondent had lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for issuing two cheques for repayment of an amount taken by him. The applicant had sought the income tax returns to establish the respondent's financial position and to defend himself against the criminal complaint.

However, the learned JMFC Bhopal had dismissed the application filed by the applicant under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court found that the applicant had failed to establish the relevance and necessity of the income tax returns for the purposes of the criminal complaint. The court also found that the applicant had failed to establish that the income tax returns were not already in the possession of the respondent or the investigating agency.

The applicant had then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court challenging the order passed by the learned JMFC Bhopal. However, the High Court found no illegality or perversity in the impugned order passed by the learned JMFC Bhopal and dismissed the present petition filed by the applicant under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The court order highlights the importance of establishing the relevance and necessity of any document or thing that is sought to be produced under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court also emphasizes the need to establish that the document or thing is not already in the possession of the respondent or the investigating agency. The court's decision also underscores the limited scope of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and the need to establish illegality or perversity in the impugned order before challenging it before the High Court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where an applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to obtain the income tax returns of the respondent for the years 2003-04 and 2004-05. The learned JMFC Bhopal had dismissed the application filed by the applicant under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The High Court found no illegality or perversity in the impugned order passed by the learned JMFC Bhopal and dismissed the present petition filed by the applicant under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The court order highlights the importance of establishing the relevance and necessity of any document or thing that is sought to be produced under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the limited scope of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
