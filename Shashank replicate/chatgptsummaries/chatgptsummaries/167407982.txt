The court has granted anticipatory bail to Amjeet Baheliya in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant was accused of standing near the dead bodies of two peacocks and leaving his motorcycle when he saw forest staff. The court allowed the bail application, directing the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the same amount. The applicant must also make himself available for interrogation and abide by the conditions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas.

In this case, Amjeet Baheliya was accused of violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act by standing near the dead bodies of two peacocks. The court, however, has granted him anticipatory bail, which means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with this case. The court has directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the same amount. This is a standard requirement for granting bail in criminal cases.

The court has also directed Amjeet Baheliya to make himself available for interrogation. This means that he will have to cooperate with the investigating authorities and provide them with any information they require. The court has also directed him to abide by the conditions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. This section provides for the conditions that must be fulfilled by a person who has been granted anticipatory bail. These conditions include appearing before the investigating officer as and when required, not leaving the country without the permission of the court, and not tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a significant relief for Amjeet Baheliya. It means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with this case, and he can continue with his normal life. However, it is important to note that the grant of anticipatory bail does not mean that the case against him has been dismissed. The investigation will continue, and if the police find sufficient evidence against him, he may still be charged and prosecuted.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Amjeet Baheliya in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the same amount, make himself available for interrogation, and abide by the conditions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. The grant of anticipatory bail is a significant relief for Amjeet Baheliya, but the investigation will continue, and he may still be charged and prosecuted if the police find sufficient evidence against him.
