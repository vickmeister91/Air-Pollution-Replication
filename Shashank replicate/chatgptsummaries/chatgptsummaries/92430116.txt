The court order in question pertains to a criminal application filed by Ravi Anil Tiwade against the State of Maharashtra. Tiwade is apprehending arrest in connection with an FIR filed against him for allegedly transporting illegally mined sand and assaulting a Circle Officer. Tiwade claims that he was not present at the spot of the incident and that neither the tractor nor the trolley belongs to him.

The court has granted ad-interim protection to Tiwade and ordered his release on bail if he is arrested, on furnishing a PR bond of Rs. 15,000 and a surety in the like amount. This means that Tiwade will be released from custody if he is arrested, provided he pays a bond of Rs. 15,000 and provides a surety of the same amount. The court has also directed Tiwade to cooperate with the investigation and not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The case against Tiwade revolves around allegations that he transported illegally mined sand and assaulted a Circle Officer. Tiwade denies these allegations and claims that he was not present at the spot of the incident. He also denies ownership of the tractor and trolley that were allegedly used in the transportation of the sand.

The court's decision to grant ad-interim protection to Tiwade is significant as it means that he will not be arrested immediately. Instead, he will be released on bail if he is arrested, provided he meets the conditions set by the court. This decision is likely to be welcomed by Tiwade and his supporters, who have been campaigning for his release.

However, it is important to note that the court has also directed Tiwade to cooperate with the investigation and not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. This suggests that the court is taking the allegations against Tiwade seriously and expects him to fully cooperate with the investigation.
