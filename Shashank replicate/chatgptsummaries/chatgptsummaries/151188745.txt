The court order in question pertains to a Letters Patent Appeal that was filed against the dismissal of an Interlocutory Application seeking a stay on a closure notice issued to a brick kiln by the Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur. The appellant had challenged the notice on the grounds that it was polluting the environment and damaging the forest habitat of wild animals. The government had issued a notification prohibiting the running of industries of brick kiln in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary.

The appellant had argued that the closure notice was arbitrary and illegal, and that it had been issued without following the due process of law. The appellant had also contended that the closure notice was based on a flawed and incomplete report, which had not taken into account the actual impact of the brick kiln on the environment and the wildlife habitat.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, disposed of the appeal, giving the appellant liberty to raise all contentions before the learned Single Judge in the pending writ petition. The court held that the appellant had not been able to make out a prima facie case for the grant of a stay on the closure notice, and that the balance of convenience was not in favor of the appellant.

The court observed that the closure notice had been issued in pursuance of a notification issued by the government, which had prohibited the running of industries of brick kiln in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary. The court noted that the government had issued the notification in order to protect the environment and the wildlife habitat, and that the closure notice had been issued in furtherance of the same objective.

The court also observed that the appellant had not been able to show that the closure of the brick kiln would cause irreparable harm to the appellant, or that the appellant had no other remedy available to it. The court held that the appellant had an alternative remedy available to it, namely, to challenge the closure notice in a writ petition before the learned Single Judge.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a Letters Patent Appeal against the dismissal of an Interlocutory Application seeking a stay on a closure notice issued to a brick kiln by the Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur. The court disposed of the appeal, giving the appellant liberty to raise all contentions before the learned Single Judge in the pending writ petition. The court held that the closure notice had been issued in pursuance of a notification issued by the government, which had prohibited the running of industries of brick kiln in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, and that the closure notice had been issued in furtherance of the objective of protecting the environment and the wildlife habitat. The court also held that the appellant had an alternative remedy available to it, namely, to challenge the closure notice in a writ petition before the learned Single Judge.
