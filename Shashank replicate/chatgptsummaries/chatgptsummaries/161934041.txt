In a recent court order, an application filed by the accused/petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for production of PAN Card and the Income Tax Returns pertaining to the complainant was rejected. The petitioner argued that it has nowhere been mentioned in the complaint that cheque worth Rs.12,00,000/- was issued by the petitioner in discharge of some debt or legal liability. However, the court found that in the complaint filed for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, it has been mentioned that the accused - petitioner issued a cheque worth Rs.12,00,000/- in discharge of legal debt to the complainant. The court dismissed the Criminal Misc. Petition filed by the accused-petitioner.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner's argument was not valid as the complaint clearly stated that the cheque was issued in discharge of legal debt. The court also found that the petitioner's request for production of PAN Card and Income Tax Returns of the complainant was not relevant to the case and therefore, rejected the application.

The case was related to an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account. The accused-petitioner had issued a cheque worth Rs.12,00,000/- to the complainant, which was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account. The complainant had then filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused-petitioner.

The court's decision to reject the application filed by the accused-petitioner is significant as it upholds the importance of following legal procedures and adhering to the relevant laws. The court's decision also highlights the need for clarity in complaints filed in legal cases, as any ambiguity or lack of clarity can lead to confusion and delay in the legal process.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the application filed by the accused-petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for production of PAN Card and the Income Tax Returns pertaining to the complainant was based on the fact that the complaint clearly stated that the cheque was issued in discharge of legal debt. The court's decision upholds the importance of following legal procedures and adhering to the relevant laws, and highlights the need for clarity in complaints filed in legal cases.
