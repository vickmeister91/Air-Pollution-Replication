In the first court order, the appellant had filed a claim petition seeking compensation of Rs. 1,60,000/- from the respondents, which was dismissed by the Additional M.A.C.T. The appellant appealed the decision, arguing that the Tribunal had erred in not awarding compensation to him and in holding that the Insurance Company was not liable to pay compensation. The court found that there was an accident between a cycle and a motor cycle on 26.4.1991, but the negligence was shared between the claimant and the rider of the motor cycle. The court also found that the registered owner of the vehicle, respondent No. 2, could not avoid liability for the claimant-third party risk, as he had not complied with Section 31 of the Act. The Insurance Company's only defence was that the rider of the motor cycle had no valid driving licence to drive the vehicle, but the court found that this was not enough to absolve the Insurance Company of liability.

The second court order discusses a case where a third party was injured in a motorcycle accident and the insurance company was being sued for compensation. The insurance company argued that the owner of the motorcycle had breached the policy condition by allowing an unlicensed driver to operate the vehicle, but the court found that the evidence presented was not sufficient to prove this. The court also emphasized that the purpose of insurance is to provide easy compensation for victims of accidents and that technicalities should not be used to defeat their claims.

In the third court order, the court discusses the liability of an insurance company to pay compensation to a third-party claimant in case of an accident involving a vehicle insured by the company. The court emphasizes that the purpose of insurance is to provide an easy mode of compensation to claimants, and the insurance company cannot avoid liability except on the limited grounds set out in the law. The court also notes that the liability of the insurer does not cease even if the owner or purchaser does not give any intimation of transfer of the vehicle to the insurance company. The court awards a sum of Rs. 20,000/- with interest to the claimant, holding him responsible for 60% of the accident.

In all three court orders, the courts emphasize the importance of providing compensation to victims of accidents and holding insurance companies liable for their obligations. The courts also note that technicalities should not be used to defeat the claims of victims and that liability cannot be avoided except on the limited grounds set out in the law. The courts also hold the owners of vehicles responsible for complying with the law and ensuring that their vehicles are insured and that they comply with all the requirements of the law. Overall, these court orders provide important guidance on the liability of insurance companies and the obligations of vehicle owners to ensure that their vehicles are insured and that they comply with all the requirements of the law.
