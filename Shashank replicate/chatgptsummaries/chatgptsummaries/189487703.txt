The court recently issued two orders pertaining to writ petitions filed by different petitioners seeking a refund of the lease amount paid for quarrying operations. In the first case, Saketh India Ltd. filed a writ petition seeking a declaration that the lease amount and security deposit paid for a quarry land in Tamil Nadu is illegal and demanding a refund of the same with interest. The petitioner had participated in a tender for the quarry land and paid the bid amount of Rs. 44,55,000, but was not handed over possession of the land due to it being an unreserved forest area.

The court found that the respondents had not obtained prior permission from the Central Government for quarrying operations in the forest area and that the petitioner was not at fault for not carrying out quarrying operations. The court ordered the refund of the bid amount and held that the respondents cannot claim dead rent or area assessment in lieu of seigniorage fee when the petitioner was not put in possession of the property. The court also directed the respondents to pay interest on the refund amount at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund.

In the second case, a petitioner filed a writ petition seeking a refund of the lease amount paid for quarrying operations. The government pleader argued that the writ petition cannot be maintained as the application for repayment is pending before the government. However, the court held that the case cited by the government pleader is not comparable to the present case. The court directed the respondents to refund the lease amount of Rs. 44,55,000/- to the petitioner within 12 weeks, but denied the petitioner's claim for interest. The writ petition was ordered accordingly, and no costs were awarded.

In both cases, the court ordered the refund of the lease amount paid by the petitioners for quarrying operations. The court found that the respondents had not obtained prior permission from the Central Government for quarrying operations in the forest area, and therefore, the petitioners were not at fault for not carrying out quarrying operations. The court also held that the respondents cannot claim dead rent or area assessment in lieu of seigniorage fee when the petitioner was not put in possession of the property.

However, the court differed in its decision on the payment of interest on the refund amount. In the first case, the court directed the respondents to pay interest on the refund amount at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund. In the second case, the court denied the petitioner's claim for interest.

It is important to note that in both cases, the court held that the lease amount paid by the petitioners for quarrying operations was illegal due to the lack of prior permission from the Central Government for quarrying operations in the forest area. This highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions and approvals before carrying out any operations in forest areas.

Overall, the court's orders in these cases provide relief to the petitioners who had paid lease amounts for quarrying operations but were unable to carry out the operations due to the lack of necessary permissions. The court's decision to order the refund of the lease amount paid by the petitioners emphasizes the importance of following all necessary procedures and obtaining all necessary permissions before carrying out any operations in forest areas.
