In the first court order, the case pertains to a buffalo that died due to electrocution from transmission lines maintained by the petitioners. The respondent filed a claim for compensation under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991, which was granted by the Collector, Satna. The petitioners challenged this order, arguing that the respondent should approach a civil court for compensation. However, the court held that the Act provides for no-fault liability in case of accidents involving hazardous substances, which includes electricity. The court also clarified that electricity is a hazardous substance under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and does not require notification under the Act of 1991. The court upheld the Collector's order for compensation and emphasized the strict liability without fault in such cases.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the liability of those responsible for accidents involving hazardous substances. The court's ruling that electricity is a hazardous substance under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is particularly noteworthy as it expands the scope of the Act beyond traditional hazardous substances like chemicals and pollutants. The court's emphasis on strict liability without fault in such cases is also significant as it places the burden of compensation on those responsible for accidents, regardless of whether they were negligent or not.

In the second court order, a writ petition is dismissed, and the Board is held liable for generating, transforming, and transmitting electricity. The Board cannot escape liability by claiming no policy was taken. No costs are awarded, and the order is certified as per rules.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it holds the Board liable for accidents involving electricity, regardless of whether they had a policy in place or not. This decision reinforces the principle of strict liability without fault in cases involving hazardous substances, including electricity. The court's decision not to award costs is also noteworthy as it emphasizes the importance of holding those responsible for accidents accountable, rather than punishing them financially.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of strict liability without fault in cases involving hazardous substances, including electricity. They also emphasize the need for those responsible for accidents to be held accountable, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. These principles are essential for protecting the environment and ensuring that those affected by accidents involving hazardous substances receive the compensation they deserve.
