The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Dr. Herschel Dafal. The applicant had filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, seeking a delay of 100 days in filing the revision. However, the court found that the reason for the delay was not satisfactory and dismissed the application.

The court also noted that the applicant had moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to get the original report by which a handwriting expert gave his opinion. However, the court found that the applicant had an opportunity to get the original document at the time of framing of the charges and dismissed the revision.

The case highlights the importance of timely filing of applications and the need for valid reasons for any delay. In this case, the court found that the reason for the delay was not satisfactory and therefore dismissed the application. This serves as a reminder to litigants to ensure that they file their applications within the prescribed time limit and provide valid reasons for any delay.
