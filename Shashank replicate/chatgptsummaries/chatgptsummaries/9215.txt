The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner was facing prosecution under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The petitioner had filed for exemption from personal appearance on the grounds of suffering from hypertension, which was supported by a medical certification. However, the learned Trial Court did not grant the exemption and ordered the cancellation of bail and issuance of warrants for the petitioner's arrest.

The petitioner then filed an anticipatory bail plea, which was declined, and was advised to surrender before the Trial Court and apply for regular bail. The court found the petitioner's plea to be unsustainable and dismissed the petition, but allowed the verbal request of the petitioner's counsel for a direction to the Trial Court to decide the bail plea on the next date of hearing.

The court's decision to deny the petitioner's request for exemption from personal appearance and subsequent cancellation of bail and issuance of warrants for arrest may seem harsh, but it is important to note that the petitioner was facing charges under a serious environmental protection law. The court likely deemed it necessary for the petitioner to appear in person to face the charges against them.

Furthermore, the court's decision to deny the anticipatory bail plea and advise the petitioner to surrender and apply for regular bail is in line with the legal process. Anticipatory bail is granted in exceptional circumstances, and the court likely did not find the petitioner's case to meet the criteria for such bail.

The court's dismissal of the petition and direction to the Trial Court to decide the bail plea on the next date of hearing is a reasonable decision. The Trial Court will have the opportunity to review the bail plea and make a decision based on the facts and circumstances of the case.

Overall, the court's order in this case appears to be a fair and just decision based on the facts and circumstances presented. It is important to remember that the legal process is designed to ensure that justice is served, and the court's decisions are made with this goal in mind.
