The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently disposed of four civil writ petitions filed by stone crusher units against an order issued by the State Pollution Control Board. The order had asked the units to comply with an order passed by the National Green Tribunal and submit a compliance report within seven days. The court noted that some of the stone crusher units had challenged the NGT order before the Supreme Court, which had granted them three months' time to move the tribunal for review or modification of the order.
