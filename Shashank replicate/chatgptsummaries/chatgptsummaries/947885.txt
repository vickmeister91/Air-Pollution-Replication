The Supreme Court of India has issued a court order directing the closure of an industry, respondent No. 6, for failing to comply with directions issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to ensure proper storage and treatment of effluent. The court has ordered the industry to close its operations by February 2, 1998. The court has also requested the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to conduct an inspection of the industry and surrounding area to assess the damage caused by the discharge of effluent and to indicate the cost of restitution.

The court order was issued in response to a petition filed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, which alleged that respondent No. 6 had been discharging untreated effluent into the environment, causing damage to the surrounding area. The court found that the industry had failed to comply with the directions issued by the Pollution Control Board to ensure proper storage and treatment of effluent.

The court order clarifies that the closure order will not prevent the industry from emptying its unlined lagoons or conducting compost work. However, the industry will not be allowed to resume operations until it has complied with the directions issued by the Pollution Control Board and has taken steps to ensure that its operations do not cause further damage to the environment.

The court has also requested NEERI to assess the damage caused by the discharge of effluent and to indicate the cost of restitution. This is an important step in ensuring that the industry is held accountable for the damage it has caused and that steps are taken to restore the environment to its previous state.

The court order is significant because it demonstrates the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the consequences of failing to do so. The closure of the industry sends a strong message to other industries that they must take steps to ensure that their operations do not cause harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has issued a court order directing the closure of an industry for failing to comply with environmental regulations. The court has requested NEERI to assess the damage caused by the discharge of effluent and to indicate the cost of restitution. This court order is significant because it demonstrates the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the consequences of failing to do so.
