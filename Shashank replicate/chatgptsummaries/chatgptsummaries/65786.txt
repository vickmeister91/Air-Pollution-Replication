The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to environmental concerns and the preservation of natural resources in India. The first case involves a writ petition filed by the Consumer Action Group to stop the construction of a memorial to Dr. Ambedkar on a low-lying area in Mylapore village. The group claimed that the construction violated forest conversion laws, threatened groundwater recharge, and contravened development control rules. The government of Tamil Nadu argued that the memorial was necessary to perpetuate the memory of Dr. Ambedkar and that the area was not classified as forest land. The Madras Metropolitan Development Authority stated that the land was partly categorized as "Open space and Recreational" and partly under "Institutional" and partly in "Commercial Use Zones," and that memorials, botanical gardens, waterfront developments, office complexes, and transportation terminals were permissible under these zones. The fourth respondent, the M.M.D.A., proposed an eco-friendly development scheme called "Development of Urban Forest in Adyar Creek Area," which included an urban forest, flood moderation ponds, walkways, resting places, and boating facilities.

The second case discussed in the court order concerns the construction of an auditorium on wetlands in the Adyar estuary. The petitioner argued that the wetlands should be preserved for their potential to maintain the ecosystem and become a bird sanctuary or water resource. The court cited Article 48-A and 51-A of the Constitution of India, which state that it is the duty of the state and citizens to protect and improve the environment and natural resources of the country. The court also referred to various books and cases that support the preservation of wetlands. Ultimately, the court restrained the conversion of wetlands for the construction of the auditorium and directed the respondents to maintain the wetlands in their existing form.

The third case involves an order restraining the respondents from reclaiming any further wetland and from granting permission to change the use of agricultural land to any other purpose. The court directed the respondents to maintain the character of all wetlands in their existing form. The court relied on several paragraphs of a judgment of the Calcutta High Court to weigh the balance of interest between the benefits of retaining wetlands and the benefits of development. The court also considered the Town and Country Planning Act and the Development Rules, which restrict the use of land designated as "Open Space and Recreational" for certain purposes. The court referred to various judgments, including one that protects the environment and wildlife in protected areas. The court suggested that a better way to perpetuate the memory of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and propagate his ideals would be to create a fund or endowment and run a free hostel for students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The fourth case permits the construction of a memorial or monument in an extent of 1.5 acres at the eastern end of a five-acre plot allotted to the Adi Dravida Housing Development Corporation. The court also directs respondents 1 to 6 to remove the sands spread on the western side of the plot and restore the area to its original position. Respondents 1 to 6 are restrained from constructing any building other than what is permitted under the court order. The low-lying wetland in Survey No. 4309 and its sub-divisions shall be maintained and preserved as low-lying wetlands, and no construction of any type shall be permitted or authorized. The parties may seek appropriate directions from the court in the future if necessary.

In all of these cases, the court is balancing the interests of development and preservation of natural resources. The court is also considering the constitutional duty of the state and citizens to protect and improve the environment and natural resources of the country. The court is relying on various laws, rules, and judgments to make its decisions. In some cases, the court is suggesting alternative ways to achieve the goals of development and preservation. Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of balancing development and preservation in a sustainable manner.
