S. Mallikarjuna Reddy had filed two separate criminal petitions seeking anticipatory bail in two cases where he was accused of obstructing the duties of public servants and causing hurt to them. The court, however, dismissed both the petitions and directed Reddy to surrender before the lower court and obtain regular bail.

The court observed that the allegations against Reddy were serious in nature and not fit for anticipatory bail. The court also noted that Reddy had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to appear before the investigating officer despite several notices.

The court further directed the lower court to dispose of the bail applications expeditiously and not to grant any unnecessary adjournments. The court emphasized that the lower court should consider the bail applications on their merits and not be influenced by any extraneous considerations.

The court's decision to dismiss Reddy's anticipatory bail petitions is significant as it sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate any obstruction of the duties of public servants.
