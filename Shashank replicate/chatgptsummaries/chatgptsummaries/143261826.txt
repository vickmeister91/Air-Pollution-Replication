The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant, Dinesh, challenged the dismissal of his application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. by the Seventh Additional Sessions Judge. The applicant had filed the application to call for the investigation report of S.P. Sagar and the statement of witnesses. However, the court ruled that there is no provision in the Cr.P.C. for a parallel inquiry by any police officer and that witnesses cannot be contradicted by statements given before the inquiry officer. The trial court had rightly dismissed the application, and there was no illegality or perversity visible in the impugned order. Consequently, the present petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant Dinesh is dismissed at motion stage.
