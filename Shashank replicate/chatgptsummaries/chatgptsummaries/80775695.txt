The court order pertains to multiple cases involving Salman Khan and Gordhan Singh. Salman Khan had filed a criminal revision petition against his conviction and sentence under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, while the State had filed an appeal against the acquittal of Gordhan Singh under the same section. The court provided a detailed background of the case, including the registration of FIRs and the evidence presented by the prosecution.

In the case involving Salman Khan, the court upholds his conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. However, the court allows the acquittal of Gordhan Singh. The court also discusses the use of the statement of an eyewitness, Harish Dulani, who was allegedly kept in custody and never made available for cross-examination. The court finds that the accused did not get an opportunity to cross-examine the witness and therefore, his statement cannot be used as evidence.

The court further discusses the lack of cross-examination of witness Harish Dulani in the Salman Khan case. The court finds that the trial court's conclusion that Salman Khan's counsel did not cross-examine Dulani is incorrect and that the prosecution did not make enough effort to produce Dulani for cross-examination. The court also finds that Dulani's statement is unreliable and cannot be used as evidence against Salman Khan. The case rests solely on circumstantial evidence, and the court questions whether the gypsy allegedly used in the crime was actually hired by the film unit.

In another case involving the alleged use of a gypsy vehicle in a hunting incident, the court discusses the lack of evidence. The owner of the gypsy testified that he had purchased it for personal use and had never rented it out. There were no eyewitnesses to prove the use of the gypsy in the incident. The prosecution relied on the recovery of blood and tyre moulds, but there were discrepancies in the evidence and serious doubts about whether the recovery was related to the alleged hunting. The court ultimately found that the evidence was insufficient to uphold the conviction.

The court also discusses the lack of evidence in a case involving Salman Khan and his alleged involvement in hunting and killing a deer. The driver of the vehicle, Harish Dulani, could not provide information about the location of the incident, and the FSL report did not confirm that the hair and tail found belonged to a deer. The court also questions the reliability of the statement made by a co-accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, as it was introduced by the police and not mentioned by the eyewitness. The court concludes that the evidence is insufficient and weak, and therefore, Salman Khan cannot be convicted.

In another criminal case involving Salman Khan and others, the court questions the reliability of the evidence presented by the prosecution, including the recovery of blood stains, hair, and pellets from a gypsy, the recovery of weapons from Salman Khan's room and Uday Raghwan, and the seizure of an air rifle from Saif Ali Khan. The court notes inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses and raises doubts about the custody and handling of the evidence. Overall, the court suggests that the prosecution has failed to establish a clear link between the evidence and the alleged crime.

The court also discusses the prosecution's attempt to prove the recovery of weapons from Salman Khan's room in a hotel in Jodhpur, India. The court finds that the evidence presented by the prosecution is unreliable and suspicious, including witness testimonies and recovered documents. The court also notes that the prosecution failed to prove that Salman Khan used the firearms for illegal hunting without a license. The court ultimately acquits Salman Khan of the charges.

In the final case, the court states that the pellets recovered from the scene of the alleged hunting do not match with the ones recovered from Salman Khan or Saif Ali Khan's room. The prosecution was unable to establish the weapon used for hunting, leading to Salman Khan's acquittal of the offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act. Therefore, the revision petition filed by Salman Khan is allowed, and he is acquitted of the charges levelled against him. The appeal filed by the State against Gordhan Singh is also dismissed.

In conclusion, the court order discusses multiple cases involving Salman Khan and Gordhan Singh. The court questions the reliability of the evidence presented by the prosecution and finds that the evidence is insufficient and weak in some cases. The court ultimately upholds Salman Khan's conviction and sentence in one case, while allowing the acquittal of Gordhan Singh in the same case. In other cases, Salman Khan is acquitted of the charges levelled against him due to the lack of evidence.
