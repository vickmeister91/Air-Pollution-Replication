The Rajasthan High Court recently issued an order in the case of M/s Associated Stone Industries vs State of Rajasthan on June 1, 2019. The case pertained to the issuance of Ravanna to mining units in the state of Rajasthan. Ravanna is a document that certifies that a mining unit has obtained all necessary permissions and clearances from the relevant authorities to carry out mining activities.

The court observed that if an application for renewal of consent under Air/Water Act is submitted by the lessee at least 90 days prior to its expiry and the matter of consent is not determined by the Board within the stipulated time period, the Mines Department is not to stop issuance of Ravanna to the Mining Units. This means that if a lessee has applied for renewal of consent and the Board has not taken a decision on the matter within the prescribed time period, the Mines Department cannot withhold the issuance of Ravanna to the mining unit.

The court also directed the respondents to issue Ravanna to the petitioner if otherwise eligible. This means that if the petitioner has fulfilled all necessary requirements and is eligible for the issuance of Ravanna, the respondents are directed to issue the same to the petitioner.

The order is significant as it provides clarity on the process of issuance of Ravanna to mining units in the state of Rajasthan. It also ensures that mining units are not unduly penalized for delays caused by the authorities in the renewal of consent process.

The order is likely to have a positive impact on the mining industry in the state of Rajasthan. It will provide greater certainty to mining units and enable them to plan their operations more effectively. It will also reduce the risk of unnecessary litigation and disputes between mining units and the authorities.

Overall, the order is a welcome development for the mining industry in the state of Rajasthan. It provides clarity and certainty on the process of issuance of Ravanna and ensures that mining units are not unduly penalized for delays caused by the authorities.
