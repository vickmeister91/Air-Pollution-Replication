The case of Brij Mohan Sharma, a petitioner, was brought before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.7 in Jaipur City, Jaipur. Sharma had filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order passed by the magistrate, which had rejected two applications under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and another under Section 73 of the Evidence Act. The petitioner had filed these applications to get the cheque sent to the FSL report. However, the court dismissed the petition as the petitioner had not filed any FIR against the complainant and had been filing applications with the intention of prolonging the proceedings.

The case revolved around a cheque that had been issued by the complainant to the petitioner. The petitioner had alleged that the cheque had bounced, and he had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to get the cheque sent to the FSL report. The complainant had opposed this application, stating that the petitioner had not filed any FIR against him and that the application was filed with the intention of prolonging the proceedings.

The court had rejected the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and had also rejected another application filed by the petitioner under Section 73 of the Evidence Act. The petitioner had filed this application to get the cheque sent to the FSL report, but the court had rejected it on the grounds that the petitioner had not filed any FIR against the complainant.

The petitioner had then filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order passed by the magistrate. The petitioner had argued that the order passed by the magistrate was illegal and arbitrary and that it violated his fundamental rights. The petitioner had also argued that the magistrate had not considered the evidence on record and had passed the order without giving any reasons.

The court, however, had dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had not filed any FIR against the complainant and had been filing applications with the intention of prolonging the proceedings. The court had also observed that the petitioner had not made out any case for interference under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In conclusion, the case of Brij Mohan Sharma was dismissed by the court as the petitioner had not filed any FIR against the complainant and had been filing applications with the intention of prolonging the proceedings. The court had also observed that the petitioner had not made out any case for interference under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
