The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Sonu Kabra, who was seeking regular bail in a case registered against him under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972. The petitioner had been in custody since April 2, 2017, and was not apprehended at the spot. The court has allowed the petition and granted bail to the petitioner, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The Wild Life Protection Act 1972 is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and other illegal activities. Section 9/51 of the Act deals with the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary or national park without a permit. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with a fine, or with both.

In this case, Sonu Kabra was accused of hunting in a sanctuary or national park without a permit. He had been in custody since April 2, 2017, and had filed a petition seeking regular bail. The court has now granted him bail, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The grant of bail is a significant development in this case, as it allows the petitioner to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. Bail is a legal right that is available to all accused persons, subject to certain conditions. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person attends the trial and does not abscond or tamper with evidence.

In this case, the court has granted bail to the petitioner subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the Trial Court will have to be satisfied that the petitioner will attend the trial and not abscond or tamper with evidence. The Trial Court may impose certain conditions on the petitioner, such as requiring him to surrender his passport or report to the police station regularly.

The grant of bail is not a reflection of the petitioner's guilt or innocence. It is merely a procedural step that allows the accused person to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. The trial will continue, and the petitioner will have to prove his innocence before the court.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a petition filed by Sonu Kabra seeking regular bail in a case registered against him under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972. The court has granted bail to the petitioner subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The grant of bail is a significant development in this case, as it allows the petitioner to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. The trial will continue, and the petitioner will have to prove his innocence before the court.
