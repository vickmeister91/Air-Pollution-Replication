The court order pertains to a batch of Civil Revision Petitions filed by the District Forest Officer and the State of Tamil Nadu against Sulochana. The petitioners sought to set aside an order passed by the Additional District Judge, Fast Tract Court, Namakkal in I.A. No.232/2006 in unnumbered CMA of 2006, dated 23.062011. The delay in filing the appeal ranged between 1000 to 1100 days. The subject lands were acquired by the Government in 1955 and were declared as Reserve Forest Lands. The Forest Settlement Officer excluded the lands of the claimants from the Reserve Forest Area without getting sanction/approval of the Government.

The court heard the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the petitioners and noticed that no one had entered appearance on behalf of the respondent in all CRPs, except in CRP No.3347 of 2014. The court allowed the Civil Revision Petitions and quashed the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition to condone the delay.

In another case involving forest lands, the court discusses the delay in filing appeals by the Forest Department due to efforts to verify records. The court accepts the reasons for the delay and allows the department to contest the remaining cases on merits by condoning the delay in filing the appeals. The court also notes that the government had extended the period for filing an appeal due to various reasons, including the delay in receiving orders and the need to verify records.

The court order also discusses the Forest Settlement Officer's failure to follow proper procedures and the District Forest Officer's actions to file appeals against the admitted claims. The government has accepted the reasons for the delay in filing the appeals, and the court has dismissed a civil revision petition regarding the applicability of Section 10 (2) of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act to the case. The court also notes that the reasons for condoning the delay in filing the appeals have been disputed.

In yet another case, the appeal was not filed in time due to the misplaced case and inability to trace it. The court below accepted the reasons for condoning the delay and exercised its discretion in the interest of justice. The court cannot interfere with the finding of the court below, and the delay in filing the appeals has to be condoned. The subsequent developments have not been brought to the notice of the court below for examination, and the delay in filing the appeals has to be condoned. The Civil Revision Petitions are allowed, and the applications filed by the revision petitioners under Section 5 of the Limitation Act in unnumbered Civil Miscellaneous Appeals are allowed.

Finally, the court has granted the petitioners' request for condonation of delay in filing their appeal under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act.
