The Supreme Court of India recently passed a judgment in a case involving the State of Chhattisgarh and Shyamlal regarding the lease of a forest land. The case pertained to a second appeal filed by the State of Chhattisgarh against Shyamlal, and the substantial question of law involved was whether the land, recorded as 'Chhote Jhad Ka Jangle', could be leased out without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2(iii) of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The trial court had dismissed the suit, while the first appellate court had reversed the finding and granted the decree in favor of the plaintiff. However, the Supreme Court has now held that the term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of ownership, and that prior approval of the Central Government is required for assigning forest land by way of lease or otherwise to any private person or authority. The court has set aside the first appellate court's judgment and decree.

The court order discusses the requirement of prior approval from the Central Government for the diversion of forest land for any other purpose, as per Section 2 of the Act of 1980. The court cites various cases where this requirement has been upheld, and concludes that the lease of forest land without prior approval is unjustified. The court also notes that the suit itself may not be maintainable as the relief sought does not include setting aside the order revoking the lease.

The judgment and decree of the trial court are restored, and the second appeal is allowed. This means that the lease of the forest land in question is now deemed to be illegal, and the State of Chhattisgarh will have to take appropriate action to ensure that the land is not used for any purpose other than what is permitted under the law.

The Supreme Court's judgment in this case is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the leasing of forest land in India. The court has made it clear that prior approval of the Central Government is mandatory for any assignment of forest land, and that the term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of ownership. This will have important implications for the management and conservation of forest land in India, as it will help to ensure that such land is not misused or exploited for commercial purposes.

Overall, the court order in this case is an important development in the legal framework governing forest land in India. It underscores the need for strict adherence to the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and highlights the importance of protecting India's forests and wildlife for future generations.
