The court orders discussed in this article pertain to various writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and its officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The first court order was issued on September 29, 2016, in response to a writ petition filed by Harbans Singh and Satvindra Singh. The case originated from a previous writ petition filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canals and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The second court order discusses a case regarding pollution in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal. The court directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples and analyze them. The state is also directed to come up with short-term and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The court imposes a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this penalty. The court also requests the High Court to hand over the records of WP No. 718/2009. The state is directed to submit a long-term and short-term plan and an action report. The court imposes a cost if the state fails to submit the plan and report. The District Collector, Ganga Nagar, is directed to be present on the next date of hearing.

The third court order discusses the State of Rajasthan's failure to comply with directions to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The court directs the State to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those contributing to pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and deposit it in the Environmental Relief Fund. The State is also directed to remove structures meant for canal maintenance that contribute to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The compliance report is to be filed by 29th January 2016.

The fourth court order ordered the State Government to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- to be deposited in the Environment Relief Fund. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and for a compliance report to be filed. The court expressed disappointment with the lack of compliance and warned of appropriate action if the directions were not followed. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal to provide complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues. The court emphasized the importance of protecting fundamental and constitutional rights and the need to exhaust all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The fifth court order explains that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court has the discretion to insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy if that is efficacious. In the case at hand, the court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Such application/representation shall be filed by 31st December, 2016. Till 31st December, 2016, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s).
