In a recent case, the Chief Wildlife Warden seized a tiger skin from the possession of the petitioner, who argued that the search and seizure were illegal. The court considered the case and found that the seizure was indeed illegal as the authorized officer did not give notice to the declarant before conducting an inquiry and coming to a conclusion as to whether the trophy was kept illegally. As a result, the court allowed the writ petition and ordered costs of Rs. 1,000/-.

The case was brought under Section 40 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which provides for the declaration of trophies and other articles derived from wild animals. The section requires that any person who possesses such a trophy or article must declare it to the Chief Wildlife Warden or any other authorized officer within a specified period. Failure to do so can result in the seizure of the trophy or article.

In this case, the petitioner had declared the tiger skin to the Chief Wildlife Warden, but the authorized officer did not give notice before conducting an inquiry and seizing the trophy. The petitioner argued that this was a violation of their rights and that the seizure was therefore illegal.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and found that the seizure was indeed illegal. The court noted that the authorized officer had not followed the proper procedure for conducting an inquiry and coming to a conclusion as to whether the trophy was kept illegally. Specifically, the officer had not given notice to the declarant before conducting the inquiry, which was a violation of the declarant's rights.

As a result, the court allowed the writ petition and ordered costs of Rs. 1,000/-. This decision serves as a reminder that authorized officers must follow proper procedures when conducting inquiries and seizures under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Failure to do so can result in the violation of the rights of declarants and the illegal seizure of trophies and other articles derived from wild animals.
