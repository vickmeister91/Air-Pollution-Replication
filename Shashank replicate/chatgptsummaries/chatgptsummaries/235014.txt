The court order pertains to a dispute over the collection of tolls from trucks carrying cargo in the state of Meghalaya, India. The dispute involved various entities, including weighbridge operators, local tribal chiefs, pollution control authorities, and police officers. The court heard a batch of six matters related to the legality of collection of monies by the operators of the weighbridges, while other writ petitions relating to the establishment of toll gates and collection of monies by other agencies were to be determined later. The court also listed the various check gates and the tolls collected at each.

The court order mentions a Memorandum dated 11th September 2003, which lays down procedures for granting permission for installation and operation of weighbridges for commercial and regulatory purposes. The court also mentions a writ petition filed by the respondent Shallang Area Coal Dealer and Truck Owner Association, which mentions 16 points at which the driver/owners of the trucks are subjected to extortionate payments exacted without any authority of law. The High Court recognized that weighbridges can be established in terms of the Act but in the absence of any Rules framed in this behalf, no fee can be collected. The court also mentions that the Act provides for registration of the Motor Vehicles and specifies the weight which a carrier of a given description may carry. Section 114 of the Act gives power to have a vehicle weighed.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act regarding the weighing of vehicles and the consequences of exceeding weight limits. It also addresses the power of the State Government to make rules and levy fees. The court concludes that even if rules have not been framed, the provisions of the Act must be followed and non-compliance is imperative. The court also considers the right to carry out trade and business under Article 301 of the Constitution. The court order does not fully address the second contention raised in the writ petition.

The court order discusses the authority of the state to collect fees for services rendered and the regulations surrounding private parties setting up weighbridges. The court cites previous cases to support their opinion that the state is entitled to charge a reasonable amount for services rendered and that the levy of charges towards rendering services does not infringe upon the rights of any person. The court also distinguishes between a tax, a fee, and a compensatory tax.

The court order discusses the difference between a tax and a fee, stating that a tax is not based on a specific benefit and is not measurable, while a fee is based on the principle of equivalence and is measurable. The court also mentions that rules may be followed even if they are not in accordance with statutory provisions, and that the High Court must give an opportunity to the State and other interested parties to present their respective cases before making a decision. The appeals are allowed and no costs are awarded.

In summary, the court order addresses a dispute over the collection of tolls from trucks carrying cargo in the state of Meghalaya, India. The court found that the Memorandum issued by the government of Meghalaya was illegal and directed them to make rules in accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act. The court also discussed the provisions of the Act regarding the weighing of vehicles and the consequences of exceeding weight limits, as well as the authority of the state to collect fees for services rendered and the regulations surrounding private parties setting up weighbridges. The court distinguished between a tax, a fee, and a compensatory tax and allowed the appeals without awarding any costs.
