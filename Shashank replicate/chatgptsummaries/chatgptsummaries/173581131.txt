In the first court order, the accused was charged with offenses under the Wild Life Act. The prosecution alleged that the accused was caught with three elephant tusks in his possession. However, the court found that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the accused was acquitted of all charges, and the property seized was confiscated to the state.

The Wild Life Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including elephants. The possession of any part of a wild animal, such as tusks, is also illegal under this law.

In this case, the prosecution alleged that the accused was caught with three elephant tusks in his possession. However, the court found that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that the prosecution failed to provide enough evidence to convince the court that the accused was guilty of the charges.

As a result, the accused was acquitted of all charges. This means that he was found not guilty of the charges and was released from custody. However, the property seized, which in this case were the three elephant tusks, was confiscated to the state. This means that the state took possession of the property as it was obtained illegally.
