The Patna High Court recently issued a final order in the case of Pawan Stone Works and others against the State of Bihar and others. The case revolved around an application submitted by the petitioners to the Pollution Control Board for the renewal of their consent to operate a stone crushing unit. The Board rejected the application on the grounds that the unit was causing pollution and violating environmental norms.

The petitioners challenged the Board's decision in court, arguing that the rejection was arbitrary and without basis. They also contended that the Board had not followed due process in rejecting their application.

The Pollution Control Board, on the other hand, argued that the Member Secretary had not rejected the application but had communicated the reasons for the Chairman's rejection. The Board maintained that the Chairman had rejected the application on the basis of a report submitted by the Regional Officer, which had found that the unit was causing pollution and violating environmental norms.

After hearing both sides, the court found that the Chairman had not provided a self-explanatory and self-contained order and had simply affixed his signature to recommendations without passing a final verdict. The court observed that the Chairman's order did not specify the reasons for the rejection and did not provide any opportunity for the petitioners to respond to the allegations made against them.

The court, therefore, quashed the orders and notice issued by the Board and directed the Chairman to pass a reasoned order. The court also ordered the Chairman and Secretary to pay Rs. 1000/- each as cost to each of the petitioners.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of due process and the need for authorities to provide clear and specific reasons for their decisions. The court's ruling also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, particularly in matters related to the environment and public health.

Overall, the court's decision in the case of Pawan Stone Works and others against the State of Bihar and others serves as a reminder that the rule of law and due process must be upheld at all times, and that decisions made by authorities must be based on sound reasoning and evidence.
