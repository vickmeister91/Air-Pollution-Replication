The first court order pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Dr. Nawal Prakash Deepak against the Union of India and others. The petitioner was charged with misconduct during a written test for appointment of staff in ESIC Model Hospital, Patna. The inquiry officer exonerated the petitioner, but the disciplinary authority disagreed and imposed a punishment of withholding three increments with cumulative effect. The petitioner challenged this punishment, arguing that the disagreement note should have been communicated separately before serving a show-cause notice. The court rejected this argument and upheld the punishment.

The court order states that once the Disciplinary Authority disagrees with the findings of the Inquiry Officer, there is no need for another show-cause notice. The proposed punishment is only to seek a response from the delinquent. The court also mentions that the petitioner was made aware of the fact that he was exonerated by the Inquiry Officer but the Disciplinary Authority disagreed with the findings and proposed a punishment. The court found no illegality or irregularity in the decision-making process or in the order of punishment. The role of the court in disciplinary proceedings is to examine the decision-making process and not the ultimate decision.

The second court order from 2016 pertains to a case involving Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Coal India Ltd. and others. The court held that the High Court cannot act as a court of appeal and examine the findings of an inquiry officer. If the delinquent admits to the charges and there is no procedural illegality or irregularity in the conduct of the departmental enquiry, the charges stand proved and warrant no interference. The court found no error in the order passed by the Tribunal and dismissed the Writ Application.
