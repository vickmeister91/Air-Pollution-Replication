The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint filed by Vipan Kumar against Bajwa Developers Ltd. Kumar alleged that he had purchased a plot from the company, but the agreement was in contravention of the PAPRA Act and the company had not started any development work at the site. Kumar sought a refund of Rs. 31,87,750/- along with 18% interest, Rs. 6,09,000/- paid towards rent, and Rs. 2 lac as compensation for mental harassment and financial loss. The company contested the complaint, claiming that it was time-barred, Kumar was not a consumer, and the complaint was frivolous and vexatious. The company also claimed that the plot was purchased for commercial use and that Kumar had not paid the remaining amount of the total sale consideration.

After hearing both parties, the commission found that the company had violated the PAPRA Act and had not started any development work at the site. The commission also found that Kumar was a consumer and that the complaint was not frivolous or vexatious. The commission ordered the company to refund the entire amount paid by Kumar along with 18% interest. The commission also ordered the company to pay Rs. 6,09,000/- towards rent and Rs. 2 lac as compensation for mental harassment and financial loss.

In another court order, a buyer had filed a complaint against a developer for collecting money from him before obtaining necessary approvals for a residential project. The court found that the developer had violated various regulations and directed them to refund the entire amount paid by the buyer along with interest and pay compensation for mental harassment and litigation costs. The court also noted that the developer had not provided any evidence to rebut the complainant's claims.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of developers obtaining necessary approvals before collecting money from buyers. It also emphasizes the need for developers to provide evidence to support their claims and to comply with regulations to avoid legal action.

In conclusion, these court orders demonstrate the importance of consumer protection and the need for developers to comply with regulations and provide evidence to support their claims. The orders also highlight the role of the courts in ensuring that justice is served and that consumers are protected from fraudulent or illegal practices.
