In 2014, the Jain Shwetamber Kalyanaktirth Nayas filed a writ petition seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and for issuing 'formal approval' for diversion of forest land for the construction of a temple. The MoEF had given 'in principle approval' subject to certain conditions, which the petitioner had fulfilled. However, the MoEF later withdrew the approval without giving any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The petitioner argued that the withdrawal was contradictory to the guidelines and clarifications issued by MoEF and against the principles of natural justice. The court reserved its decision on 15th May, 2014, and delivered its judgment on 28th July, 2014.

The court order discusses a dispute over the diversion of forest land for the development of a temple. The court concludes that the proposed diversion violates guidelines under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which only permit diversion for community benefit projects such as schools and hospitals. The court also rejects the petitioner's claim of violation of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of larger public interest in environmental protection and development.

The court emphasizes that individual or smaller public interests must yield to the larger public interest, particularly in cases where protecting the environment is essential. The court dismisses a writ petition for the construction of a temple, stating that the interests of the religious community cannot supersede the interests of the public at large in protecting the environment.

The court order also discusses the principles of sustainable development, including the right to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature, inter-generational equity, and the precautionary principle. The Rio Conference resulted in treaties on climate change and biodiversity, as well as the adoption of Agenda 21 which covers topics such as protection of the environment and waste management.

The court's decision is based on the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which only permits diversion of forest land for community benefit projects such as schools and hospitals. The court concludes that the proposed diversion for the construction of a temple does not fall under the category of community benefit projects and therefore violates the guidelines under the Act.

The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the larger public interest. The court dismisses the petitioner's claim of violation of natural justice, stating that the withdrawal of approval by MoEF was not contradictory to the guidelines and clarifications issued by MoEF.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of sustainable development, which emphasize the importance of protecting the environment and promoting development in a manner that is sustainable and equitable. The court's decision also highlights the importance of inter-generational equity, which requires that the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development. The court's decision is based on the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which only permits diversion of forest land for community benefit projects such as schools and hospitals. The court dismisses the petitioner's claim of violation of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of larger public interest in environmental protection and development. The court's decision is in line with the principles of sustainable development, which emphasize the importance of protecting the environment and promoting development in a manner that is sustainable and equitable.
