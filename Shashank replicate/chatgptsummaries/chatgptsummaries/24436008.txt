The court order in question pertains to an application for bail filed by Smt. Rajshri, who was arrested in 2015 for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code. The applicant's counsel argued that the trial was not progressing and witnesses were not turning up, and therefore, she should be granted bail. However, the court found that the delay in the trial was due to the lawyers' abstaining from work and not the prosecution. The court dismissed the application for bail, stating that the applicant cannot benefit from the delaying tactics adopted by her counsel.

The case of Smt. Rajshri is a classic example of how the Indian legal system can be manipulated by lawyers to delay the trial process. The court's decision to deny bail to the applicant is a welcome move, as it sends a strong message to lawyers that they cannot use delaying tactics to benefit their clients.

The Indian legal system is notorious for its slow pace, and cases can drag on for years before a verdict is reached. This is partly due to the large number of cases pending in courts across the country, but it is also due to the tactics employed by lawyers to delay the trial process. Lawyers often file frivolous applications and seek adjournments to delay the trial, which can be frustrating for both the prosecution and the accused.

In the case of Smt. Rajshri, her counsel argued that the trial was not progressing because witnesses were not turning up. However, the court found that the delay was due to the lawyers' abstaining from work. This is a common tactic employed by lawyers, where they abstain from work to protest against a particular issue. While this is a legitimate form of protest, it should not be used to delay the trial process.

The court's decision to deny bail to Smt. Rajshri is significant, as it sends a strong message to lawyers that they cannot use delaying tactics to benefit their clients. The court stated that the applicant cannot benefit from the delaying tactics adopted by her counsel, which is a clear indication that the court will not tolerate such tactics.

The court's decision is also significant because it upholds the principle of justice. Justice delayed is justice denied, and the court's decision to deny bail to Smt. Rajshri ensures that justice is not delayed any further. The court's decision also ensures that the trial process is not manipulated by lawyers to benefit their clients.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny bail to Smt. Rajshri is a welcome move, as it sends a strong message to lawyers that they cannot use delaying tactics to benefit their clients. The court's decision upholds the principle of justice and ensures that the trial process is not manipulated by lawyers. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a deterrent to lawyers who use delaying tactics to delay the trial process.
