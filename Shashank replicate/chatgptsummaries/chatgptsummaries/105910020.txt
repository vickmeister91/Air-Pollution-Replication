The Gauhati High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by a grinding mill operator against the Gauhati Municipal Corporation (GMC) and others. The petitioner had been directed to either close the mill or shift it to a less congested area due to complaints of noise and air pollution. The petitioner challenged the order, citing a flawed inquiry and arguing that pollution levels were within permissible limits. 

The court, after hearing both parties, directed the petitioner to install a stack emission monitoring system within eight weeks and to monitor ambient air quality and noise levels. The court also stated that if pollution levels exceed permissible limits, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) may direct remedial measures or order closure of the mill. The impugned notice was quashed, and the mill may operate only with valid permission/trade license from the GMC authorities.

The court's decision was based on the principle of sustainable development, which aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection. The court recognized the importance of the grinding mill to the local economy but also acknowledged the need to protect the environment and public health. The court's decision was a compromise between these two competing interests.

The court's decision to require the installation of a stack emission monitoring system and the monitoring of ambient air quality and noise levels is a significant step towards ensuring that the grinding mill operates within permissible limits. The monitoring system will provide real-time data on pollution levels, which will enable the PCB to take remedial measures if necessary. The court's decision also ensures that the grinding mill operator is held accountable for any pollution caused by the mill.

The court's decision is also significant because it recognizes the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making. The petitioner had argued that the inquiry was flawed because the public was not given an opportunity to participate. The court agreed and directed the GMC to conduct a fresh inquiry with public participation. This decision ensures that the public has a say in environmental decision-making, which is essential for sustainable development.

The court's decision is a reminder that economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive. The court recognized the importance of the grinding mill to the local economy but also acknowledged the need to protect the environment and public health. The court's decision is a step towards achieving sustainable development, which is essential for the long-term well-being of society.

In conclusion, the Gauhati High Court's decision in the grinding mill case is a significant step towards achieving sustainable development. The court's decision recognizes the importance of economic growth but also acknowledges the need to protect the environment and public health. The court's decision to require the installation of a stack emission monitoring system and the monitoring of ambient air quality and noise levels is a significant step towards ensuring that the grinding mill operates within permissible limits. The court's decision also ensures that the grinding mill operator is held accountable for any pollution caused by the mill. The court's decision is a reminder that economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive and that public participation is essential for sustainable development.
