The Madras High Court recently heard multiple writ petitions filed by three proprietors challenging the order of the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, dated 08.09.2010, which confirmed the order dated 28.04.2010 passed by the first respondent. The petitioners sought a direction to the first respondent to issue renewal of consent order for the year 2010 - 2011. The court considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel and perused the documents. The court found that the units are bound to get consent order as required under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court dismissed the writ petitions.

The court order pertains to a bone crushing unit in Tamil Nadu that was granted consent to operate by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. However, the consent was not renewed for one of the petitioners, and the other two petitioners were issued a closure order after an inspection found air pollution in the surrounding area. The court directed the first respondent to demand the necessary documents for renewal of consent from the petitioners and pass necessary orders within four weeks of receiving the documents. The court did not grant permission for the unit to operate pending the renewal of consent.
