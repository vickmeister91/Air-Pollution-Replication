Two court orders have been summarized here, both of which involve disputes over the production of documents related to ongoing legal cases. The first case involves a complaint filed by Dr. (Mrs.) Neena V. Patel and her son against Mrs. Jyotsnaben P. Patel and others, alleging that they conspired to prepare a forged will in their favor. The petitioners sought the production of various documents related to the deceased's financial affairs, including bank accounts, lockers, income tax returns, voluntary disclosure of income scheme, wealth tax returns, and shareholding pattern of a company. However, the trial court dismissed the applications, stating that the documents were not necessary and not listed in the complaint. The petitioners challenged the order, but the High Court upheld the trial court's decision, stating that the documents were not essential to the complaint and did not fall under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The second court order pertains to a case involving allegations of forgery related to a will executed in 1991. The court has been asked to exercise its powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents related to the Mohanlal Hargovinddas Group Companies. However, the court has dismissed the petition, stating that it is not satisfied that the documents requested are necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case.

In both cases, the issue at hand is whether certain documents should be produced in order to aid in the resolution of ongoing legal disputes. In the first case, the petitioners argued that the documents they sought were necessary to establish their case that a forged will had been prepared in the respondents' favor. However, the trial court and the High Court both disagreed, stating that the documents were not essential to the complaint and did not fall under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This section allows courts to issue orders for the production of documents that are necessary or desirable for the just decision of a case, but the courts in this case did not find that the documents in question met this standard.

Similarly, in the second case, the court was asked to exercise its powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents related to the Mohanlal Hargovinddas Group Companies. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it was not satisfied that the documents requested were necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case. It is unclear from the summary what specific documents were being sought, or why the court did not find them to be necessary or desirable.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of carefully considering whether certain documents are necessary or desirable for the just decision of a case. While courts have the power to order the production of documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C., they will only do so if they are satisfied that the documents in question meet this standard. In both of these cases, the courts did not find that the documents being sought were necessary or desirable, and therefore declined to order their production.
