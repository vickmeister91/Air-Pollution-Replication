The National Green Tribunal (NGT) received an appeal from Rana Sengupta, a citizen with experience in the steel and iron industries, challenging the Environmental Clearance (EC) granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to M/s. Rashmi Metaliks Limited for the expansion of its existing steel plant. The appellant sought various reliefs, including restraining the respondent from further expansion and quashing the Environmental Clearance. The respondents filed detailed replies, and it was revealed that a proposal for expansion was still under consideration. 

The NGT dismissed the appeal as it had become infructuous due to the passage of time, but the appeal filed assailing the alleged Environmental Clearance granted on 01.06.2012 would be disposed of on its own merits. The NGT observed that the appellant had not challenged the EC granted on 01.06.2012, and therefore, the appeal was not maintainable. However, the NGT noted that the appellant had raised several issues regarding the expansion of the steel plant, which needed to be addressed. 

The NGT directed the MoEF to examine the issues raised by the appellant and take appropriate action. The NGT also directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant did not cause any adverse impact on the environment. The NGT further directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant was in compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations. 

The NGT observed that the expansion of the steel plant would have a significant impact on the environment, and therefore, it was necessary to ensure that all the necessary precautions were taken to protect the environment. The NGT noted that the expansion of the steel plant would result in an increase in the emission of pollutants, which could have adverse effects on the air and water quality in the surrounding areas. 

The NGT also observed that the expansion of the steel plant would result in an increase in the consumption of water, which could have adverse effects on the availability of water in the surrounding areas. The NGT directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant did not result in any depletion of the groundwater resources in the surrounding areas. 

The NGT further directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant did not result in any adverse impact on the flora and fauna in the surrounding areas. The NGT noted that the expansion of the steel plant would result in the loss of forest cover, which could have adverse effects on the biodiversity in the surrounding areas. The NGT directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant did not result in any loss of biodiversity in the surrounding areas. 

In conclusion, the NGT dismissed the appeal as it had become infructuous due to the passage of time, but directed the MoEF to examine the issues raised by the appellant and take appropriate action. The NGT also directed the MoEF to ensure that the expansion of the steel plant did not cause any adverse impact on the environment and was in compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations. The NGT emphasized the need to protect the environment and biodiversity in the surrounding areas and directed the MoEF to take all necessary precautions to achieve this objective.
