The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by trade unions against the National Textile Corporation (NTC) Limited. The unions were aggrieved by the NTC's action of recovering the amount paid as advance on the annual earnings of employees between Rs.30,000/- and Rs.42,000/- under the Bonus Settlements dated 23.01.1997 and 15.10.1998. The NTC had started deducting the said amount paid as advance from the retirement benefits of the workmen who got retired. The unions sought a mandamus forbearing the respondents from deducting any amount from the benefits of the retired employees as well as the existing employees in order to adjust the advance amount paid as per the above settlements.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the writ petitions, stating that the petitioners had an alternative remedy available under Industrial Law to work out the relief sought for in these writ petitions. The court order explains that while courts have the power to entertain writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, they have self-imposed restrictions to decline such petitions when an alternative remedy is available. However, in extraordinary situations, the court may still entertain a writ petition even if an alternative remedy exists.

In this case, the court finds that an efficacious remedy is available under the Industrial Law and there is no extraordinary situation warranting the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226. The court cites various judgments to support its decision and dismisses the writ petitions, but grants the petitioners the liberty to seek remedy under the appropriate Industrial Law.
