The court order in question pertains to four criminal revision applications that have arisen from orders passed by a Magisterial Court in different cases. The central question before the court is whether the order granting discharge to the respondents can be sustained when it is founded on fact dehors the record. The court finds that the foundation of the order is de-hors the record and sets aside the orders discharging the respondents. The matters are remanded to the trial court for proceeding further from the stage of the order impugned in this revision. The revisionists are allowed to raise legally permissible contentions before the trial court.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to first understand the context of the case. The case in question involves four criminal revision applications that have arisen from orders passed by a Magisterial Court in different cases. The respondents in these cases were granted discharge by the Magisterial Court, which means that they were acquitted of the charges against them. However, the revisionists, who are the appellants in this case, have challenged the orders of discharge on the grounds that they were founded on fact dehors the record.

The term "dehors the record" refers to facts that are not part of the official record of the case. In other words, these are facts that were not presented before the court during the trial or were not considered by the court while passing its order. The revisionists have argued that the orders of discharge were based on such facts, which is why they should be set aside.

The court has examined the arguments put forth by the revisionists and has come to the conclusion that the orders of discharge were indeed founded on fact dehors the record. The court has noted that the Magisterial Court had relied on certain documents that were not part of the official record of the case. These documents were not produced before the court during the trial and were not considered by the court while passing its order. Therefore, the foundation of the order was de-hors the record.

Based on this finding, the court has set aside the orders discharging the respondents. The court has also remanded the matters to the trial court for proceeding further from the stage of the order impugned in this revision. This means that the trial court will have to reconsider the case from the point where the orders of discharge were passed. The trial court will have to examine the evidence on record and pass a fresh order based on the evidence presented before it.

The court has also allowed the revisionists to raise legally permissible contentions before the trial court. This means that the revisionists can present new evidence or arguments before the trial court, as long as they are legally permissible. The court has clarified that the revisionists cannot present arguments or evidence that were already presented before the Magisterial Court or that were available to them at the time of the trial.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to four criminal revision applications that have arisen from orders passed by a Magisterial Court in different cases. The court has found that the orders of discharge were founded on fact dehors the record and has set them aside. The matters have been remanded to the trial court for proceeding further from the stage of the order impugned in this revision. The revisionists have been allowed to raise legally permissible contentions before the trial court.
