The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission heard a complaint filed by Paramjit Kaur Gill against M/S Puma Realtors Private Limited. The complainant alleged that the opposite party indulged in unfair trade practices and deficiency in rendering services. The complainant claimed a refund of Rs.37,96,373/- along with interest, compensation for mental agony and physical harassment, and cost of litigation. The opposite party raised objections to the jurisdiction of the commission and the existence of an arbitration clause. The opposite party also denied the allegations and stated that the possession of the plot was subject to timely payment of installments.

The court order pertains to a consumer complaint regarding the purchase of a plot in a residential project. The court examines various aspects of the case, including the payment plan, possession of the plot, and the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court rejects the argument that the complainant, an NRI, is not a consumer and therefore not entitled to protection under the Consumer Protection Act. The court also notes that the existence of an arbitration clause does not preclude the consumer from filing a complaint in a consumer forum.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by a non-resident Indian (NRI) who purchased a residential plot in India and alleged that the developer failed to deliver possession of the plot within the agreed timeframe. The developer raised objections, including that the complainant was an NRI and that the complaint was not maintainable as it related to immovable property. The court rejected these objections, stating that there is no law prohibiting NRIs from purchasing residential property in India and that housing construction falls within the definition of a service under the Consumer Protection Act. The court also held that the clause in the agreement that purported to bar the territorial jurisdiction of the consumer forum was invalid.

The court has set aside the impugned order of the State Commission and remanded the matter to the State Commission to decide the complaint in accordance with the law. The court has also held that the Consumer Foras are bound by the provisions of Section 11 of the Act for determining territorial jurisdiction. The court has further held that an agreement between parties cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the Consumer Foras. In this case, the court has held that the complainant has territorial jurisdiction to file the complaint as a part of the cause of action arose in Chandigarh. The court has also held that the Opposite Party was deficient in rendering service and indulged in unfair trade practice by offering a paper possession to the complainant before completing the development and obtaining necessary approvals. The court has further held that the complainant is entitled to a refund of the entire amount deposited by her.

The court order states that the complainant is entitled to a refund of the deposited amount along with interest and compensation due to the delay in handing over possession of the property. The court cites previous cases where it was held that it is not obligatory for the complainant to accept possession after the stipulated date if the promoter has violated material conditions. The court also orders the Opposite Party to pay compensation for mental agony and physical harassment and deficiency in rendering service. The complainant is entitled to interest on the refunded amount, with different rates for different periods. The court also clarifies that if the complainant has availed a loan facility, the financial institution shall have the first charge on the amount payable.

In summary, the court order pertains to a complaint filed by Paramjit Kaur Gill against M/S Puma Realtors Private Limited regarding the purchase of a plot in a residential project.
