The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Sayari against the Women and Child Development department, challenging her termination from the position of 'Aanganwadi worker' without any show cause notice. The petitioner argued that she belonged to the Schedule Caste and relied on a previous judgment in a similar case. The respondent argued that the petitioner was not present during an inspection and a show cause notice was issued. However, no enquiry was conducted with the participation of the petitioner. The court held that the respondent violated the principles of natural justice and fair play and quoted extensively from previous judgments to explain the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties have an opportunity to be heard and that decisions are made impartially and without malversation. The court notes that these principles are deeply rooted in tradition and conscience and are fundamental to fair adjudication. The court also notes that natural justice is firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and due process. The court applies these principles to a case involving the termination of an Aanganwadi worker without a fair hearing and quashes the termination order.

The court has ruled that an order to terminate the petitioner's job is invalid as no proper inquiry was conducted and the petitioner was not given a chance to participate. The order is quashed and the petitioner is to be reinstated with all benefits including backwages/honorarium. The payment of backwages should be completed within 30 days.
