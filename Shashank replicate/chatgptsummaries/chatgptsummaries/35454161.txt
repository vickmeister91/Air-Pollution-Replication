The National Green Tribunal issued an order on May 23, 2013, in the case of Gurdev Singh vs Punjab Pcb Ors. The order pertains to the Punjab Pollution Control Board's direction to the appellant to stop operating all its outlets and stop discharging any emissions from its industrial premises into the environment while operating in a residential area. The appellant challenged the order on the grounds of violation of natural justice, discrimination, and jurisdiction. The appellant claimed to have established a non-polluting small scale industry and was not required to obtain the consent of the Board. The Board had issued a notification exempting certain industries from obtaining consent.

The court order discusses a case where an industrial unit was ordered to close down due to noise pollution. The appellant argued that they were exempted from obtaining consent from the Board as their industry fell under the exempted category. However, the court rejected this argument and stated that the principles of natural justice were not violated as the appellant was given an opportunity to put forward their case. The court also discussed the seriousness of air pollution and the need for industrial units to obtain consent from the Board.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, which requires industries causing emissions to obtain consent from the State Board. The Act also restricts the establishment or operation of any industrial plant in air pollution control areas without prior consent from the Board. The Board is empowered to lay down emission standards and issue instructions for industrial plants, including automobiles. The court emphasizes that the Board's powers must be exercised in accordance with the Act's provisions and objectives, and cannot be used to perform acts in conflict with the Act. Section 21 of the Act prohibits the establishment or operation of industrial plants without the Board's consent, with no exceptions.

The provisions of the Air Pollution Control Act are not granted to the Board, and cannot be implied through the residuary clause. The court cannot add words to the language of a provision, and omissions by the legislature can only be remedied by a legislative act. The Board is not vested with any legislative power except those specified in the Act, and the power to exempt or exclude must be specifically provided. The principle of exclusion requires clear and unambiguous language and cannot be inferred in the absence of specific language.

The court order states that the power to exempt industries from the provisions of the Act must be specifically provided in the statute or arise from implied power. The Punjab Pollution Control Board's notification exempting certain industries from obtaining consent of the Board under the Act is without authority of the law and is quashed. The appellant's industry causes noise and air pollution and is not covered under the notification. The inspection report shows that the appellant's unit has various machines and a diesel generator set, which is bound to result in pollution. Therefore, the court concludes that the appellant's industry must obtain consent of the Board in terms of Section 21 of the Act.

The court order states that the noise level of the appellant's manufacturing unit is above the permissible limit and is causing air and noise pollution. The appellant's plea of discrimination is dismissed, and the court orders the appellant to either shift their industry from the residential area or bring the pollution parameters within permissible limits within two months. If the appellant fails to comply, the impugned order will become operative, and the appellant must close their unit without any further opportunity. The court declines to interfere in the order and dismisses the application, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to an industrial unit that was ordered to close down due to noise pollution. The appellant challenged the order on the grounds of violation of natural justice, discrimination, and jurisdiction. The court rejected the appellant's argument that they were exempted from obtaining consent from the Board as their industry fell under the exempted category. The court emphasized the seriousness of air pollution and the need for industrial units to obtain consent from the Board. The court also discussed the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, which requires industries causing emissions to obtain consent from the State Board. The court quashed the Punjab Pollution Control Board's notification exempting certain industries from obtaining consent of the Board under the Act. The court ordered the appellant to either shift their industry from the residential area or bring the pollution parameters within permissible limits within two months. If the appellant fails to comply, the impugned order will become operative, and the appellant must close their unit without any further opportunity.
