The Chhattisgarh High Court recently passed a judgment in a criminal misc. petition filed by Chandra Shekhar Jaiswal and Ashwani Jaiswal against the State of Chhattisgarh and Akash Jaiswal. The petitioners challenged an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bilaspur, which entertained an application filed by the complainant under Section 91/93 of CrPC and ordered the police authorities to register an FIR and conduct an investigation. The petitioners argued that the court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering further investigation after taking cognizance of the case. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the magistrate did not act illegally or improperly in ordering further investigation.

The case pertains to a complaint filed by Akash Jaiswal against the petitioners, alleging that they had committed offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complainant alleged that the petitioners had forged documents and cheated him of a sum of Rs. 1.5 crores. The Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bilaspur, entertained the application filed by the complainant under Section 91/93 of CrPC and ordered the police authorities to register an FIR and conduct an investigation.

The petitioners challenged the order of the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bilaspur, on the ground that the court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering further investigation after taking cognizance of the case. The petitioners argued that the court could not have ordered further investigation after taking cognizance of the case, as the power to order further investigation is vested only with the investigating agency and not with the court.

The court, while dismissing the petition, held that the magistrate did not act illegally or improperly in ordering further investigation. The court observed that the power to order further investigation is not an exclusive power of the investigating agency and that the court can also order further investigation if it is necessary for the just decision of the case. The court further observed that the power to order further investigation is a discretionary power and that the court can exercise this power if it is satisfied that further investigation is necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also observed that the power to order further investigation is not an unlimited power and that the court can exercise this power only in exceptional cases where the investigating agency has failed to investigate the case properly or where the investigation conducted by the investigating agency is incomplete. The court held that in the present case, the magistrate had ordered further investigation after considering the material on record and after being satisfied that further investigation was necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also observed that the petitioners had not challenged the order of the magistrate on the ground of lack of jurisdiction at the appropriate stage and that they cannot challenge the same at this stage. The court held that the petitioners had participated in the investigation and had not raised any objection to the jurisdiction of the magistrate at that stage. The court further held that the petitioners cannot be allowed to challenge the jurisdiction of the magistrate at this stage, as it would amount to an abuse of the process of the court.

In conclusion, the Chhattisgarh High Court dismissed the criminal misc. petition filed by Chandra Shekhar Jaiswal and Ashwani Jaiswal against the State of Chhattisgarh and Akash Jaiswal. The court held that the magistrate did not act illegally or improperly in ordering further investigation and that the petitioners cannot challenge the jurisdiction of the magistrate at this stage. The court observed that the power to order further investigation is a discretionary power and that the court can exercise this power if it is satisfied that further investigation is necessary for the just decision of the case.
