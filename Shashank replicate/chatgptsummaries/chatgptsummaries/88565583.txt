The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the pollution and contamination of water in various canals and distributories in Sri Ganganagar district, Rajasthan. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Veena Rani against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court also noted that one of the WP No. 718/2009, which concerns the main Ganga nahar Canal, had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The second court order concerns the pollution and contamination of water in the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal. The State was directed to come up with short and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court requested compliance reports and action plans from the State and local authorities. The court also imposed a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed citizens to be made aware of this penalty. The court ordered the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date and warned that a cost would be imposed if the State failed to submit the long and short-term plans and action reports.

The third court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals passing through municipal areas in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The state government was directed to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund. The compliance report filed by the state did not disclose the number of encroachers who obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the state to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, failing which appropriate action would be taken.

The fourth court order directs the state to comply with the directions of the Tribunal regarding the removal of structures causing contamination of canal water and to file a compliance report. The Chief Engineer is directed to provide complete details of the action taken by the government. The District Collector is ordered to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to environment protection. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The fifth court order discusses the power of a superior court to issue a writ of certiorari to correct errors made by a lower court or tribunal, even if an appeal to another court was available. The court may exercise this power if the lower court or tribunal lacked adequate legal training or made a glaring error. However, the court may still require a party to exhaust all other remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction. In this specific case, the court dismissed a writ petition and allowed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone delay and is expected to consider the delay caused by the pending writ petition sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until December 31, 2016.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that water bodies are not contaminated or polluted. The State and local authorities have a responsibility to take measures to prevent pollution and remove encroachments on water bodies. The court has imposed penalties and ordered compliance reports to ensure that these measures are taken seriously. The National Green Tribunal has been given jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to environment protection, and parties are encouraged to exhaust all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.
