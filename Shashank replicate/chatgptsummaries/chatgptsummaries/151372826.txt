The court order in question pertains to a case where the appellant had applied for an industrial plot under a relocation scheme for industries sponsored by the government. The appellant's application was rejected on the grounds that the scheme only applied to units located in non-confirming/residential areas and not in designated commercial areas. The appellant filed a suit, which was decreed in his favor by the trial court, but the appellate court set aside the judgment, stating that the scheme did not apply to units located in local commercial areas. The court concluded that the order of the trial court was not sustainable and there appeared to be material irregularity in reading the words 'local commercial area' into the words 'non-confirming/residential area.'

The court order states that the trial court's decision to include the words "local commercial area" in the category of "non-confirming area" was not sustainable and there was a material irregularity in doing so. The appellate court found that the government's scheme did not apply to the appellant's unit as it was not being run in a non-confirming area/residential area. The court also stated that the appellant had not provided any evidence of other units in local commercial areas being given plots under the relocation scheme. The court dismissed the appeal as no substantial question of law arose.

To understand the court order, it is important to understand the background of the case. The appellant had applied for an industrial plot under a relocation scheme for industries sponsored by the government.

The appellant's application was rejected on the grounds that the scheme only applied to units located in non-confirming/residential areas and not in designated commercial areas. The appellant filed a suit, which was decreed in his favor by the trial court. However, the appellate court set aside the judgment, stating that the scheme did not apply to units located in local commercial areas.
