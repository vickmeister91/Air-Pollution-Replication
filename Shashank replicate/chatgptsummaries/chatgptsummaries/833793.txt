The Hyderabad High Court recently issued a court order in a case where the representatives of a deceased plaintiff filed a suit to claim their share in the estate of the deceased's sister, who was married to the respondent. The trial court had rejected the application to sue in forma pauperis, which is a legal term that refers to a person who is too poor to pay the court fees required to file a lawsuit. The court had ordered the plaintiff to pay the necessary court fee, but the plaintiff failed to do so within the allowed period.

As a result, a revision petition was filed against the order in the Hyderabad High Court. The court held that the rejection of the prayer to sue in forma pauperis and payment of court-fees on it would justify the document being treated as a plaint, which is a formal written statement submitted to a court by a plaintiff, and the suit would be instituted on the day the application was filed in court.

The court allowed the appeal as a revision petition and set aside the finding of the trial court. The court held that the suit for the dower debt was within limitation, which means that it was filed within the time period allowed by law. The court remanded the case to the trial court to proceed further.

The case involved a dispute over the estate of the deceased's sister, who was married to the respondent. The representatives of the deceased plaintiff filed a suit to claim their share in the estate, but the trial court rejected their application to sue in forma pauperis. This meant that they were required to pay the necessary court fee, but they failed to do so within the allowed period.

The Hyderabad High Court's decision to allow the appeal as a revision petition and set aside the finding of the trial court was based on the fact that the rejection of the prayer to sue in forma pauperis and payment of court-fees on it would justify the document being treated as a plaint. This meant that the suit would be instituted on the day the application was filed in court.

The court also held that the suit for the dower debt was within limitation, which meant that it was filed within the time period allowed by law. This was an important finding because it meant that the case could proceed further in the trial court.

Overall, the Hyderabad High Court's court order in this case was significant because it allowed the appeal as a revision petition and set aside the finding of the trial court. The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts and the law, and it was an important step in resolving the dispute over the estate of the deceased's sister.
