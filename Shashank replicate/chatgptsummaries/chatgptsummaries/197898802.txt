The court order pertains to a case of eviction of a tenant under Section 14(1)(a) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. The petitioner, who is the landlord, had let out two shops to the respondent for a monthly rent of Rs. 120/- each, which was subsequently raised to Rs. 620/- per month for each shop. The petitioner claimed that the respondent was a habitual defaulter in payment of rent and had not paid rent for the last three years. The court found that the petitioner had established the landlord-tenant relationship with the respondent and was entitled to receive rent as the legal heir of the owner of the shops in question. The court also noted that the respondent had failed to establish an alternate landlord. The court ordered the eviction of the respondent and directed him to pay the arrears of rent.

The court order states that the petitioner is authorized to collect rent from the respondent, and that the defense presented by the respondent is contradictory and unreliable. The court finds that the respondent is a tenant of the petitioner and owes arrears of rent for a period of three years. The court determines the rate of rent payable by the respondent to be Rs. 120/- per month and orders the respondent to pay the arrears of rent along with interest. The respondent is given until December 30, 2013, to make the payment.

Overall, both court orders deal with cases of non-payment of rent by tenants. In the first case, the court ordered the eviction of the tenant and directed him to pay the arrears of rent. In the second case, the court ordered the tenant to pay the arrears of rent along with interest. In both cases, the court found that the landlord-tenant relationship existed and that the tenants owed rent to the landlords. The court also noted that the tenants had failed to establish an alternate landlord. 

It is important for tenants to pay their rent on time and for landlords to establish the landlord-tenant relationship with their tenants. Failure to do so can result in legal action and eviction. It is also important for tenants to establish an alternate landlord in case of disputes with their current landlord.
