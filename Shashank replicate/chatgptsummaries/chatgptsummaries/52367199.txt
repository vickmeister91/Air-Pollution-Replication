The court order pertains to an appeal filed against the grant of an Environmental Clearance (EC) for the development of a greenfield international airport at Mopa in Goa. The court discusses the process of obtaining the clearance, including the stages of scoping, public consultation, and appraisal, and the requirements for environmental protection. The court also discusses the need for additional safeguards for environmental protection and the importance of environmental rule of law. The court issues directions for the project proponent to comply with various guidelines and regulations related to environmental protection.

The grant of the EC was challenged by the Federation of Rainbow Warriors and Hanuman Laxman Aroskar before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT issued an ad-interim order restraining the cutting or felling of trees in the area designated as the site of the proposed airport. The order was modified to allow the cutting and felling of trees only after prior permission was granted by the NGT. The State of Goa filed a Miscellaneous Application seeking permission for the felling of trees, which was granted by the NGT with additional conditions to safeguard the environment. The appellants challenged the judgment of the NGT, alleging material concealments by the project proponent in failing to disclose the number of trees required to be felled and the existence of Ecologically Sensitive Zones in the State of Maharashtra. The court admitted the appeals for hearing and final disposal.

The court order pertains to the issuance of a notification under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act 1927 and the Forest Conservation Act 1980. The court found that the EIA report for a proposed airport project was deficient in several aspects, including the failure to mention forests in the State of Maharashtra, the absence of baseline data for environmental parameters in Maharashtra, and the failure to notice wildlife in the surrounding forests. The court also found that the public consultation and appraisal stages under the 2006 notification were crucial to the assessment process and that the EAC had failed to furnish reasons for recommending the grant of an EC. The order also discusses the lack of sampling points in Maharashtra and the presence of forest areas in both the States of Goa and Maharashtra within a radius of 10 kilometres.

The court order discusses the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the proposed international airport at Mopa in Goa. The court considers various submissions made by the parties involved, including the choice of sampling locations, the avi-faunal study, and the environmentally sensitive zones (ESZs). The court also discusses the felling of trees and the progress made by the concessionaire. The court emphasizes the importance of the EIA process in balancing environmental and developmental concerns and protecting the environment.

The court order discusses the 1994 and 2006 notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in India, which impose restrictions and prohibitions on new projects or the expansion of existing projects unless an Environmental Clearance (EC) is granted. The 2006 notification categorizes projects into Category A and B, with the MoEFCC regulating Category A projects and the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority regulating Category B projects. The process to obtain an EC involves screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal. The court order explains the differences between the 1994 and 2006 notifications and the objective of the 2006 notification to protect the environment.

The court order outlines the detailed procedure for obtaining an Environmental Clearance (EC) for projects or activities that may have an impact on the environment. The process involves public consultation, appraisal by expert committees, and approval by regulatory authorities. The applicant must provide detailed information in Form 1/Form 1A, which is used to prepare comprehensive Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. The EIA report must address all possible environmental concerns, and the applicant must address all material concerns expressed during the public consultation process. The regulatory authority must communicate any inadequacy to the expert committees, who make recommendations for approval or rejection of the application. The process is designed to balance development with environmental protection and ensure sustainable development.

The court order requires that any application for environmental clearance must be accompanied by a complete and accurate Form 1, which provides information on the proposed project's potential impacts. The Guidance manual for airports provides specific instructions for collecting baseline data on various environmental parameters, including land, water, air, noise, biological, socio-economic, and solid waste. The manual emphasizes the importance of collecting accurate data to evaluate the predicted impact on environmental attributes and to prepare an EMP that outlines measures for improving environmental quality. The manual also acknowledges that airport operations may alter ecosystems, threaten endangered species, and disturb wildlife movement and breeding patterns.

The court order pertains to an airport development project and the need to assess its impact on the environment. The order requires the collection of baseline data on various ecological systems, characterization of environmental components, and understanding the impact of airport development on vegetation. The order also mandates the collection of data on sensitive habitats and endangered species in the project area. The court also discusses the importance of disclosing all aspects of the environment in the study area, including forests, and the duty of the project proponent to make a full and complete disclosure. The court emphasizes that the term "forests" should be understood in its ordinary and natural connotation and not limited to statutory definitions. The court also notes that the EIA report does consider the prevalence of forested areas in the study area.
