The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by vehicle owners who were denied comprehensive insurance policies by the New Indian Assurance Company Ltd. The Insurance Company had refused to issue comprehensive insurance policies for vehicles that were more than 10 years old. The petitioners argued that this refusal was in violation of Section 147(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. However, the court ruled that the Insurance Company was not legally bound to issue comprehensive insurance policies and that any insurance covering risks other than third party risks would be governed by the terms and conditions of the contract of insurance.

The court order states that insurance cover exceeding Rs. 1,50,000 should not be given without referral to the Regional Office for consideration and approval. The insurance company must follow underwriting guidelines before issuing comprehensive liability coverage. The company issued a circular in 1997 specifying the age of vehicles eligible for comprehensive policy. If the company refuses coverage for valid reasons, such as old vehicles not meeting necessary conditions, no mandamus can be issued to force coverage. The court dismissed the writ applications.
