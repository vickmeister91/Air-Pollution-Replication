In a recent court order, the issue of whether compensation paid to legal heirs after the death of a person is liable to estate duty was addressed. The case in question involved the legal heirs of a deceased person who were given Rs. 42,000 as compensation by the Indian Airlines Corporation after he died in a plane crash. The Assistant Controller, Estate Duty, subjected the amount to estate duty, but the Zonal Appellate Controller and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal held that the compensation was not liable to estate duty as it did not form part of the estate of the deceased.

The court agreed with the Tribunal's decision, stating that the compensation did not exist during the lifetime of the deceased and, therefore, could not pass on his death. The court also rejected the argument that the compensation could be considered part of the deceased's estate as it was paid to his heirs after his death. The court held that compensation money or damages payable in respect of the death of the deceased under certain acts are not part of "the estate passing on his death."

The court further rejected the argument that the deceased provided an interest which fructified on his death by purchasing an air ticket. The court concluded that the amount in question is not subject to estate duty and ruled in favor of the assessee.

This court order has significant implications for the taxation of compensation paid to legal heirs after the death of a person. It clarifies that such compensation is not liable to estate duty as it does not form part of the estate of the deceased. This is an important ruling as it provides clarity on the tax treatment of compensation paid to legal heirs in cases of death.

The court's decision is based on the principle that only property that exists at the time of the deceased's death can be subject to estate duty. Compensation paid to legal heirs after the death of a person does not exist at the time of the deceased's death and, therefore, cannot be subject to estate duty.

The court's rejection of the argument that the deceased provided an interest which fructified on his death by purchasing an air ticket is also significant. This argument suggests that the deceased's purchase of an air ticket created an interest that passed on his death and was subject to estate duty. The court's rejection of this argument clarifies that compensation paid to legal heirs after the death of a person is not subject to estate duty, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the deceased's death.

Overall, this court order provides clarity on the tax treatment of compensation paid to legal heirs after the death of a person. It clarifies that such compensation is not liable to estate duty as it does not form part of the estate of the deceased. This is an important ruling that will have significant implications for the taxation of compensation paid to legal heirs in cases of death.
