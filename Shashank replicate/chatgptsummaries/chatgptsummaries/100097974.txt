The High Court of Karnataka issued a court order on August 12, 2011, in a case between Shekar Dattatri and Anita Arekal. The petitioners were seeking to quash the FIR lodged against them, and the court issued an order regarding the same. However, the details of the order were not provided in the given text.

In another case, the court order pertained to a petition to quash an FIR lodged against the petitioners by the second respondent. The first petitioner was a renowned wildlife documentary filmmaker and founder-trustee of an environmental education non-profit organization. The second petitioner was an honorary wildlife warden, and the third petitioner was a coffee planter actively involved in wildlife conservation activities. The case involved the Kudremukh National Park, a biodiversity hotspot and the largest wildlife reserve of tropical wet evergreen forests in the Western Ghats. The petitioners had been closely involved in its conservation over the years, including executing conservation initiatives in collaboration with the forest department. The case also involved the Community Leadership for Tiger Conservation project and its activities, which were carried out with full knowledge of local officials and in association with them.

The court order recognized the role of NGOs in protecting forests and wildlife and discussed the power of individuals to file complaints in court after giving notice to the government. The court recommended an inquiry into the legality of criminal proceedings against certain individuals and directed appropriate action against a Deputy Conservator of Forests for violating orders and making derogatory comments. The court found that the allegations against the petitioners had no substance and that there was a clash of egos between the parties involved. The court also noted that the proceedings may be motivated by vindictiveness and that the process of law was being abused.

The court order also discussed the power of quashing a criminal proceeding and provided illustrations of cases where this power could be exercised, such as when the allegations did not constitute an offense or were absurd and improbable. The court cautioned that this power should be used sparingly and not arbitrarily. The present case involved petitioners who were actively involved in protecting the forest and had committed no offense under the Act. The allegations made against them were absurd and improbable, and there was no evidence to support them. Therefore, the court quashed the criminal proceedings against them.

In another case, poor families had encroached on forest land, and the petitioners, who were associated with various conservation advocacy groups, had been fighting for wildlife conservation in Karnataka. They had presented evidence before the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the ecological damage caused by iron ore mining in Kudremukh National Park. The court had ordered the winding up of mining activities by 2005, and the petitioners had been following up with the forest department to ensure that the affected area was notified as part of the national park. The FIR filed against the petitioners for entering the Kerekatte Wildlife Sanctuary without permission was found to be incorrect, and the court recognized the role of NGOs in protecting forests and wildlife.

The court order stated that it was in the interest of protecting the natural wealth found in a national park to take action to prevent illegal mining and logging. The order called for cooperation and assistance from the petitioners to ensure that their activities did not harm the park. The petitioners were also ordered to cease any illegal activities and to allow access to the park for officials to monitor the situation.

In yet another case, the court order allowed a writ petition and quashed a complaint and proceedings before a learned magistrate. The parties involved were to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed various cases related to wildlife conservation in Karnataka. The court recognized the role of NGOs and public-spirited persons in protecting the environment and cautioned against the abuse of the process of law. The court also discussed the power of quashing a criminal proceeding and provided illustrations of cases where this power could be exercised. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the natural wealth found in a national park and called for cooperation and assistance from the petitioners to ensure that their activities did not harm the park. Finally, the court allowed a writ petition and quashed a complaint and proceedings before a learned magistrate.
