The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to various lawsuits involving property disputes and unauthorized construction. In the first court order, Smt. Kanta filed a lawsuit against Smt. Meena Sharma and others for running an illegal factory without a license and raising unauthorized construction on their property. The plaintiffs sought a permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendants. The defendants argued that the suit was barred under Section 10 CPC and that the plaintiffs were concealing material facts. The court reserved judgment on the case and ultimately granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent and mandatory injunction.

In the second court order, Kanta and Meena Sharma were involved in a lawsuit over the installation of an antenna on a property. The court noted that the antenna had already been installed and that a similar suit was previously declined by two other courts. The defendants denied any wrongdoing and stated that the suit was not properly valued for court fee and jurisdiction. The court also noted that there were multiple litigations pending between the parties. The order listed preliminary objections raised by various defendants, and the court framed several issues to be addressed in the case.

The third court order discussed the examination of witnesses in a case regarding the installation of a cellular tower on a property without proper permission. The court considered several issues, including whether the suit was maintainable, whether it was barred under certain acts, and whether the plaintiff was entitled to relief. The court also examined the testimony of witnesses, including the plaintiff and defendants, regarding the installation of the tower and any unauthorized construction on the property. However, the court's findings on each issue were not provided in the summary.

In the fourth court order, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendants for unauthorized construction and installation of a cellular tower. The court decided in favor of the plaintiff and granted a permanent injunction against the defendants, restraining them from raising any illegal and unauthorized construction for fixing cellular towers and generators on the suit property. The court also ordered the defendants to demolish and remove the cellular tower fixed by them from the suit property. The court dismissed objections raised by the defendants related to the maintainability of the suit and non-compliance with legal provisions.

Finally, the fifth court order decreed in favor of the plaintiff in a case against the defendants. The plaintiff was entitled to a permanent injunction against the defendants, preventing them from constructing cellular towers and generators on the plaintiff's property. The defendants were also directed to demolish and remove a cellular tower that had already been constructed on the property. The court ordered the preparation of a decree sheet, and the file would be consigned to the record room after compliance.

In summary, these court orders all involve disputes over property and unauthorized construction. The courts have granted permanent injunctions against the defendants, restraining them from raising any illegal and unauthorized construction for fixing cellular towers and generators on the suit property. The courts have also ordered the defendants to demolish and remove any unauthorized construction that has already been erected on the property. The courts have dismissed objections raised by the defendants related to the maintainability of the suit and non-compliance with legal provisions.
