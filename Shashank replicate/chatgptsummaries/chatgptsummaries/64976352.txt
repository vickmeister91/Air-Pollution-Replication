The court has granted anticipatory bail to Hiralal Sahu, who was facing arrest in connection with a complaint case under various sections of the Indian Forest Act, Forest Protection Act, and Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner claimed to be falsely implicated and a petty contractor under IRCON INTERNATIONAL LIMITED. The court imposed a cost of Rs. 5,000/- on the petitioner to be deposited before the President/Secretary, Advocates' Clerk Association, Ranchi within four weeks.

The petitioner was directed to surrender in the court below within two weeks from the date of receiving the receipts of deposition and would be granted bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 15,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, Gumla, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Hiralal Sahu is significant as it provides him with temporary relief from arrest. The petitioner had claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case and was a petty contractor under IRCON INTERNATIONAL LIMITED. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail indicates that it found merit in the petitioner's claim and believed that he was not a flight risk.

The court's decision to impose a cost of Rs. 5,000/- on the petitioner is also significant as it serves as a deterrent against frivolous petitions. The court has directed the petitioner to deposit the cost before the President/Secretary, Advocates' Clerk Association, Ranchi within four weeks. This cost is not a fine but rather a sum of money that the petitioner is required to pay as a consequence of filing a frivolous petition.

The court has also directed the petitioner to surrender in the court below within two weeks from the date of receiving the receipts of deposition. This means that the petitioner must surrender himself to the authorities within two weeks of depositing the cost. Failure to do so would result in the cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted by the court.

The court has further directed that the petitioner would be granted bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 15,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, Gumla, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C. This means that the petitioner must provide a bail bond of Rs. 15,000/- along with two sureties of the same amount each. The sureties must satisfy the Judicial Magistrate, Gumla, that they are financially capable of fulfilling their obligations in case the petitioner fails to appear before the court.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Hiralal Sahu is significant as it provides him with temporary relief from arrest. The court's decision to impose a cost of Rs. 5,000/- on the petitioner serves as a deterrent against frivolous petitions. The court's direction to surrender within two weeks and furnish a bail bond with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, Gumla, ensures that the petitioner appears before the court and does not abscond.
