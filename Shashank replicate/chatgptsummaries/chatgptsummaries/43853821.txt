The Kerala High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by the Diamond Action Council and M/S Diamond Aggregates. The Diamond Action Council alleged that the quarrying and stone crushing operations of M/S Diamond Aggregates were causing harm to nature and human lives, and requested that the Maneed Grama Panchayat take action to stop these activities. M/S Diamond Aggregates challenged a stop memo issued by the Maneed Grama Panchayat, claiming it was issued without competence and jurisdiction. The court heard both cases together and heard arguments from all parties involved.

The court order pertains to a case where the Action Council alleges that M/s. Diamond Aggregates is operating their quarry and stone crusher illegally, causing nuisance and hardships to the petitioners and other residents. M/s. Diamond Aggregates asserts that they have all the necessary consents, permissions, and licenses issued by the competent authorities. The court finds that the allegations and counter-allegations are essentially in the realm of factual disputations and that the Action Council or any other person who has any legitimate grievance against M/s. Diamond Aggregates must approach the competent authorities in terms of the law, rather than seeking a blanket order. The court also notes that M/s. Diamond Aggregates are in possession of all licenses and consents required in law, and it would not be possible for the court to intervene in their activities as long as it is done legally.

The court order sets aside a stop memo issued by the Panchayat against M/s. Diamond Aggregates for illegal mining. The court allows the Action Council and other petitioners to approach the competent authority with any complaint they may have, but also leaves liberty to the petitioners to challenge any of the consents, licenses, and permissions obtained by M/s. Diamond Aggregates. The court also clarifies that none of its observations in the judgment will trammel them in doing so. The court also quashes the consequential Ext.P10 order in W.P.(C) No.26250/2019. The appendix lists the exhibits presented by both the petitioners and the respondents.

The court order pertains to a case with the WP(C) number 22056/2018 in the High Court of Kerala.
