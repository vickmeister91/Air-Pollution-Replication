The case of Bhagwandas, who filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., involved the release of his vehicle Tractor No.RJ11-RA-8172 along with Trolley. The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.3, Badi, District Dholpur, had refused to release the vehicle, which was the case property of FIR No.33/2019. The petitioner's counsel argued that no confiscation proceedings were pending against the vehicle, and therefore, it should be released. 

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. This decision was a significant victory for Bhagwandas, who had been fighting for the release of his vehicle for some time.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there were no confiscation proceedings pending against the vehicle, and it was the case property of FIR No.33/2019. The court also took into account the arguments put forward by the petitioner's counsel, who argued that the vehicle should be released as it was not involved in any criminal activity. The court agreed with these arguments and directed the trial court to release the vehicle.

The conditions imposed by the court were designed to ensure that the vehicle was not used for any illegal activities. The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions it deemed fit, which would ensure that the vehicle was not used for any criminal activity. The petitioner and sureties were required to furnish a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds, which would ensure that they were responsible for the vehicle's safekeeping.
