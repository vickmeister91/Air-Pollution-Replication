The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently allowed an application filed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board under Section 378 (4) of the Cr.P.C. to appeal against the acquittal of M/S. Rairu Distillery Ltd. under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence and material available on record and had committed errors of law. The matter was directed to be registered as a criminal appeal.

The case pertains to the pollution caused by M/S. Rairu Distillery Ltd. in the Rairu village of Gwalior district in Madhya Pradesh. The company was accused of discharging untreated effluent into the nearby water bodies, which resulted in the pollution of the groundwater and the soil. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the company under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

During the trial, the prosecution had produced several witnesses and documents to prove its case. However, the trial court had acquitted the company on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court had also observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the effluent discharged by the company had caused pollution in the area.

The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had challenged the acquittal of the company in the High Court. The Board had contended that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence and material available on record and had committed errors of law. The Board had also argued that the trial court had ignored the fact that the company had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and had caused pollution in the area.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, allowed the application filed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board and directed that the matter be registered as a criminal appeal. The court observed that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence and material available on record and had committed errors of law. The court also noted that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court further observed that the trial court had ignored the fact that the company had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and had caused pollution in the area. The court held that the acquittal of the company was not sustainable in law and directed that the matter be re-examined by the appellate court.

The decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of strict enforcement of environmental laws in the country. The court has sent a strong message to the polluters that they cannot escape the consequences of their actions and that they will be held accountable for the damage caused by them. The decision is also a reminder to the authorities that they need to be vigilant in enforcing the environmental laws and taking action against the violators.

In conclusion, the decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court to allow the appeal filed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board against the acquittal of M/S. Rairu Distillery Ltd. under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a welcome step towards ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment for the people. The decision is a reminder to the polluters that they cannot escape the consequences of their actions and that they will be held accountable for the damage caused by them.
