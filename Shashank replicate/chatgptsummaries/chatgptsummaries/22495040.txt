The court order pertains to a criminal revision filed by H.C. Chawla and Manish Chawla against an order passed by the trial court dismissing their application under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The revisionists had sought to recall a witness for further cross-examination on the ground that they had recently come into possession of certain invoices and delivery challans that were not available to them at the time of the earlier cross-examination. The court found no illegality in the trial court's order and noted that the accused had delayed the proceedings by avoiding appearance for a long time. The court dismissed the revision petition.

The court order states that the accused must face trial and that their plea of recently unearthed invoices cannot be believed as they had knowledge of them and had them in their possession. The court also notes that the issue of Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act is not significant and that electronic evidence will be considered as per law. The court dismisses the revision petition and directs the parties to appear before the trial court for further proceedings. The order cannot be assailed in criminal revision as it is interlocutory in nature. The court also notes that the accused have adopted dilatory tactics to derail the proceedings and delay the case. The present criminal revision petition is consigned to the record room.
