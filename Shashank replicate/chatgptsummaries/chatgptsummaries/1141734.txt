The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by an auction-purchaser against a judgment-debtor who sought to set aside a sale on the grounds that no notice was served on him as required by Order XXI, Rule 22, and that processes had been fraudulently suppressed. The trial court rejected the application, but the district court held that the sale was without jurisdiction as no notice had been served. The auction-purchaser appealed, arguing that the want of service of notice only rendered the sale voidable, not void. However, the court held that the omission to serve a notice under Order XXI, Rule 22 deprived the court of its jurisdiction to hold a sale, and the sale held without such notice was void and a nullity. The appeal was dismissed with costs.

The case revolves around the sale of a property that was conducted without the required notice being served to the judgment-debtor.

The trial court rejected the application, but the district court held that the sale was without jurisdiction as no notice had been served.

The court, however, held that the omission to serve a notice under Order XXI, Rule 22 deprived the court of its jurisdiction to hold a sale, and the sale held without such notice was void and a nullity. The court's decision was based on the fact that the notice requirement was not a mere procedural formality but was essential to the jurisdiction of the court to hold a sale.
