The court noted that the charges against him were serious in nature and that there was a possibility of him tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses if he was granted bail.

Instead, the court allowed him to surrender before the Investigating Officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material. The court directed the Investigating Officer to interrogate Alexander and recover any incriminating material that may be in his possession. The court also directed Alexander to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses in any way.

The court further directed that Alexander's application for regular bail be considered and disposed of by the Magistrate preferably on the same day it is filed. The court noted that Alexander had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that his application for regular bail should be considered expeditiously.
