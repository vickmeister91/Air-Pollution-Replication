The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Rajmal under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner was arrested on May 27, 2016, by the Police Station Dy. Forest Ranger, District Gwalior (M.P.) in connection with Crime No. 4938/07, registered in relation to the offence punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution case is that 200 scales of Pengolin and 10 gms of Mongoose hairs have been recovered from the petitioner for which the maximum punishment of 7 years is prescribed.

The court rejected the bail application considering the gravity of the offence. However, the court directed that in offences involving punishment up to seven years imprisonment, the police may resort to the extreme step of arrest only when the same is necessary and the applicant does not cooperate in the investigation. The court also enumerated guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273, which should be made applicable universally to all cases involving offences prescribing punishment up to 7 years of imprisonment.

The court's decision to reject the bail application was based on the gravity of the offence. The petitioner was arrested in connection with a wildlife protection case, and the prosecution had recovered 200 scales of Pengolin and 10 gms of Mongoose hairs from him. The maximum punishment for this offence is 7 years, and the court deemed it necessary to deny bail to the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court rejected Rajmal's bail application considering the gravity of the offence. However, it also directed that in cases where the punishment is up to 7 years of imprisonment, the police should only resort to the extreme step of arrest when it is necessary and the applicant does not cooperate in the investigation.
