The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, provides for the regulation of rents and the recovery of possession of premises in Delhi. Section 14(1)(e) of the Act allows a landlord to seek eviction of a tenant if the premises are required by the landlord for their own use or for the use of a dependent family member and they have no other suitable accommodation. In a recent court order, the petitioner, Sh. Anita Devi Tulsiyan, sought possession of a commercial property in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, which was previously let out to the respondents. The petitioner claimed that she required the property for the business of her son, who was jobless and had no other reasonable commercial accommodation.

The respondents contested the application, claiming that there was no relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and that the petitioner had sufficient alternate accommodation available. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and ultimately granted the petitioner's application for eviction. The court found that the petitioner was the owner and landlord of the premises and that she had established a bona fide requirement for the property for the business of her son. The respondent failed to provide evidence of suitable alternative accommodation, and therefore, the court found in favor of the petitioner.

The court order stated that no court or controller can make an order for the recovery of possession of any premises in favor of the landlord against a tenant, except on certain grounds, such as if the premises are required by the landlord for themselves or a dependent family member and they have no other suitable accommodation. The court must determine whether the petitioner is the owner of the premises, whether the premises are required bona fide by the petitioner, and whether the petitioner has no other suitable accommodation. The petitioner had provided evidence of ownership and the need for the premises, while the respondent had failed to provide evidence of suitable alternative accommodation. Therefore, the court found in favor of the petitioner.

The court order allowed the petitioner to recover possession of the property for her son's needs, as she had established a bona fide requirement and had no other alternative accommodation. The respondent's defense that the petition was not instituted against the right person was not sustained, and the petitioner was the owner and landlord of the premises. The order for recovery of possession shall not be executed before the expiration of six months from the date of the order. There shall be no order as to costs.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of establishing a bona fide requirement for the recovery of possession of premises under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The petitioner in this case was able to provide evidence of ownership and the need for the premises, while the respondent failed to provide evidence of suitable alternative accommodation. The court found in favor of the petitioner and allowed her to recover possession of the property for her son's needs. The order for recovery of possession shall not be executed before the expiration of six months from the date of the order, and there shall be no order as to costs.
