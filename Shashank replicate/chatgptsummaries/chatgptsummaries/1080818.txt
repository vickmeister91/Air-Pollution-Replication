The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against a company and its directors for discharging trade effluent without treatment. The company had applied for consent under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which was rejected. The premises of the factory were inspected, and a sample of the trade effluent was taken. However, the prosecution failed to comply with the provisions of Sections 21(5) and 22(2) of the Act, and the requirements of Indian Standard Method of Sampling. The prosecution also did not comply with the requirements of the Cr.P.C. As a result, the accused were discharged as the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against them.

The court discussed the relevant provisions of Sections 21, 22, and 23 of the Act and held that the interpretation and reasoning adopted by the trial court were erroneous. The court set aside the judgment and order of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case No. 2487 of 1988. The court observed that the prosecution had failed to comply with the provisions of Sections 21(5) and 22(2) of the Act, which require that the sample of the trade effluent be taken in the presence of the accused or their representatives. The court also noted that the prosecution had not followed the Indian Standard Method of Sampling, which is mandatory under the Act.

The court further observed that the prosecution had not complied with the requirements of the Cr.P.C. The court held that the prosecution had not followed the procedure laid down in Section 207 of the Cr.P.C., which requires that the accused be supplied with copies of the documents and statements recorded during the investigation. The court also noted that the prosecution had not complied with the provisions of Section 173(5) of the Cr.P.C., which requires that the accused be given an opportunity to inspect the documents and statements recorded during the investigation.

The court then discussed the relevant provisions of Sections 21, 22, and 23 of the Act. The court held that the interpretation and reasoning adopted by the trial court were erroneous. The court observed that Section 21(5) of the Act requires that the sample of the trade effluent be taken in the presence of the accused or their representatives. The court held that this provision is mandatory and cannot be waived. The court also noted that Section 22(2) of the Act requires that the analysis report of the sample be sent to the accused or their representatives. The court held that sending the analysis report to the same address as mentioned in the notice under Sub-section (3)(a) of Section 21 would be sufficient compliance of the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 22.

The court further clarified that the provisions of Section 23 apply to search and seizure under that section only and not to the taking of samples under Section 21. The court held that the prosecution had not complied with the provisions of Section 23 of the Act, which requires that the search and seizure be conducted in the presence of two or more independent witnesses.

In light of the above observations, the court set aside the judgment and order of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad in Criminal Case No. 2487 of 1988. The court allowed the revision application and directed the trial court to frame charges and proceed with the trial in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Cr.P.C. The court has clarified the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act and has emphasized the mandatory nature of certain provisions. The court has also emphasized the need for compliance with the procedural requirements of the Cr.P.C. The court's order serves as a reminder to all concerned parties to ensure strict compliance with the law.
