On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in response to multiple writ petitions filed by individuals against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The petitions were related to the eviction of individuals from government land they were occupying without authorization. While the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land. 

The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government of Himachal Pradesh in 2017, which indicated that the state government was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court acknowledged that some of the encroachers were landless and homeless, while others were small and marginalized landowners. 

The court refrained from expressing any views on the issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. Instead, the court left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. 

The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and the authorities were directed to take a holistic view of the matter. The court clarified that the decision would be subject to judicial review and until then, status quo shall be maintained. 

The court order was significant as it addressed the issue of encroachment on government land, which is a common problem in India. The order recognized the plight of landless and homeless individuals, as well as small and marginalized landowners, who often resort to encroachment due to lack of alternatives. 

The court's decision to leave the matter to the policy makers was a pragmatic approach, as it recognized that the issue was complex and required a comprehensive solution. The court's direction to the state government to take a final decision within three months was a positive step, as it provided a timeline for action. 

The court's clarification that the decision would be subject to judicial review was important, as it ensured that the decision would be fair and just. The court's direction to maintain status quo until the decision was taken was also significant, as it prevented any further eviction of individuals from government land. 

Overall, the court order was a balanced and pragmatic approach to the issue of encroachment on government land. It recognized the plight of landless and homeless individuals, as well as small and marginalized landowners, while also acknowledging the need for a comprehensive solution. The court's direction to the state government to take a final decision within three months was a positive step, as it provided a timeline for action. The court's clarification that the decision would be subject to judicial review ensured that the decision would be fair and just.
