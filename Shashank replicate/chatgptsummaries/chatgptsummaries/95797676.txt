In a recent court order, the petitioner, Baiju Lal, withdrew their criminal misc. petition but sought permission to file a fresh application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court. The court dismissed the petition as not pressed but granted the petitioner the liberty to file a fresh application, which will be considered by the trial court in accordance with the law. Additionally, the stay petition has also been dismissed.

The petitioner's initial criminal misc. petition was likely related to a criminal case pending before the trial court. However, for reasons unknown, the petitioner withdrew the petition. Despite this, the petitioner sought permission to file a fresh application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court. Section 91 Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or other material that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code. 

The court granted the petitioner the liberty to file a fresh application, which means that the petitioner is free to file a new application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court. The court also stated that the fresh application will be considered by the trial court in accordance with the law. This means that the trial court will evaluate the application based on the legal requirements and procedures set forth in Section 91 Cr.P.C. and any other relevant laws or regulations.

In addition to dismissing the criminal misc. petition and granting the petitioner the liberty to file a fresh application, the court also dismissed the stay petition. It is unclear what the stay petition was related to, but it is likely that it sought to stay or suspend some aspect of the criminal case pending before the trial court. The court's dismissal of the stay petition means that the trial court can proceed with the case without any further delay or interruption.

Overall, the court's order in this case allows the petitioner to file a fresh application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court, while also dismissing the petitioner's initial criminal misc. petition and a separate stay petition. The court's decision to grant the petitioner the liberty to file a fresh application indicates that the court is willing to consider the petitioner's request for documents or other materials related to the criminal case pending before the trial court. However, the court's order also emphasizes that any such application must be filed and evaluated in accordance with the law.
