The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab issued an order in a case involving Manohar Lal Garg and Manju Goyal and others. The order disposed of 13 appeals arising from orders passed in consumer complaints against Garg for failing to develop a colony as per the specifications and terms and conditions of the Punjab State Urban Development Authority. The case involved allegations of non-compliance with the terms of a license and failure to provide facilities as per specifications.

The court order states that the complainant is entitled to the same rights as the original plot owner and that the developer failed to provide basic amenities as per the terms of the license. The court orders the developer to develop and promote the colony as per specifications and pay compensation to the complainant. The court also determines that the complaint is not barred by limitation and that there is a relationship of consumer and service provider between the parties. The appeal filed by the developer is dismissed.

In another case, the court order states that if there was a relationship of consumer and service provider between Alka Garg and Op No. 1, then the same relationship will remain between the complainant and Op No. 1. The court also notes that Op No. 1 had certain obligations to provide basic amenities to plot holders, as stated in the license agreement. The court finds that Op No. 1 did not provide these amenities and did not take appropriate action with concerned departments to provide them. The court dismisses the appeal and orders the appellant to pay the complainant the deposited amount with interest, and any remaining amount due within 30 days. The court also notes that the points taken in this appeal are similar to those in another appeal, and the findings in that appeal should also be considered.

The court order pertains to four appeals related to a colony development project called "Shakti Nagar" in Mansa. The court found that the reply filed by Op No. 1 was similar to an earlier appeal and dismissed all four appeals with no order as to costs. The appellant in one of the appeals had deposited an amount of Rs. 15,000/- with the commission, which will be remitted to the complainant by way of a crossed cheque/demand draft after the expiry of 45 days. The remaining amount, if any due, shall be paid by the appellant to the complainant within 30 days from the receipt of the copy of the order.

In another case related to the same colony development in Mansa, the court dismissed all four appeals and ordered the appellant to pay any remaining amount due to the complainants within 30 days of receiving the order. The court also directed the registry to remit the deposited amount with interest to the complainants after 45 days, subject to any stay by higher courts. The order was communicated to the parties after a delay due to heavy pendency of court cases.

The court heard arguments in appeals on November 5, 2015, and the order was reserved. The order will now be communicated to the parties according to the rules. The appeals could not be decided within the statutory period due to a heavy backlog of court cases. A copy of the order will be placed on other appeals except for F.A. No. 188 of 2014. The court order was issued on November 17, 2015, by three members.
