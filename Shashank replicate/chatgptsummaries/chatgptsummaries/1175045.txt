The case at hand involves an application filed by The Fertiliser Corporation of India Ltd. under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code against an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate in Bhubaneswar. The order in question rejected an application filed by the Orissa State Prevention and Control of Pollution Board to close a complaint and not proceed with the prosecution against two public servants of the petitioner's company for violating the terms and conditions stipulated in the consent order.

The Board had initially filed a complaint against the two public servants for violating the terms of the consent order. However, they subsequently filed a petition before the learned S.D.J.M. to withdraw the complaint and not pursue the case any further. The learned Magistrate rejected the petition, which led to the present application being filed by The Fertiliser Corporation of India Ltd.

The petitioner argued that the Board had no authority to withdraw the complaint once it had been filed and that the learned Magistrate had erred in rejecting their application to close the complaint. The petitioner further contended that the complaint was filed with mala fide intentions and that the Board had no evidence to support their allegations.

After hearing both parties, the court allowed the petition and quashed the criminal proceeding. The court held that the Board had no authority to withdraw the complaint once it had been filed and that the learned Magistrate had erred in rejecting the petitioner's application to close the complaint. The court also noted that the complaint was filed with mala fide intentions and that the Board had no evidence to support their allegations.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the principle that complaints cannot be withdrawn once they have been filed and that the authorities must have sufficient evidence to support their allegations. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to act in good faith and to follow due process.
