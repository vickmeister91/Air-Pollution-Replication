The court orders discussed in these summaries pertain to the installation of hot mix plants for resurfacing runways and highways. The first court order involves an application by the Airports Authority of India to install hot mix plants near the Indira Gandhi International Airport for resurfacing the runways. The petitioner, M.C. Mehta, opposed the application citing pollution concerns and argued that transportation of hot mix material from existing plants located 8 km away would not pose any problem. The Airports Authority of India argued that due to the constant use of the runways, cracks had developed, and resurfacing was necessary for safe landing and takeoff of aircraft. The court allowed the installation of hot mix plants for a period of one year, subject to certain conditions, including pollution control measures and supervision by the Central Pollution Control Board.

The second court order pertains to a highway contract in Texas that involved the use of a Superpave hot mix overlay. The court discusses the potential health hazards associated with hot mix plants, which emit dust and polyaromatic hydrocarbons that can cause lung illnesses and cancer. The court also notes that hot mix plants have been cited by the US Environmental Protection Agency for violating clean air regulations. The Airports Authority of India was not a party to the case, and the court orders the Airport Authority to file a better affidavit indicating the modern technology that would be employed for commissioning the hot mix plant and the pollution control device that would be utilized for running the hot mix plant coupled with expert opinion. The court also notes that the permissible limit of emission of particulate matters in respect of hot mix plants is 150 mg under the Environment Protection Rules.

The third court order allows the Airports Authority of India to set up Hot Mix Plants for resurfacing the runways at IGI Airport, New Delhi, under the supervision and control of the Central Pollution Control Board. The objection raised by Mr. M.C. Mehta and Central Pollution Control Board regarding the location of the plants in Gurgaon is dismissed, as it would pose security risks and traffic congestion. The Hot Mix Plants must be located at least 3 km away from populated areas and comply with environmental norms. The plants can operate for a year or until the resurfacing is completed, whichever is earlier. The Airports Authority of India can approach the court for further directions or modifications if needed.

Hot mix plants are used for producing asphalt concrete, which is used for resurfacing roads and runways. However, the process of producing asphalt concrete involves heating aggregates and bitumen to high temperatures, which can result in the emission of dust and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. These emissions can cause lung illnesses and cancer, and hot mix plants have been cited by environmental agencies for violating clean air regulations.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in these summaries highlight the importance of balancing the need for infrastructure development with environmental concerns. While hot mix plants are necessary for resurfacing roads and runways, their potential health hazards cannot be ignored. The court orders provide guidelines for the installation and operation of hot mix plants, including pollution control measures and compliance with environmental norms. These guidelines can help ensure that the use of hot mix plants does not result in adverse environmental and health impacts.
