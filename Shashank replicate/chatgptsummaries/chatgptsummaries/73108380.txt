The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by K.K. Ramesh against the Government of India and various state authorities regarding a ban on the use of single-use plastic bags in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner argues that the ban is ineffective without a law made by the State Legislature. The court is considering the challenge to the Government Order in G.O. (Ms)No.84, Environment and Forests (EC.2) Department, dated 25 June, 2018, which imposed the ban. The case is ongoing.

In another petition, the court discusses the issue of banning plastics and imposing stringent punishment for violation. The petitioner argues that the government's ban on plastics is not comprehensive and lacks an effective machinery supported by a statute. The government argues that it has the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment and issued the ban pursuant to a delegation made by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court examines the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and concludes that the State of Tamil Nadu was legally correct in issuing the government order banning the manufacture and use of plastics.

The court also discusses the Environment Act of 1986 and its provisions for the Central Government to regulate and protect the environment. Section 5 of the Act gives the Central Government the power to regulate, prohibit, or close any industry or operation. The court rejects the argument that the State Government has no authority to issue orders related to the environment, as the Central Government delegated this power to them. The court also cites a previous case where the Supreme Court upheld the power of the delegated authority to issue orders prohibiting the location of industries in specified areas. The court dismisses the writ petition and closes the case.

In summary, the court orders discussed the issue of banning single-use plastic bags in Tamil Nadu and the legality of the government's ban on plastics. The court examined the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and concluded that the State of Tamil Nadu was legally correct in issuing the government order banning the manufacture and use of plastics. The court also rejected the argument that the State Government has no authority to issue orders related to the environment, as the Central Government delegated this power to them. The court dismissed the writ petition and closed the case.
