The Delhi High Court has issued several orders related to the operation of radio taxis and the use of diesel vehicles in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi. These orders were issued in response to writ petitions filed by various parties concerned about the impact of these activities on the environment and public health.

In one writ petition, the Association of Radio Taxis sought to enforce orders and advisories related to the operation of radio taxis in Delhi. The petitioner claimed that certain respondents were running illegal and banned radio taxi operations, while the respondents argued that they were technology companies acting as intermediaries between customers and registered taxi operators. The court issued notices to the respondents and allowed them to file counter affidavits within four weeks. The court referred to previous orders related to the use of clean fuels in commercial vehicles and observed that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways' advisory still required registration and licensing from state governments.

In another order, the court discussed the issue of air pollution in Delhi and the use of diesel vehicles, particularly by app-based taxi companies. The court cited previous orders by the Supreme Court regarding the health hazards of diesel emissions and the need for sustainable development and the precautionary principle. The court noted that other app-based companies are using CNG vehicles, indicating that sustainable development is achievable.

The court also issued an order upholding a ban on diesel taxis operating on a point-to-point basis within the NCR of Delhi. The court cited the need to protect the environment and reverse degradation, adopting the "precautionary principle" and emphasizing the need to prioritize environmental protection over economic issues. The court dismissed a petition to stay the ban and directed respondents to enforce the ban. Respondents No.8 to 13 were also directed to shift their vehicles to CNG fuel mode by March 1, 2016, and to file affidavits outlining their plans to phase out diesel vehicles. The court requested suggestions for a mechanism to verify statements and undertakings made by respondents. The matter was listed for further hearing on December 3, 2015.

Overall, these court orders reflect the growing concern about the impact of transportation on the environment and public health in Delhi. The court has taken a strong stance in favor of sustainable development and environmental protection, emphasizing the need to prioritize these issues over economic considerations. The orders also highlight the importance of compliance with government regulations and advisories related to the use of clean fuels in commercial vehicles. As Delhi continues to grapple with air pollution and other environmental challenges, these court orders may serve as a model for other cities and regions seeking to address similar issues.
