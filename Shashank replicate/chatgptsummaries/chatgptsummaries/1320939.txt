The court order in question pertains to a dispute over immoveable property that was mortgaged by the plaintiffs to the first two defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the decree was fraudulently executed, resulting in the sale of the mortgaged properties to the decree-holders. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that their title to the properties has not been affected by the execution proceedings and that no personal decree could have been made against them. The defendants argue that the suit has not been properly valued and that proper court fees have not been paid.

The case revolves around a mortgage agreement between the plaintiffs and the first two defendants, wherein the plaintiffs mortgaged their properties to secure a loan. The defendants subsequently obtained a decree against the plaintiffs for the outstanding amount, and the properties were sold in execution of the decree. The plaintiffs allege that the decree was fraudulently obtained and executed, and that the sale of the properties was illegal.

The plaintiffs filed a suit seeking a declaration that their title to the properties has not been affected by the execution proceedings and that no personal decree could have been made against them. The defendants argued that the suit has not been properly valued and that proper court fees have not been paid. The Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit, holding that it was not properly valued and that proper court fees had not been paid.

The plaintiffs appealed the decision of the Subordinate Judge, arguing that the suit was properly valued and that the plaint was adequately stamped. The High Court allowed the appeal, set aside the decree of the Subordinate Judge, and remitted the case for trial on the merits.

The High Court held that the suit was properly valued and that the plaint was adequately stamped. The court noted that the plaintiffs had valued the suit based on the market value of the properties, which was the correct method of valuation. The court also held that the plaint was adequately stamped, as the plaintiffs had paid the requisite court fees.

The court further held that the defendants had failed to prove that the decree was not fraudulently obtained and executed. The court noted that the defendants had not produced any evidence to show that the plaintiffs had defaulted on the loan or that the properties were sold for a fair price. The court also noted that the defendants had failed to produce any evidence to show that the plaintiffs had been served with notice of the execution proceedings.

In light of these findings, the High Court allowed the appeal, set aside the decree of the Subordinate Judge, and remitted the case for trial on the merits. The court directed the trial court to consider the evidence on record and determine whether the decree was fraudulently obtained and executed, and whether the sale of the properties was illegal. The court also directed the trial court to consider the plaintiffs' claim for a declaration that their title to the properties has not been affected by the execution proceedings and that no personal decree could have been made against them.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a dispute over immoveable property that was mortgaged by the plaintiffs to the first two defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the decree was fraudulently executed, resulting in the sale of the mortgaged properties to the decree-holders. The defendants argue that the suit has not been properly valued and that proper court fees have not been paid.
