The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by Rohen Boro against his conviction under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Arms Act. Boro had been sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50,000. The appeal has been admitted for hearing, and an Amicus Curiae has been appointed to represent the appellant.

The court has ordered for relevant copies to be furnished to the Amicus Curiae and an extra copy of the appeal memo to be given to the counsel for the State/respondent. This is a standard procedure in appeals, as it ensures that all parties have access to the relevant documents and can prepare their arguments accordingly.

In addition, the court has called for the LCR (Lower Court Records) pertaining to the Sessions Case from the Court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Bijni. This is also a standard procedure in appeals, as it allows the higher court to review the proceedings of the lower court and ensure that the trial was conducted fairly and in accordance with the law.

The appointment of an Amicus Curiae is particularly noteworthy in this case. An Amicus Curiae is a Latin term that means "friend of the court." It refers to a person who is not a party to a case but is appointed by the court to assist in the proceedings. The role of an Amicus Curiae is to provide impartial advice to the court on legal issues that may arise in the case.

The appointment of an Amicus Curiae is usually made in cases where the court feels that it would benefit from an independent perspective on the legal issues involved. In this case, it is likely that the court felt that the issues involved in Boro's appeal were complex and required expert legal advice.

The appointment of an Amicus Curiae is also significant because it indicates that the court is taking Boro's appeal seriously. The fact that the court has appointed an independent legal expert to assist in the proceedings suggests that the court is committed to ensuring that justice is done in this case.

Overall, the court order in question is a standard procedural order in an appeal. However, the appointment of an Amicus Curiae is significant and suggests that the court is taking Boro's appeal seriously. It remains to be seen how the appeal will be decided, but the fact that the court has appointed an independent legal expert to assist in the proceedings is a positive sign for Boro's chances of success.
