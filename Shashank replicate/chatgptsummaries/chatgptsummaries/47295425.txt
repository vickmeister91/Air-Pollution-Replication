The Indore Municipal Corporation has been directed by the court to take immediate steps for the establishment of a modern slaughterhouse. This order was issued in response to two writ petitions that sought directions to the Municipal Corporation to construct and maintain a slaughterhouse that would provide meat in hygienic conditions to the citizens. The petitioners argued that it is the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation to establish and maintain a slaughterhouse for this purpose.

The Municipal Corporation, in its defense, stated that it has taken measures for the construction of a modern slaughterhouse but has not been successful. However, the court was not satisfied with this response and directed the Municipal Corporation to take immediate steps for the establishment of a modern slaughterhouse after taking consent under applicable laws.

The court also stated that in the meantime, the petitioners or any other persons may set up a slaughterhouse after taking consent under applicable laws. This means that if the Municipal Corporation fails to establish a modern slaughterhouse, the citizens have the right to set up their own slaughterhouse after obtaining the necessary permissions.

However, the court also made it clear that the slaughtering of animals can only be permitted in the said slaughterhouse with the consent of applicable laws. This means that any slaughterhouse that is set up must comply with all the relevant laws and regulations.

The court's order is significant as it recognizes the importance of providing meat in hygienic conditions to the citizens. It also highlights the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation to establish and maintain a modern slaughterhouse for this purpose. The order also provides citizens with an alternative option if the Municipal Corporation fails to fulfill its responsibility.

In conclusion, the court's order directs the Indore Municipal Corporation to take immediate steps for the establishment of a modern slaughterhouse. It also allows citizens to set up their own slaughterhouse if the Municipal Corporation fails to do so. However, all slaughterhouses must comply with the relevant laws and regulations. This order is significant as it recognizes the importance of providing meat in hygienic conditions to the citizens and highlights the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation to establish and maintain a modern slaughterhouse for this purpose.
