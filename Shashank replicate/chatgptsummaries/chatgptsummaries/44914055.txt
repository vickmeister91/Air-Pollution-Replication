In a recent criminal revision case, the court was tasked with deciding whether to release a seized tractor and trolley on interim custody. The applicant had filed an application for the release of the vehicles, and the court ultimately quashed the impugned order and directed that the seized vehicles be delivered to the applicant subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision was based on provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and a previous Supreme Court decision. Specifically, the court cited Section 451 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows for the release of property seized under certain circumstances. The court also referenced the Supreme Court's decision in State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh, which held that the purpose of seizure is to secure the presence of the accused and to prevent the use of the property for any unlawful purpose.

In light of these provisions and the facts of the case, the court determined that the seized vehicles should be released to the applicant on interim custody. However, the court also imposed certain conditions on the release of the vehicles. Specifically, the applicant was required to furnish a personal bond and an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicles to be used for any anti-social activities.

The court's decision reflects a careful balancing of the interests of the parties involved. On the one hand, the court recognized the importance of securing the presence of the accused and preventing the use of the property for any unlawful purpose. On the other hand, the court also recognized the applicant's right to the possession of his property and the need to avoid undue hardship.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides a useful example of how courts can apply the relevant legal principles to reach a fair and just outcome. By carefully considering the facts of the case and the applicable law, the court was able to balance the competing interests at stake and arrive at a decision that was both legally sound and equitable.
