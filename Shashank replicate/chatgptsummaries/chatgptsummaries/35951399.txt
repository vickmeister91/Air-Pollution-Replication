The first court order pertains to a criminal revision case where the revisionist/accused had filed an application under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for recalling the complainant for cross-examination on certain relevant questions. The trial court had dismissed the application, and the revisionist had filed a revision petition against the order. The court held that the order on the application under Section 311 CrPC was interlocutory in nature and, therefore, the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397(2) CrPC. The court dismissed the revision petition accordingly.

The second court order is not provided in the given text. The text only mentions the court name, case number, and the names of the parties involved.

In the first court order, the revisionist/accused had filed an application under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for recalling the complainant for cross-examination on certain relevant questions. The trial court had dismissed the application, and the revisionist had filed a revision petition against the order. The court held that the order on the application under Section 311 CrPC was interlocutory in nature and, therefore, the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397(2) CrPC. The court dismissed the revision petition accordingly.

Section 311 of the CrPC allows the court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, even if they have not been summoned as a witness or if they have been examined before. The purpose of this section is to enable the court to elicit all necessary and relevant information to arrive at a just decision. However, the power under Section 311 CrPC is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously.

In the present case, the revisionist had filed an application under Section 311 CrPC for recalling the complainant for cross-examination on certain relevant questions. The trial court had dismissed the application, and the revisionist had filed a revision petition against the order. The court held that the order on the application under Section 311 CrPC was interlocutory in nature and, therefore, the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397(2) CrPC.

Section 397(2) CrPC provides that no revision shall lie against an interlocutory order. An interlocutory order is an order that does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties, but only decides some preliminary or incidental issue relating to the case. In the present case, the order on the application under Section 311 CrPC was interlocutory in nature as it did not finally dispose of the rights of the parties, but only decided a preliminary issue relating to the case.

Therefore, the court held that the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397(2) CrPC and dismissed the same. The court's decision was based on the principle that an interlocutory order cannot be challenged by way of revision petition.

In the second court order, the text only mentions the court name, case number, and the names of the parties involved. It is not clear what the court order pertains to or what decision was taken by the court. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a summary of the second court order.
