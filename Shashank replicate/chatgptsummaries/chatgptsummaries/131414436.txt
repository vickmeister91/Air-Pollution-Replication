The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by Sri H Nagaraja Gowda against Sri Shivanna. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order that had been passed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the court dismissed the petition for non-prosecution, as the petitioner failed to appear.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue such a summons or order either on its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceeding.

In this case, it appears that an order had been passed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the petitioner had sought to have that order set aside. However, the petitioner failed to appear before the court, and as a result, the court dismissed the petition for non-prosecution.

Non-prosecution refers to the failure of a party to prosecute a case or petition. When a party fails to appear before the court or fails to take any steps to prosecute their case, the court may dismiss the case for non-prosecution. This is done to ensure that cases are not left pending indefinitely and to ensure that justice is not delayed.

In this case, it is not clear why the petitioner failed to appear before the court. It is possible that they may have had some valid reason for their absence, but without any explanation or justification, the court had no choice but to dismiss the petition for non-prosecution.

It is important for parties to a case to take their obligations seriously and to ensure that they appear before the court when required. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of their case or petition, which can have serious consequences.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by Sri H Nagaraja Gowda against Sri Shivanna. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the court dismissed the petition for non-prosecution as the petitioner failed to appear. It is important for parties to a case to take their obligations seriously and to ensure that they appear before the court when required. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of their case or petition, which can have serious consequences.
