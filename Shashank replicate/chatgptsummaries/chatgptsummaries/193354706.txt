The court order pertains to six different cases related to land disputes in the city of Gulbarga, Karnataka. The first case involves four writ appeals filed by The Corporation of City of Gulbarga and The State of Karnataka against various respondents. The appeals seek to set aside the order/judgment passed by the learned single judge of the court in writ petitions and dismiss the writ petitions with costs. The respondents include individuals and government authorities. The details of the respondents and their occupations are mentioned in the order.

The second case is related to a writ appeal filed by the State of Karnataka against a judgment and order passed by a learned single judge in a writ petition. The petitioners had prayed for setting aside an order issued by the State of Karnataka and for direction to the respondent - Gulbarga Mahanagara Palike to implement their resolution. The court heard the arguments of both parties and went through the entire record and judgments of this Court and the Supreme Court. The court deemed it appropriate to state in detail the sequence of events/facts, which in their opinion, would support the view that they are taking in these appeals. The court then narrated the facts and events related to the land involved in the appeals and concluded that the impugned order was wrong. The court allowed the writ appeal and dismissed the writ petitions with costs.

The third case requires the Corporation and the concerned party to settle their dispute amicably, with the concerned party retaining 14 plots of land and withdrawing all cases pending before the Civil Court and City Survey Office. The Corporation is allowed to deal with the remaining plots and open space. The concerned party is entitled to have their name entered in the Corporation records and is free to deal with the 14 plots retained by them. The order was passed in light of a long-pending litigation over the land and the financial interest of the Corporation. The order was challenged by 14 petitioners in writ petitions filed under Articles 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India.

The fourth case discusses a dispute between the Corporation of City of Gulbarga and the former owner of a property, Seshagiri Rao. The Corporation agreed to allow Rao to retain 14 plots of land in a compromise, and the Commissioner of the Corporation filed a petition to transfer the plots to Rao's name. The State Government later attempted to review the order, but the court found no evidence of fraud and ruled in favor of the petitioners who had purchased the plots from Rao. The court also found several factual errors in the original order, including incorrect assumptions about possession and acquisition of the land.

The fifth case discusses a case where fraud was committed in the acquisition of land by Sri Seshagiri Rao and interested parties in the Corporation. The court found that the Corporation and the Government were misled by false information and that the first order passed by the Government was obtained by fraud. The court also found that the principles of natural justice were not violated as even if the petitioners were granted a hearing, it would be an empty formality. The court held that the interest of the people at large is paramount and that the petitioners cannot be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the Resolution obtained by fraud.

The sixth case discusses the principles of natural justice and the power of the government to cancel resolutions or orders passed by the Corporation. The court concludes that the principles of natural justice need not be observed in this case as the petitioners claiming interest in the property acquired it through a person who had no authority in law. The court also states that the government has the power to cancel resolutions or orders if they are in contravention of the law or prejudicial to the interest of the Corporation. The court rejects the petitioners' claim to ownership of the land and suggests that they should proceed against the landlord or the Corporation for appropriate relief.

In the end, the court order allows the appeals and sets aside the previous order passed by the learned Single Judge. The order passed by the Government is confirmed. The petitioners are allowed to file proceedings for appropriate relief, but the court does not recognize any rights of the petitioners in that regard. Any such proceedings will be considered on merits in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court order deals with various land disputes in Gulbarga and provides detailed accounts of the events leading up to the disputes. The court has made decisions based on the facts presented and has provided relief to the parties involved. The order emphasizes the importance of natural justice and the need to protect the interests of the people at large.
