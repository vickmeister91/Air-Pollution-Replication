The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various civil suits filed by different plaintiffs against the State of Punjab and various authorities. The first court order pertains to a civil suit filed by Dashmesh Educational Society seeking permission to set up a Forest Hill Country Club Resort in village Karoran, Tehsil Kharar, District Ropar. The plaintiff claimed that their application for permission was not rejected within the statutory period of 90 days and therefore deemed to have been sanctioned. The defendants raised objections on various grounds, including lack of jurisdiction, suppression of material facts, and violation of forest laws. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The second court order pertains to a case where the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1 sought permission to establish a country club on a piece of land. The defendants argued that the land was forest land and subject to various laws, but the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1 argued that the land was not forest land and that their application for permission was deemed to have been accepted. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1, granting them a declaration that their application was deemed to have been sanctioned and a permanent injunction against the defendants from interfering with the land or demolishing any construction. The court also framed several issues related to the case and heard evidence from both parties. The case was appealed by the defendants, but the appeals were dismissed by the First Appellate Court. The present Appellants have now challenged the judgment and decree passed by the Courts below in this Second Appeal.

The third court order discusses the role and responsibilities of the Advocate General in legal affairs and their status as a representative of public interest. The court also discusses the scope of second appeal jurisdiction and the circumstances under which the High Court can interfere with findings of fact. The court concludes that a pure question of law can be raised for the first time in a second appeal.

The fourth court order states that a pure question of law can be raised for the first time in a Second Appeal. The court rejects a preliminary objection raised by the defendant's counsel regarding their competence to examine the questions of law sought to be raised in the appeals. The court then proceeds to examine the questions of law in the case and finds that the application submitted by the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1 under Section 5 of the Act was not in the prescribed format and was not moved by them. The court also rejects the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1's application for correction of mistake and substitution of a document. The court concludes that the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1 cannot take advantage of sub-section (6) of Section 6 without complying with the rest of the statutory provisions. The court also rejects the argument that the defect in the application could be overlooked and the application could be entertained on merits.

The fifth court order discusses the interpretation of provisions of the Periphery Control Act, 1952 and the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 in relation to the Forest Hill Country Club resort. The court finds that the "deemed permission" provision in the Periphery Control Act cannot be used to cover illegally carried out constructions and that the competent authority must take an express decision before "deemed permission" can be granted. The court also notes that there is a dual statutory prohibition against the land in question, under both the Periphery Control Act and the Punjab Land Preservation Act, and that permission to erect or re-erect a building cannot be granted without simultaneously obtaining relaxation/exemption from the prohibitory conditions imposed by the Forest Department under the Punjab Land Preservation Act.

The sixth court order discusses the applicability of the Periphery Control Act, 1952 and the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 (P.L.P.A.) on a piece of land located within 10 km of Chandigarh township. The court holds that even if permission to erect a building was granted under the Periphery Control Act, no building could be erected in violation of the statutory embargo incorporated in the Notifications issued under Section 4, 5 and/5-A of the P.L.P.A. against "clearing" of the land or "cutting of trees" etc. The court also discusses the issue of whether the land in question is a "forest land" and concludes that prima facie, it appears to be so in terms of the expanded definition of the term as laid down by the Supreme Court. The court holds that the Forest Departments of the Punjab Government and the Central Government were necessary parties to the suit and the suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary parties.

The seventh court order discusses a case involving mining in areas that have been treated and shown as "forest" by the State Forest Department. The court holds that if the land is deemed to be "forest land," then the State Government has no say in the matter, and the power to accord any permission falls exclusively within the domain of the Central Government. The court also discusses the maintainability of the suit and the relief sought by the Plaintiff-Respondent No. 1.

The eighth court order discusses a case where a plaintiff sought a declaration of the validity of a golf course and buildings on a piece of land, and an injunction to prevent their demolition. The court found that the plaintiff did not seek relief in relation to the land itself, which was necessary for the injunction to be granted. The court also found that the suit should have been
