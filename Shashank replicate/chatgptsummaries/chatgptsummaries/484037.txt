In a recent case, the Divisional Forest Officer seized a vehicle on suspicion of illegal transportation of tiger skin. The respondent filed a petition for interim custody of the vehicle, which was granted by the Magistrate on certain conditions. However, the State filed a writ petition to quash the order.

The court held that the Magistrate had the authority to grant interim custody of the vehicle, but should have directed the respondent to furnish a bank guarantee for the value of the vehicle. The court directed the Magistrate to release the vehicle to the respondent on the conditions provided in the order, but only on production of a bank guarantee for Rs.4 lakhs before the Magistrate.

The case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with cases of suspected illegal activity. In this case, the Divisional Forest Officer acted on suspicion and seized the vehicle without following proper legal procedures. The respondent, on the other hand, filed a petition for interim custody of the vehicle, which was granted by the Magistrate.

However, the State filed a writ petition to quash the order, arguing that the Magistrate had no authority to grant interim custody of the vehicle. The court disagreed with this argument and held that the Magistrate did have the authority to grant interim custody of the vehicle.

However, the court also held that the Magistrate should have directed the respondent to furnish a bank guarantee for the value of the vehicle. This is an important requirement as it ensures that the value of the vehicle is protected in case it is found to have been involved in illegal activity.

The court directed the Magistrate to release the vehicle to the respondent on the conditions provided in the order, but only on production of a bank guarantee for Rs.4 lakhs before the Magistrate. This ensures that the value of the vehicle is protected and that the respondent is held accountable for any illegal activity that may have taken place.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with cases of suspected illegal activity. It also emphasizes the need for accountability and protection of property rights in such cases. By requiring the respondent to furnish a bank guarantee for the value of the vehicle, the court has ensured that the value of the property is protected and that the respondent is held accountable for any illegal activity that may have taken place.
