The court order pertains to a writ petition filed in public interest seeking to declare the action of the official respondents in allowing the 8th respondent to continue mining operations, despite his failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the 4th respondent in his proceedings dated 18.12.2014, as illegal and arbitrary. The court provides a detailed account of the facts of the case and the various notifications and orders issued by the government of Andhra Pradesh regarding the grant of mining lease to the 8th respondent.

The court order discusses the granting of a quarry lease for Laterite Mining to the 8th respondent in Vishakhapatnam, subject to certain conditions. The petitioner alleges that the respondent did not comply with the conditions, including the construction of a boundary wall and payment of compensation for cutting trees. The respondent also allegedly attacked a journalist who was exposing the mining operations. The counter-affidavit argues that the lease was granted with the consent of the villagers and that the leased area was not forest land.

The court order discusses a dispute over the grant of a mining lease to the 8th respondent. The Director of Mines and Geology had granted the lease, but the petitioner alleges that the land is forested and home to wildlife. The court considers reports from various officials and finds that the lease area is not within the reserve forest and has low tree density. The court also notes that the petitioner has made false statements and has a history of criminal activity. The court ultimately upholds the grant of the mining lease to the 8th respondent.

The court order states that the petitioner's photographs are not clear and could have been morphed, and that no incident took place. The 8th respondent had submitted all necessary documents and obtained a quarry lease for Laterite. The petitioner made unfounded allegations and the lease was granted with the consent of the Gram Panchayat. The petitioner had no personal interest in the matter and the Writ Petition should be dismissed. The court also discusses the mandatory nature of the conditions imposed in the NOC proceedings and the 8th respondent's failure to comply with them.

The court order states that the conditions imposed by the DLSC should be read as part of the conditions imposed under the grant and the lease proceedings. Violation of these conditions would result in termination of the lease. The 8th respondent had failed to comply with the conditions imposed by the DLSC to safeguard the environment. The court also discusses various statutory provisions, executive instructions, and other orders issued by government officials related to mining leases and the classification of minerals. The court ultimately concludes that the 8th respondent is bound by the grant order and the statutory lease agreement, and that the conditions imposed by the DLSC are binding on the respondent.

The court order states that a provision in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, which became effective on 12.01.2015, makes all applications received prior to that date ineligible. As a result, an application for a mining lease submitted by the 8th respondent in 2009 was cancelled. The order also outlines various guidelines and procedures for granting mining leases and quarry leases, including the requirement for a No Objection Certificate and the involvement of various officials in the process. The order notes that a quarry lease was granted to the 8th respondent in 2017, subject to certain conditions, but that none of the conditions stipulated in a previous NOC letter were imposed in the lease agreement.

The court order discusses the grant of a quarry lease for laterite to the 8th respondent by the Director of Mines and Geology. The petitioner argues that the conditions stipulated in the NOC letter of the District Collector have been violated. However, the court finds that the conditions imposed in the proceedings of the District Collector dated 18.12.2014 were not communicated to the 8th respondent and were not imposed by the Director of Mines and Geology. The court also examines whether cutting of shrubs and thickets in the mining area is prohibited. The issue of whether the conditions were imposed in the larger public interest of environmental protection of the reserved forest and to protect the wildlife therein is to be examined later in the order.

The court order states that the mining area and its surroundings should be treated as a forest, even though it is not recorded as one. The A.P. Forest Act, 1967 is applicable to Schedule Agency Areas, and as there exists tree growth in the subject area, it falls within the definition of "Forest" under Section 28-A(a) of the Act. The mining lease holder did not obtain permission from any competent authority to cut trees or other growth in the leased area, and the area through which the road was formed to the 'Y' junction. The lease is liable to be cancelled as per Rule 12(1)(5)(h(xii) of the 1966 Rules. The court also mentions that the subject land is not a "private forest" falling within the ambit of Section 28-B of the 1967 Act.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Water, Land and Trees Act, 2002 and the Andhra Pradesh Water, Land and Trees Rules, 2004, which relate to tree plantation in urban areas and prohibit felling of trees or branches without prior permission. The court also discusses the definition of "forest" and "
