Sunil Shrivas, along with two others, was arrested for an offense under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The trio had erected a wire for hunting wild animals within a forest area, which was connected to a 110 KV electrical line. Unfortunately, a person came in contact with the live wire and died due to electrocution. 

Sunil Shrivas applied for bail, and the court allowed the application, directing the applicant to be released on bail on executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety for the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. 

Section 304-A of the IPC deals with causing death by negligence. It states that whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to two years, or with a fine, or with both. 

Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act deals with hunting in a prohibited area. It states that whoever hunts in any sanctuary, national park, or closed area shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of up to three years, or with a fine, or with both. 

The court's decision to grant bail to Sunil Shrivas is based on several factors. Firstly, the offense under Section 304-A of the IPC is bailable, which means that the accused has the right to apply for bail. Secondly, the court may grant bail if it is satisfied that the accused is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. 

In this case, the court found that Sunil Shrivas had no criminal antecedents and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court also noted that the investigation was complete, and the trial was likely to take some time. Therefore, the court allowed the application for bail and directed the applicant to be released on bail on executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety for the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. 

It is essential to note that bail is not an acquittal or discharge of the accused. It is merely a temporary release from custody until the trial is complete. The accused must attend all court hearings and comply with any conditions imposed by the court while on bail. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of bail and re-arrest of the accused. 

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Sunil Shrivas is based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the accused's criminal antecedents, and the likelihood of absconding or tampering with evidence. The court has directed the applicant to be released on bail on executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety for the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. It is essential to note that bail is not an acquittal or discharge of the accused, and the accused must comply with any conditions imposed by the court while on bail.
