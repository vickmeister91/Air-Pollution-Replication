The court order pertains to the preparation of District Survey Reports (DSR) for minor minerals other than sand in the state of Jharkhand. The court has called for uniform guidelines for the preparation of DSR in the light of a notification from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC), Government of India. The MoEF & CC has filed three affidavits, with their latest stating that DSR is mandatory for all minor minerals, and that Appendix-X only deals with sand and bajri. The court has discussed legal issues regarding the jurisdiction of the state government to frame such formats and the power of delegation available to the Central Government. The matter has been adjourned for further clarification from the MoEF & CC.

The order states that the power to prepare DSRs has been delegated to the District Environment Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA) by the Central Government. However, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) has been inconsistent in its stance on whether separate formats for DSRs are required for different minor minerals. The order also outlines the procedure for preparing DSRs, which includes conducting surveys and placing the draft report in the public domain for comments. The DSRs will form the basis for environmental clearance and project appraisal, and will be updated every five years.
