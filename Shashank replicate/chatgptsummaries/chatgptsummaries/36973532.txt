The Gauhati High Court has registered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to investigate the illegal poaching and killing of wild animals in the Kaziranga National Park. The court has also received additional petitions regarding the removal of human habitation and encroachment in animal corridors in and around the park. The court has ordered an inquiry into the matter and required the necessary formalities to be followed before adding the second addition to the park.

The court order pertains to the Kaziranga National Park and its second addition. Eight residents filed a case contending that the necessary formalities under the Wildlife Protection Act and the Forest Rights Act of 2006 were not complied with before adding the second addition to the park. The court has ordered the Director of KNP to submit a detailed report on the geographical features, flora and fauna, animal life, and contributory reasons aiding poaching and illegal activities. The court has expressed concern about poaching and directed the Director to suggest proposals for curbing poaching and preserving the endangered species. The court has also constituted a high-power committee to count residences and survey the population in the residential buildings, huts, etc. The committee visited the actual habitation sites and made several observations and decisions.

The court order pertains to the eviction of encroachers from the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India. The court has directed the Deputy Commissioners to evict residents from the park area, including the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th additions, as well as residents of Bandardubi, Deuchur Chang, and Palkhowa. The court has also directed the Revenue Authority to furnish copies of all the pattas granted to persons in the 3rd Addition and ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Nagaon to evict encroachment of government land from Bandardubi and Deuchur Chang villages. The court has also directed the Superintendent of Police(Border), Nagaon, to verify the nationality of encroachers in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Additions and take biometric data of all residents in these areas. The court has also noted that there appear to be improprieties and illegalities in granting pattas and legalizing encroachments.

The court order discusses the acquisition of land rights in areas proposed to be declared as Sanctuaries and National Parks. The court states that the State Government did not violate any law in issuing a notification in 1995, which allowed villagers to live in and around Sanctuaries and National Parks as long as their rights were not acquired and final notifications were not issued. The court also discusses the claims of villagers in Banderdubi and Deurchur Chan villages and the satellite images of Kaziranga National Park. The court refers to the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the definition of "forest land" as explained by the Supreme Court in the Godavarman case. The court rejects the claims of villagers as they could not establish title over the land.

The court order pertains to the acquisition of land for the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India. The court has rejected the claims of several petitioners who asserted their rights over the land, stating that all claims have been examined and rejected, and possession of the land has been handed over to the forest wildlife division. The court has emphasized the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment, and has stated that technicalities should not stand in the way of rendering justice. The court has recommended that the final notification be issued to constitute the Kaziranga National Park under the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The court order states that even if the final notification for land acquisition is not issued, individuals cannot claim the right to stay on the land if their claims have been adjudicated. The court prioritizes the interests of the Kaziranga National Park, a World Heritage Site, over the claims of the petitioners. The National Board's recommendation can be taken into consideration, but the government's decision to expand the park cannot be challenged. The court orders the eviction of inhabitants in certain areas of the park within one month.

In summary, the Gauhati High Court has taken several measures to protect the Kaziranga National Park and its wildlife. The court has ordered an inquiry into the illegal poaching and killing of wild animals and has expressed concern about poaching. The court has also directed the eviction of encroachers from the park area and has rejected the claims of several petitioners who asserted their rights over the land.
