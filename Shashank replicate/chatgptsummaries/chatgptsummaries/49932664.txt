The High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur, issued a court order that lists the parties involved in three writ petitions (WP.3390.09, WP.2207.08, and WP.2493.10). The petitioners and respondents are named, along with their authorized signatories and legal representatives. The order also mentions the names of the lawyers representing the parties. However, no details about the content or outcome of the petitions are provided.

The court order involves a writ petition filed by various seed companies and associations against the State of Maharashtra and the Union of India. The petitioners are producers of cotton seed, and the respondents include government departments and organizations. The judgment was delivered on August 13, 2013, and the court heard arguments from both sides before making its decision.

The court order discusses three separate cases where petitioners challenged the validity of statutes and notifications related to the price control of cotton seed in Maharashtra. An interim order was passed in each case, and the respondents provided material to support their actions. The court heard all cases together and referred to several central acts and rules related to the regulation of essential commodities and seeds. However, the judgment is not specified in the summary.

The court order pertains to the regulation of the supply, distribution, sale, and pricing of cotton seeds in Maharashtra. The Environment Protection Act of 1986 and the Rules for Manufacture, Use, Import, Export, and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells of 1989 are cited as relevant legislation. The Seeds Act of 1966 and Seeds Rules of 1968 are also mentioned. The court order includes definitions of terms such as "cotton seed" and "producer." The order also provides a timeline of relevant legislation dating back to 1955.

In 2006, a committee recommended removing unnecessary restrictions on market forces and deleting cotton seed from the Essential Commodities Act, while retaining the power to add or remove any commodity in the public interest. In 2007, cotton seed was deleted from the Act, but in 2008, an ordinance was published fixing the price of cotton seed. The ordinance was replaced by the Maharashtra Cotton Seed Act in 2009, but cotton seed was brought back into the list of essential commodities for six months in 2009. In 2010, the state issued a notification fixing the maximum retail price of cotton seeds, and the central government extended the period of the notification from six months to one year.

The court order discusses the distribution of legislative powers and legislative relations in the Indian Constitution, specifically Articles 245 to 255. The order also references a notification issued by the Central Government regarding cotton seeds and the relevant constitutional provisions related to "repugnancy" and "price control." The order includes definitions and relevant entries from the Seventh Schedule List II - State List, such as agriculture and the production, supply, and distribution of goods.

The court order discusses the provisions of List III, which includes trade and commerce in various industries and products, as well as price control. The purpose and object of the Maharashtra Cotton Seed Act/Ordinances are also outlined, including the need to regulate the supply, distribution, and sale of cotton seeds in the interests of farmers, as well as the background behind the notification of the maximum sale price of certain types of cotton seeds under the Act.

The Government of Maharashtra has issued a court order to fix the maximum sale price of certain types of cotton seeds under the Maharashtra Cotton Seeds Act. The decision was made after considering the increase in production costs, processing costs, and trait value (royalty) component of transgenic cotton seeds. The maximum sale price was fixed based on reasonable trait values and cost of other relevant components. The order also includes a table of the cotton seed prices fixed from 2002 to 2010.

The court order discusses a case regarding the controlled price of cotton seeds in Maharashtra. The petitioners did not challenge subsequent notifications fixing the price in later years. The order also discusses the concept of repugnancy and cites various judgments related to it. The Constitution Bench decisions on repugnancy are also mentioned. The order concludes by stating that the declaration by Parliament is necessary for the controlled price to be effective.

The court order states that if Parliament declares it is in the public interest to regulate and develop mines under the control of the Union, then the legislative declaration covers the entire field. Repugnancy arises when two enactments within the competence of two legislatures collide, and one legislature has superiority over the other. The intention of Parliament was to cover the entire field, leaving no scope for argument until rules were framed. The subject matter/intention is the test. The court dealt with various products in Belsund Sugar, and it is clear that the subject matter/intention is the test. The order cites several Supreme Court cases in support of the submissions.

The court order cites various paragraphs from previous judgments and distinguishes them from the current case. The principles relied upon by the State are that there is no repugnancy between the Central and State laws, and therefore, there is no need for the State to obtain the President's assent. The court also notes that previous cases cited by the State have been distinguished by the petitioners' counsel.

The court order discusses the issue of repugnancy between a Central and State Act, and
