The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner, who is the Director of a real estate company, is a prosecution witness. The defacto-complainant in the case filed a petition to recall the petitioner for further cross-examination regarding the possession of an original power of attorney. The petitioner denies having possession of the document.

The court finds that the defacto-complainant has no independent locus standi to file such a petition. Locus standi refers to the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in court. In other words, the defacto-complainant does not have the legal standing to file the petition. The court notes that the defacto-complainant is not the complainant in the case and has no direct interest in the matter. Therefore, the court sets aside the order passed by the lower court.

The criminal original petition is allowed, which means that the petitioner's request to be relieved from further cross-examination is granted. The related criminal miscellaneous petitions are dismissed, which means that any other petitions related to this case are no longer valid.

It is important to note that the possession of the original power of attorney is a crucial piece of evidence in this case. A power of attorney is a legal document that gives someone else the authority to act on behalf of another person. In this case, the power of attorney is related to the ownership of a property. The defacto-complainant alleges that the petitioner has possession of the original power of attorney and is withholding it. The petitioner denies this allegation.

The court's decision to set aside the order passed by the lower court is significant because it upholds the principle of locus standi. This principle ensures that only those who have a direct interest in a case can file petitions or appear in court. It prevents frivolous or malicious petitions from being filed by those who have no stake in the matter.

Furthermore, the court's decision to allow the criminal original petition and dismiss the related criminal miscellaneous petitions is a clear indication that the petitioner's request to be relieved from further cross-examination is valid. The court has accepted the petitioner's denial of possession of the original power of attorney and has granted their request to be excused from further cross-examination on this matter.

In conclusion, the court order in this criminal case upholds the principle of locus standi and grants the petitioner's request to be relieved from further cross-examination. The defacto-complainant's petition to recall the petitioner for further cross-examination regarding the possession of an original power of attorney is dismissed. This decision is significant because it ensures that only those with a direct interest in a case can file petitions or appear in court, and it upholds the integrity of the legal system.
