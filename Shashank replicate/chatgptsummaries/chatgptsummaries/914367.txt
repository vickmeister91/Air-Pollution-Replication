The State of U.P. and Additional Director of Education (Secondary) U.P. have filed a Special Appeal against a judgment and order passed by a learned single judge in a writ petition. The petitioner, Irfan Ahmad Siddiqui, was appointed as Assistant Master (Chemistry) in a Government Inter College in 1971. In 1981, he applied for a teaching position in Nigeria without obtaining permission from the government. He was offered the job and left India without obtaining leave or a no-objection certificate. The government subsequently issued orders rejecting his request for permission to go on deputation or to proceed on leave without pay. The petitioner did not challenge these orders and did not communicate his whereabouts to the government. The government made efforts to contact him through the Indian High Commission in Nigeria, but he did not respond. The learned single judge set aside the impugned orders and declared that the petitioner continues in his service on the post of lecturer and is entitled to pay and all consequential benefits. The State of U.P. and Additional Director of Education (Secondary) U.P. have filed a Special Appeal against this judgment.

The court order discusses a case where an employee neglected his duties and took a foreign assignment without permission, causing harm to the students and the educational institution. The court found that the employer made all efforts to serve notices to the employee, who deliberately avoided them. The court also found that the employee cannot claim relief of reinstatement and back wages after a long gap of 17 years. The court dismissed the writ petition and set aside the judgment and order of the learned single judge. No costs were awarded.
