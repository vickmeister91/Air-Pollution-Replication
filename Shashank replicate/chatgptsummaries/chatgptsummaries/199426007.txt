The Rajasthan High Court issued an order on August 19, 2009, in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10014/2009. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the petitioner challenging an order passed by the Member Secretary under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner had contended that the impugned order was passed without jurisdiction and was therefore illegal and void.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the petitioner, directed that notice be issued to the respondents and that the operation of the impugned order in question be stayed until further orders. The court also noted that the Board alone is empowered under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the impugned order had been passed by the Member Secretary, to whom no power had been delegated by the authority competent under the Act, 1981.

The court's order was significant as it clarified the scope of the powers of the Member Secretary under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the Member Secretary could not exercise the powers of the Board under Section 31-A of the Act, 1981, and that any order passed by the Member Secretary in this regard would be without jurisdiction and therefore illegal and void.

The court's order also highlighted the importance of following due process and ensuring that the authority competent under the Act, 1981, delegates its powers to the appropriate officials. The court's order ensured that the impugned order was stayed until further orders, thereby preventing any adverse consequences for the petitioner.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10014/2009 was a significant one as it clarified the scope of the powers of the Member Secretary under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's order ensured that due process was followed and that the impugned order was stayed until further orders, thereby protecting the interests of the petitioner.
