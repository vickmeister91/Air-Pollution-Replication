The court order in question pertains to a case where the plaintiffs had filed a suit for declaration that they were the owners of a piece of land. The lower courts had dismissed the suit, stating that the plaintiffs had not become the owners of the land and that the conveyance deed executed in their favor was under a mistaken belief. The plaintiffs had then appealed to the higher court, which has now dismissed their appeal.

The case revolves around a piece of land that was originally owned by one Mr. X. In 1984, Mr. X executed a conveyance deed in favor of the plaintiffs, who were his nephews. The deed stated that Mr. X was selling the land to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 10,000. The plaintiffs claimed that they had paid the sum to Mr. X and had become the owners of the land.

However, in 1990, Mr. X executed another conveyance deed in favor of his daughter, the defendant in this case. This deed stated that Mr. X was selling the land to his daughter for a sum of Rs. 20,000. The plaintiffs claimed that they were not aware of this deed and that it was executed under a mistaken belief.

The lower courts had dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiffs, stating that they had not become the owners of the land and that the conveyance deed executed in their favor was under a mistaken belief. The plaintiffs had then appealed to the higher court, which has now dismissed their appeal.

The court found no merit in the appeal and dismissed it, stating that no substantial question of law arose in the case. The court noted that the lower courts had considered all the evidence on record and had come to a reasoned conclusion. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had failed to produce any evidence to show that the conveyance deed executed in their favor was not under a mistaken belief.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where the plaintiffs had filed a suit for declaration that they were the owners of a piece of land. The lower courts had dismissed the suit, stating that the plaintiffs had not become the owners of the land and that the conveyance deed executed in their favor was under a mistaken belief. The higher court has now dismissed the appeal filed by the plaintiffs, stating that no substantial question of law arose in the case. The court found no merit in the appeal and noted that the lower courts had considered all the evidence on record and had come to a reasoned conclusion.
