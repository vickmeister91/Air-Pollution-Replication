The case of Sau Ram involved a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to challenge an order passed by the revisional court. The petitioner had previously filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to summon certain documents, which was rejected by the trial court. The revisional court had upheld this decision, prompting the petitioner to file the current petition.

The court began by examining the jurisdiction of the revisional court and found that it had not acted illegally in upholding the trial court's decision. The court then went on to consider the right of the accused to issue summons for the production of documents. It was noted that this right is not an absolute one and must be balanced against other factors such as the relevance and admissibility of the documents in question.

Ultimately, the court dismissed the petition summarily, stating that it was not a fit case for the power of second judicial review to be exercised under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. This decision highlights the importance of carefully considering the relevant factors when seeking to summon documents in a criminal case.
