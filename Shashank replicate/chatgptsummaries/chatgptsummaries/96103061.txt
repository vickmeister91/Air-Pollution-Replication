The Supreme Court of India has recently issued several court orders related to environmental issues. One of the orders pertains to a writ petition filed by T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad against the Union of India and others regarding the appointment of a National Regulator in accordance with a previous court judgment. The matter was heard by Justices Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta, and the court ordered the matter to be listed in the first week of August 2018. The order also includes details of other interlocutory applications related to the same case.

In another case, the Delhi Jal Board has filed an application seeking permission to use 1.6 acres of forest land in Sanjay Van to lay a water pipeline. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) has recommended that the Delhi Jal Board be permitted to use the forest land for the pipeline project, subject to certain conditions. The Supreme Court has accepted the CEC's report and disposed of the application.

The court has also listed an application for hearing in July 2018 related to environmental issues. Additionally, the court has listed two applications for hearing on 24th April 2018. These cases are related to environmental concerns and will be heard by the Supreme Court.

The court's decision to list the matter related to the appointment of a National Regulator in August 2018 is significant as it pertains to the implementation of a previous court judgment. The appointment of a National Regulator is crucial for the effective implementation of environmental laws and regulations in the country. The court's decision to hear the matter in August indicates that it is taking the issue seriously and is committed to ensuring that the judgment is implemented in a timely and effective manner.

The court's decision to permit the Delhi Jal Board to use forest land for the pipeline project is also significant. The court has accepted the CEC's report, which recommends that the project be permitted subject to certain conditions. This decision is important as it demonstrates the court's willingness to balance environmental concerns with the need for development and infrastructure projects.

The court's decision to list two applications for hearing in April 2018 and one application for hearing in July 2018 also indicates its commitment to addressing environmental concerns in a timely manner. These cases are likely to be related to issues such as pollution, deforestation, and other environmental concerns.

Overall, the Supreme Court's recent court orders related to environmental issues demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that environmental laws and regulations are effectively implemented in the country. The court's decisions to hear cases related to environmental concerns in a timely manner and to balance environmental concerns with the need for development and infrastructure projects are significant and demonstrate its commitment to protecting the environment.
