The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed an order in a case filed by Sheikh Wahib and another person against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioners were aggrieved by an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Panna in a case registered against them under the Wild Life Protection Act. The forest authorities had seized a motorcycle with two persons on it, and recovered pellets, gunpowder, a knife, and a muzzle-loading rifle from them. The Assistant Ranger had filed a complaint against the petitioners, but the court held that only the Chief Wild Life Warden, Wild Life Wardens, and Forest Range Officers were authorized to file such complaints.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings against the petitioners, but allowed the State to file a complaint in accordance with the law. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 55 of the Wild Life Protection Act, which deals with the power to investigate and prosecute offences under the Act. The court held that the power to file a complaint under the Act is vested only with the Chief Wild Life Warden, Wild Life Wardens, and Forest Range Officers, and not with any other officer.

The court also observed that the Assistant Ranger, who had filed the complaint against the petitioners, was not authorized to do so under the Act. The court held that the Assistant Ranger was not a Forest Range Officer, and therefore, he could not file a complaint under the Act. The court further held that the Assistant Ranger was not even authorized to investigate offences under the Act, and therefore, the investigation conducted by him was illegal.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the powers of the officers under the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto. The Act also provides for the establishment of various authorities for the implementation of its provisions.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the due process of law. The court held that the Assistant Ranger had acted beyond his powers by filing a complaint against the petitioners, and that the investigation conducted by him was illegal. The court's decision emphasizes the need for the authorities to follow the due process of law while investigating and prosecuting offences under the Act.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's decision in the case filed by Sheikh Wahib and another person against the State of Madhya Pradesh clarifies the powers of the officers under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court held that only the Chief Wild Life Warden, Wild Life Wardens, and Forest Range Officers were authorized to file complaints under the Act, and that the Assistant Ranger was not authorized to do so. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following the due process of law while investigating and prosecuting offences under the Act.
