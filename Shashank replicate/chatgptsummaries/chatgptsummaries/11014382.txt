The court order pertains to a revision filed by the accused in a case under Section 138 NI Act. The accused had filed an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling the complainant and seeking an opportunity to cross-examine him, which was dismissed by the Ld. MM. The accused filed a revision against this order. The court observed that the impugned order was an interlocutory order and the maintainability of the revision was under a cloud. The court defined the term "interlocutory order" and stated that it does not decide any valuable right of the accused. The court also cited various cases and tests to determine the finality of a judgment or order.

The court order discusses the definition and nature of interlocutory orders, which are steps taken towards final adjudication and regulate procedure without affecting the rights or liabilities of the parties. The order cites various cases to support the idea that interlocutory orders only decide specific aspects or issues in a proceeding and do not conclude the matter. The court also notes that revisional jurisdiction should be exercised within the four corners of Section 397 Cr. P.C. and that interference with every interlocutory order can delay the trial. The revision in question is disposed of as not pressed, and a copy of the order is sent to the trial court.

The court order begins by discussing the revision filed by the accused in a case under Section 138 NI Act. The accused had filed an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling the complainant and seeking an opportunity to cross-examine him, which was dismissed by the Ld. MM. The accused filed a revision against this order. The court observed that the impugned order was an interlocutory order and the maintainability of the revision was under a cloud. The court defined the term "interlocutory order" and stated that it does not decide any valuable right of the accused. The court also cited various cases and tests to determine the finality of a judgment or order.

The court then delves into the definition and nature of interlocutory orders. It explains that interlocutory orders are steps taken towards final adjudication and regulate procedure without affecting the rights or liabilities of the parties. The court cites various cases to support the idea that interlocutory orders only decide specific aspects or issues in a proceeding and do not conclude the matter. The court notes that such orders are not final and can be modified or vacated by the court at any time before the final judgment is pronounced.

The court also highlights the importance of exercising revisional jurisdiction within the four corners of Section 397 Cr. P.C. It notes that interference with every interlocutory order can delay the trial and that revisional jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases. The court emphasizes that the revisional jurisdiction should not be used as a substitute for an appeal and that the revisional court should not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the trial court unless there is a manifest error or a miscarriage of justice.

The court then disposes of the revision in question as not pressed and sends a copy of the order to the trial court. The court's order serves as a reminder to the legal fraternity that revisional jurisdiction should be exercised judiciously and that interlocutory orders should not be interfered with unless there is a compelling reason to do so. The order also highlights the importance of understanding the nature and definition of interlocutory orders and their role in the legal process.
