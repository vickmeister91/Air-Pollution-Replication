The court order pertains to four criminal revision petitions filed by the State of Punjab against individuals who were acquitted of charges under the Indian Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act. The State argued that the land in question belonged to the Forest Department and could not be used for any other purpose without prior permission from the Central Government. However, both the trial court and the appellate court had acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence connecting them to the alleged offense. The court ultimately dismissed the State's petitions challenging the acquittals.

The case involved allegations of illegal felling of trees and bushes from disputed land. The State of Punjab had filed criminal revision petitions against the acquittal of the accused by the trial court and the appellate court. The State argued that the land in question belonged to the Forest Department and could not be used for any other purpose without prior permission from the Central Government. The State contended that the accused had illegally removed trees and bushes from the land without permission, in violation of the Indian Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act.

However, the trial court and the appellate court had acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence connecting them to the alleged offense. The prosecution had failed to provide evidence connecting the accused with the alleged offense of removing trees and bushes from disputed land. The damage report presented by the prosecution did not mention the khasra number of the land inspected, and there was no evidence to prove that the inspected land was in fact forest land covered under the notification.

The court found no merit in the contentions raised by the petitioner-state and dismissed the revision petitions due to considerable unexplained delay in filing and lack of valid reasons. The court observed that the State had failed to provide any evidence to support its claim that the land in question belonged to the Forest Department. The court also noted that the prosecution had failed to provide any evidence connecting the accused with the alleged offense.

The court further observed that the prosecution had failed to provide any evidence to prove that the land in question was forest land covered under the notification. The court noted that the damage report presented by the prosecution did not mention the khasra number of the land inspected, and there was no evidence to prove that the inspected land was in fact forest land covered under the notification.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the State's petitions challenging the acquittals of the accused due to lack of evidence connecting them to the alleged offense. The court observed that the State had failed to provide any evidence to support its claim that the land in question belonged to the Forest Department, and that the prosecution had failed to provide any evidence connecting the accused with the alleged offense.
