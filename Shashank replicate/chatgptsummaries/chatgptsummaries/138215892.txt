The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by Sri Wasim, also known as Wasim Shariff, who was seeking bail in a case registered against him under Section 135(a) and 135(b) of the Customs Act, 1962, read with the Wild Life Act, 1972. The specific details of the case are not provided in the court order, but it can be inferred that the charges against Sri Wasim are related to customs violations and wildlife crimes.

However, before the court could rule on the bail petition, the petitioner's counsel filed a memo stating that the petition had become infructuous. This means that the circumstances surrounding the case had changed in such a way that the bail petition was no longer relevant or necessary. The court therefore dismissed the petition as having become infructuous.

It is unclear from the court order what exactly led to the petition becoming infructuous. It could be that Sri Wasim was granted bail by another court or that the charges against him were dropped altogether. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the bail petition was no longer necessary and was therefore dismissed.

The Customs Act, 1962 is a law that regulates the import and export of goods in India. It provides for the levy and collection of customs duties and also contains provisions for the prevention of smuggling and other customs-related offenses. Section 135 of the Act deals with offenses relating to evasion of duty or prohibitions on import or export of goods. Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 135 specifically deal with cases where the value of the goods in question exceeds a certain threshold.

The Wild Life Act, 1972 is a law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants in India. It regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas. It is likely that the charges against Sri Wasim under this Act are related to the illegal trade in wildlife or the violation of protected area regulations.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail petition filed by Sri Wasim in a case registered against him under the Customs Act, 1962 and the Wild Life Act, 1972. However, the petition became infructuous before the court could rule on it, and was therefore dismissed. The specific details of the case are not provided in the court order, but it can be inferred that the charges against Sri Wasim are related to customs violations and wildlife crimes. The Customs Act, 1962 and the Wild Life Act, 1972 are both important laws that regulate trade and protect the environment in India.
