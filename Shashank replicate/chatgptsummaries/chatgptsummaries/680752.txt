The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions, one filed by Sundaram Brake Linings Ltd. and the other by Suriya Sweets. Sundaram Brake Linings Ltd. filed a writ of Mandamus against the Corporation of Chennai, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic (South), Vepery, Chennai and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to take action against Suriya Sweets for operating a commercial establishment without necessary approvals and licenses. Suriya Sweets filed a writ petition to quash the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and to direct them to pass orders on the consent application.

The court considered the location of Suriya Sweets and the regulations for construction of buildings in the primary residential use zone. The court order discusses the permissible non-residential uses in primary residential use zones and mixed residential use zones under the Development Control Rules. The case of Suriya Sweets, a sweet stall located in a primary residential use zone, is also discussed.

The court holds that Suriya Sweets cannot be regarded as a cottage industry as it is a commercial concern. However, the manufacture and sale of confectionery sweets and savouries is permissible in a primary residential use zone as an accessory use to the main purpose of manufacture. The court also holds that the expression "confectionery sweets" in the Development Control Rules should be extended to include savouries.

The court order states that Suriya Sweets, a commercial establishment, has violated the Development Control Rules by operating in a primary residential use zone and employing more than 25 employees. The court also notes that Suriya Sweets has not obtained necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board and directs the board to consider their applications for consent and pass necessary orders within a month.

The court dismisses the argument of locus standi raised by Suriya Sweets and concludes that both writ petitions are disposed of with the given directions.
