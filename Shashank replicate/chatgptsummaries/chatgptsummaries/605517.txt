The court order pertains to a case where M/s Acfoli Inc approached the court seeking direction to the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to allot them a plot for setting up a dyeing unit in the earmarked 'Dyeing Zone' Sector 29 Part-II, Panipat. The court order provides details of the policy decision taken by the Environment Protection Council, Haryana, to relocate small-scale industrial units working in congested areas of the town to a separate industrial estate. The court notes that the petitioner had been allotted a plot but failed to make the required payments, resulting in the cancellation of the allotment. The court also notes that the HUDA had issued an advertisement inviting applications for allotment of industrial plots in the Dyeing Zone, Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat.

The court order states that the petitioner had applied for a plot in the Dyeing Zone but was a defaulter when a plot was allotted to them earlier. The Board issued a notice to the petitioner to shift their unit to Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, within 45 days under the 'Shifting of Dyeing Units Project'. The petitioner requested to apply again for allotment of plot in response to fresh advertisement dated 11.7.2007. The court accepted the petitioner's offer to re-allot the plots of the sizes of 2100 square meters and 5000 square meters respectively at the current price. The court gave directions to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to re-allot the plots and for the petitioners to pay 50% of the total price in lump-sum within two months.

The court has issued an order to stop any further correspondence on the matter, as stated by Judge M.M. Kumar and Judge Jora Singh on December 11, 2008.
