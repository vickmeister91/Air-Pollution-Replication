The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases under the Negotiable Instruments Act. The first case involves an appellant named Shobha Ram who was convicted under section 138 of the Act and sentenced to three months of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 60,000. The complainant had filed a case against Ram for failing to make regular payments on a personal loan and issuing a dishonored check. Ram claimed that he had settled the matter with the complainant for Rs. 9,500 prior to the legal notice being issued. However, the trial court did not believe his defense and found him guilty. The appellant argued that no offense had been made out against him under section 138 of the NI Act.

In the second case, the appellant settled a loan with the respondent for Rs.9,500, but the respondent still prosecuted the appellant for an offense under section 138 of the NI Act. The appellant argued that the check in question was given as security and was misused by the respondent. The respondent argued that the settlement letter and payment receipt were fake and altered. The court found that the settlement letter was filed by the appellant and therefore it was their responsibility to prove its genuineness. The court also found that the check was issued in discharge of the liability shown in the statement of account.

The third court order states that the settlement letter and payment receipt presented by the appellant were not proven to be genuine and reliable. The court also found that there was no proof of a loan recall notice or demand for the loan amount, and the statement of account did not reflect any entry to show that the loan was ever recalled or demanded. Therefore, the court upheld the impugned judgment and sentence order.

In the fourth case, the court found that the complainant failed to prove that the loan was ever recalled or demanded, and that there was no liability of Rs.36,123 on the appellant. The court also found that the complaint should have been filed by the payee of the cheque, India Bulls Credit Services Ltd., and not by India Bulls Financial Services Ltd. The court found that there was no evidence to show that India Bulls Credit Services Ltd. had amalgamated into India Bulls Financial Services Ltd. and therefore, the complainant was not competent to file the complaint. The appeal was allowed, and the appellant was acquitted of the offense under section 138 of the NI Act.

Finally, the fifth court order states that the personal bond or surety bond of the appellant in the case of Shobha Ram Vs. Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd. stands discharged. The appellant is required to furnish a personal bond of Rs.10,000 with one surety of the same amount, with an undertaking to appear before the appellate court upon receiving notice. The order was announced in open court on May 30, 2015, at the ASJ-01/Dwarka Courts in New Delhi.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to cases under the Negotiable Instruments Act and involve disputes over dishonored checks and loan settlements. The courts have made various findings regarding the genuineness of settlement letters and payment receipts, the recall or demand of loans, and the competency of complainants to file complaints. The orders have resulted in convictions, acquittals, and the discharge of personal and surety bonds.
