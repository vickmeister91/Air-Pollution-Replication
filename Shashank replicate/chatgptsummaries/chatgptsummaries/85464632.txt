The National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Srigangangar district. The NGT directed the State of Rajasthan to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The State was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water. The court also directed the registry to find out the status of a related case transferred from the High Court and listed it along with these matters.

The court ordered the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from the distributories and potable water rendered there-from, analyze them, and place the analysis reports before the court. The state has been directed to come out with comprehensive short-term and long-term schemes to render the canal and its distributories free of encroachments and consequent contamination within a given time frame. The state has been given a deadline to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court has directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court has also directed the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories and place the action taken report in respect of enforcement of the direction imposing the compensation or damages before the court.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The National Green Tribunal had passed an order in October 2015, directing the removal of encroachments and plugging of inlets into the canal. The compliance report filed by the state government did not disclose the number of encroachers who had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court directed the removal of all encroachments within one month and ordered the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The state government was also directed to issue notices to persons causing pollution and to file a compliance report. The court observed that the notices issued were not in compliance with its directions and directed the state to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to file an affidavit with complete details of the action taken by the government.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments from the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar and the recovery of penalties from those polluting the water meant for drinking. The Chief Engineer's compliance report was found to be lacking in complete details, and the District Collector was directed to appear before the tribunal with relevant information. The court also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that the original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not yet been decided. The court suggests that the tribunal has ample power to condone the delay and that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of this country. The court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State is free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters after December 31, 2016.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Srigangangar district and the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in Sriganganagar and Ganganagar. The court directed the State of Rajasthan to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The state was also directed to come out with comprehensive short-term and long-term schemes to render the canal and its distributories free of encroachments and consequent contamination within a given time frame. The court also directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief and discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.
