The National Green Tribunal in Chennai heard an appeal by R. Veeramani to set aside an environmental clearance order allowing the conversion of the newly constructed Tamil Nadu New Legislative Assembly Building into a multi-specialty super hospital. The appellant argued that the building was specifically cleared for the construction of a legislative assembly-cum-secretariat project and could not be used for any other purpose. The court heard arguments from various advocates and ultimately delivered a judgment on the matter.

The court order discusses the construction of a new Secretariat-cum-Legislative Assembly complex in two blocks, with Block A being the Assembly complex and Block B being the Secretariat building. The construction was completed and officially inaugurated in 2010, but the current Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu decided to move the government offices back to the old Fort St. George campus in 2011 for partisan political reasons. The appellant filed a writ petition challenging the decision to convert the Block A building into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital without obtaining environmental clearance. The 1st respondent raised preliminary objections to the maintainability of the appeal, arguing that the appellant had already raised identical grounds before the Madras High Court and was guilty of forum shopping. The court order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The court order discusses a case where the appellant repeatedly attempted to stall a political project through legal proceedings. The court found the appellant's arguments to be baseless and politically motivated. The court also noted that the project had already received clearance from the designated authority and that the appellant's challenge to this clearance was unsustainable. The court further explained that the government's decision to shift departments back to the Fort St. George premises was made in the interest of public welfare and that the building in question would be converted into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital. The court also addressed the appellant's concerns about the authority's power to issue a revised environmental clearance and found that the authority had the legal power to do so.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority of Karnataka has issued revised clearance for several projects, including a mixed-use development and a hotel and residential service apartment project. The Environmental Clearance given by the SEIAA is a statutory order by a legally constituted body by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The building proposed to be converted into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital has been designed and constructed for an imposed load of 4KN/Sq.m, which is very much above than the required imposed load of the hospital building as per the Bureau of Indian Standards. The present modification is in accordance with law, and the TNPC Board ensures that all the conditions stipulated at the time of grant of Environment Clearance and Consent to Establish are properly met.

The court order discusses the granting of consent by the TNPC Board for the establishment of a project under Water and Air Acts. The project proponent must apply for Consent to Operate once the project is completed, and the TNPC Board ensures that all conditions are met. The appellant is trying to prevent the establishment of a Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Modern Medical College, which is politically motivated and without merit. The State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) have granted Environmental Clearance for the project, which involves the conversion of an existing building into a hospital. The SEIAA is an independent body from the State Government and is responsible for granting Environmental Clearance for projects falling under Category B in the EIA Notification, 2006. The proposal was appraised by the SEAC and SEIAA, and the project proponent has met all necessary requirements.

The court order discusses the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) to a project involving a change in activity from a Legislative Assembly building to a Multi Super Specialty Hospital. The SEIAA, Tamil Nadu granted the EC subject to specified conditions and additional conditions. The court considers objections raised by advocates against the grant of EC and concludes that the appeal challenging the EC is maintainable. The court sets out points for determination, including whether the grant of EC is violative of law and whether the Environmental Notification 2006 permits conversion from the original scope of the project. The court also considers whether the appellant is an aggrieved person who can maintain the appeal under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The court order describes the construction of a Legislative Assembly-cum-Administrative office in Chennai, India, and the subsequent decision to repurpose Block A as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Block B as a new Government Medical College. The appellant filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Madras, which was closed with the condition that the appellant's representation should be looked into. The case was then brought to the National Green Tribunal, which considered the arguments of both sides and examined relevant sections of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court ultimately granted Environmental Clearance for the Multi Super Specialty Hospital.

The court order states that any application or appeal filed before the Tribunal under the NGT Act should be dealt with expeditiously and disposed of within six months. The Tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide environmental disputes and enforce legal rights related to the environment. The court also discusses whether the appellant has the right to file an appeal as an aggrieved person and concludes that he can maintain the appeal. The court also discusses the provisions of the NGT Act and whether the appeal is maintainable under Section 16(h) of the Act. The court concludes that the appeal is maintain
