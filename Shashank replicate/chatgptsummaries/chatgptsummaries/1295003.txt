The court order in question pertains to the interpretation of Section 72 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968, which provides for rule-making power. The court was tasked with determining whether the requirement to lay down a subordinate legislation before both Houses of the Legislature was mandatory or directory in nature. The court ultimately concluded that it was directory in nature and not mandatory.

The court also addressed the issue of licensee compliance with the Act. Specifically, the court noted that licensees are required to carry on their business in liquor that is free from all types of adulteration and fit for human consumption. This requirement is in line with the overarching goal of the Act, which is to regulate the sale and consumption of liquor in a manner that is safe for the public.

In addition to these findings, the court also concluded that the rule in question was directory in nature. This means that non-compliance with the rule would not necessarily vitiate the proceedings for suspension of the license. However, it is important to note that licensees are still expected to comply with the rule to the best of their ability.

Overall, the court order provides important guidance on the interpretation of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968. It underscores the importance of licensee compliance with the Act and the need to ensure that liquor sold to the public is safe for consumption. At the same time, the court recognizes that certain requirements under the Act may be directory in nature, rather than mandatory. This provides some flexibility for licensees while still maintaining the integrity of the regulatory framework.
