The court order pertains to a suit for mandatory injunction filed by Sh. Manoj Mittal against the Govt. of NCT Delhi and Managing Director of D.S.I.I.D.C Ltd. The plaintiff had applied for an industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries sponsored by the defendant no.1. The plaintiff's case was rejected for want of some documents issued from government departments showing that he is carrying on the manufacturing activities prior to 19.04.1996. The plaintiff deposited earnest money of Rs.60,000/\xad along with the application.

The plaintiff claimed that his unit was operating prior to the cut-off date of 19.04.1996 and furnished relevant documents to prove the same. However, the defendants argued that the plaintiff failed to furnish the required documents and his unit was not in existence at the given address on the date of application. The court heard both parties and found that the plaintiff's case was rejected as he failed to produce the required documents, and dismissed the suit.

The court also held that the suit was barred by limitation. The plaintiff had filed the suit on 22.07.2002, whereas the cause of action arose on 19.04.1996, which was more than six years prior to the filing of the suit. The court observed that the plaintiff had not explained the delay in filing the suit and had not shown any sufficient cause for condonation of delay.

The court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in the case of State of Haryana v. Raghubir Dayal, where it was held that the period of limitation for a suit for mandatory injunction commences from the date when the cause of action arises. The court also observed that the plaintiff had not sought any relief for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963.

In light of the above, the court dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiff. The court held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that his unit was operating at the given address prior to 19.04.1996 and that the suit was barred by limitation. The court also directed the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendants.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of producing relevant documents to prove the existence of a unit prior to the cut-off date in cases where the plaintiff is seeking an industrial plot under a relocation scheme. It also emphasizes the need to file a suit within the prescribed period of limitation and to seek relief for condonation of delay if there is a delay in filing the suit.
