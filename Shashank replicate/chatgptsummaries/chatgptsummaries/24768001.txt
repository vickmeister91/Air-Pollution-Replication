The first court order pertains to two petitions filed by Bharti Reality Limited and Mr. Rakesh Bharti Mittal seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them for violating the Environment Protection Act. The complaint alleged that the construction of a building was started without obtaining an Environmental Clearance Certificate. The court found that the certificate was obtained before the construction began and that the complaint was filed subsequently. The court disposed of both petitions and allowed the arguments to be raised during the trial.

The second court order approved the Scheme of Amalgamation under Section 391-394 of the Companies Act, 1956, merging M/s Mitbrau Realty Private Limited with M/s Bharti Realty Private Limited. The accused, including Mr. Rakesh Bharti Mittal, have been wrongly impleaded in Complaint No.42 of 2009, and the impugned summoning order has been passed without taking into consideration the material facts, which amounts to abuse of process of law. The court quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings arising therefrom.
