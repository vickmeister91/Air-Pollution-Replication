In a recent court order, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate issued an order to cease production activities in a paper mill due to pollution concerns. The paper mill had previously been given a No Objection Certificate by the Pollution Control Board and had been paying cess every year. However, the court ruled that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had the authority to issue the order under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that the Pollution Control Board did not have the power to close the industry for causing pollution.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had the power to take action to prevent public nuisance, and pollution was considered a public nuisance. The court also noted that the Pollution Control Board's role was to regulate and monitor pollution, but it did not have the power to close an industry for causing pollution.

The court directed the paper mill to obtain an appreciation certificate from the Pollution Control Board within six months. This certificate would indicate that the paper mill had taken steps to reduce pollution and was in compliance with the pollution control regulations. The court also granted six months' time to other industries to take steps for the discharge of effluents.

This court order has significant implications for industries that are causing pollution. It establishes that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate has the power to take action to prevent public nuisance, including pollution. It also clarifies that the Pollution Control Board's role is to regulate and monitor pollution, but it does not have the power to close an industry for causing pollution.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining an appreciation certificate from the Pollution Control Board. This certificate indicates that an industry has taken steps to reduce pollution and is in compliance with the pollution control regulations. Without this certificate, an industry may be at risk of being shut down by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.

Overall, this court order is a significant development in the regulation of pollution in India. It clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and the Pollution Control Board and emphasizes the importance of compliance with pollution control regulations. It also provides a framework for industries to take steps to reduce pollution and obtain the necessary certificates to continue their operations.
