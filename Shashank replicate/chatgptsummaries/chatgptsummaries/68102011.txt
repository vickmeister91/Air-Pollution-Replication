The court order in question relates to a case between Hershey India Private Limited and the state of Madhya Pradesh. The case centers around a notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The respondents' counsel has stated that this notice is going to be withdrawn.

The petitioners in the case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions, with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh, if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is a piece of legislation that seeks to conserve India's biological diversity. The Act establishes the National Biodiversity Authority, as well as state-level Biodiversity Boards. These bodies are responsible for implementing the provisions of the Act, which include the regulation of access to biological resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their use.

In this case, the Madhya Pradesh State Biodiversity Board had issued a notice to Hershey India Private Limited under Section 7 of the Act. This section requires any person or organization seeking to access biological resources for commercial or research purposes to obtain the prior approval of the Biodiversity Board.

Hershey India Private Limited had challenged the notice, arguing that it was not required to obtain the Board's approval as it was not seeking to access biological resources. The company claimed that it was only using certain plant extracts in its products, and that these extracts had been obtained from a third party supplier who had already obtained the necessary approvals.

The case had been ongoing for some time, with both sides presenting their arguments before the court. However, with the respondents' counsel now stating that the notice is going to be withdrawn, it appears that the matter has been resolved.

The petitioners in the case have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh, if needed. This means that they are free to file a fresh petition if they feel that their rights have been violated in any way. It is not clear whether they intend to do so at this time.

Overall, this court order represents a resolution to a dispute between Hershey India Private Limited and the Madhya Pradesh State Biodiversity Board. The notice issued by the Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is going to be withdrawn, and the petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh, if needed.
