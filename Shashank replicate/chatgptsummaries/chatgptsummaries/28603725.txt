The Kerala High Court recently heard a case (Crl.MC.No. 1266 of 2013) involving five accused individuals who were charged with offences under Sections 273, 328 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 59(iii) of the Food Safety & Standards Act. The case was registered after several people were admitted to hospitals in Thiruvananthapuram with complications after consuming food from the restaurant owned by the accused. One person died as a result. The accused filed a petition to quash the proceedings, arguing that they cannot be proceeded against under both the Indian Penal Code and the Food Safety and Standard Act. The Inspector of Police, Museum police station filed a statement in response.

The court order relates to a case where several people were infected with food poisoning after consuming shawarma from a hotel. Some were admitted to hospitals, and one person died. The accused were arrested and charged under various sections of the Food Safety and Standard Act and the Indian Penal Code. The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings, but the court rejected their plea. The court also discussed the applicability of the Food Safety and Standard Act and the Indian Penal Code in such cases.

The court order discusses a case where a restaurant owner and others were charged with violating the Food Safety and Standards Act and the Indian Penal Code after several people became ill from eating food sold at the restaurant. The prosecution argued that the two offenses were distinct and separate, while the defense argued that they were the same offense. The court ultimately found that the two offenses were different and allowed the prosecution to proceed with charges under both acts. The court also discussed the definitions and punishments for unsafe food under the Food Safety and Standards Act.

The court order discusses the effect of the repeal of certain enactments and orders, and the continuation of licenses issued under them. It also mentions the provisions of the Indian Penal Code related to the sale of adulterated or noxious food or drink, and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The order notes that if an act constitutes an offense under two or more enactments, the offender can be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those enactments, but not punished twice for the same offense. The order also discusses the question of whether a special law prevails over a general law in cases where both cover the same offense. The court cites previous cases to support the idea that a person cannot be prosecuted under both a general law and a special law for the same offense.

The court order states that the provisions regarding investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be applicable if they are overridden by the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (TOHO). The respondent has the power of an investigating agency but is prohibited from filing a police report under TOHO. The court also discusses the principles of implied repeal and repugnancy between statutes. The order cites various cases to support its arguments.

The court order states that the provisions of the Adulteration Act and the Fruit Order are supplementary and cumulative in their operation and can stand together. The court also mentions that if an act committed is an offense under two enactments, there is nothing barring for proceeding against them under two enactments but they cannot be sentenced for the same separately. The court also mentions that the offense under Section 59(3) of the Food Safety and Standard Act alone can be proceeded with by the Food Safety Officer as an empowered officer and other offenses which will not fall under that Act and persons against whom prosecution can be launched for the same offenses, who are not covered by the Food Safety and Standard Act, the only remedy available to the affected person is to move the police for regular investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure and proceed against them for the offense provided under the general law namely Indian Penal Code.

The court order (.732/2012) from the Museum police station in Thiruvananthapuram dismisses a petition that was claimed and declares it liable for dismissal. The petition is dismissed according to the judge, K. Ramakrishnan.
