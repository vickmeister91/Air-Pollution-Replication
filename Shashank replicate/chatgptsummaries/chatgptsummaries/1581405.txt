The Rajasthan High Court recently heard six petitions filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against orders passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Balotra in criminal cases pending before him. The cases were instituted on the basis of complaints filed on behalf of the Rajasthan State Board for Prevention and Control of Pollution, Jaipur alleging the commission of offences punishable under Sections 42 and 44 of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate discharged the accused-persons under Section 249 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 because the complainant was not present. The revision petitions were dismissed by the learned District & Sessions Judge, Balotra as he held that the offences under Sections 42 and 44 and the Act of 1974 were non-cognisable offences.

The only question which arose for decision was whether the offences under Sections 42 and 44 of the Act of 1974 are non-cognisable offences. The court held that the definitions given in clauses (c) and (1) of Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code make a distinction between an 'offence' and a 'case' and it is quite conceivable that in a given case the offence may not be cognisable but the case may be cognisable if the police officer is empowered according to the First Schedule or under any other law for the time being in force to make arrest without a warrant.

The court order discusses the issue of whether an offense is cognizable or non-cognizable based on the power of the police officer to make an arrest without a warrant. The court concludes that even if the power to make an arrest has been circumscribed by certain conditions, the offense will still be considered cognizable. The court also determines that the offense under Section 44 of the Act of 1974 is a cognizable offense and the orders of discharge passed by the lower courts are without jurisdiction. The court orders the cases to be proceeded with and decided in accordance with the law.

The court's decision is based on the interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court held that the definitions given in clauses (c) and (1) of Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code make a distinction between an 'offence' and a 'case'. The court also noted that the power of the police officer to make an arrest without a warrant is not the only factor that determines whether an offense is cognizable or non-cognizable. The court held that even if the power to make an arrest has been circumscribed by certain conditions, the offense will still be considered cognizable.

The court also determined that the offense under Section 44 of the Act of 1974 is a cognizable offense. Section 44 of the Act of 1974 deals with the power of the State Board to take samples of effluents and to analyze them. The court held that the offense under Section 44 is a cognizable offense because it involves the commission of an act that is harmful to the environment and public health. The court noted that the discharge of effluents into water bodies can have serious consequences for the environment and public health.

The court's decision has important implications for the enforcement of environmental laws in India. The court's interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 will make it easier for law enforcement agencies to prosecute offenders who violate environmental laws. The court's decision will also help to deter potential offenders from committing environmental crimes.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's decision in this case is an important development in the enforcement of environmental laws in India. The court's interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 will make it easier for law enforcement agencies to prosecute offenders who violate environmental laws. The court's decision will also help to deter potential offenders from committing environmental crimes. The court's decision is a step in the right direction towards protecting the environment and public health in India.
