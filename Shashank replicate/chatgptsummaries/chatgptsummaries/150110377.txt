The court order in question relates to a petition filed by K. Nagarajan, who sought to condone the delay of 122 days in filing a criminal revision against an order passed by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner claimed that he was suffering from jaundice and family problems, which prevented him from contacting his counsel and obtaining a copy of the order. However, the court found that the delay had not been satisfactorily explained and dismissed the petition, stating that lack of bona-fides attributable to a party praying for condonation of delay is a relevant and significant fact. Consequently, the criminal revision was rejected.

The case highlights the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for parties to provide satisfactory explanations for any delays. In this case, the petitioner's claims of illness and family problems were not deemed sufficient to justify the delay, and the court emphasized the need for parties to act in good faith when seeking condonation of delay.

The court's decision also underscores the significance of bona-fides in legal proceedings. Bona-fides refers to good faith or sincerity of intention, and lack of bona-fides can be a significant factor in determining the outcome of a case. In this case, the court found that the petitioner's lack of bona-fides in seeking condonation of delay was a relevant factor in its decision to reject the petition.

The court's ruling also highlights the importance of obtaining legal counsel and staying informed about the progress of legal proceedings. The petitioner's claim that he was unable to contact his counsel and obtain a copy of the order due to illness and family problems underscores the need for parties to take proactive steps to stay informed about their legal cases and to ensure that they have access to legal representation when needed.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of timely and diligent action in legal proceedings, as well as the need for parties to act in good faith and provide satisfactory explanations for any delays. It also underscores the significance of bona-fides in legal proceedings and the importance of obtaining legal counsel and staying informed about the progress of legal cases.
