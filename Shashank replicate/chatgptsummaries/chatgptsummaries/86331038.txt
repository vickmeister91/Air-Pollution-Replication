The court order in the case of Mohsim Ali vs State, dated July 22, 2014, pertains to multiple petitions filed by Mohsim Ali, represented by Mr. Avninder Singh, against the State, represented by Mr. P.K. Saxena. The case involves the challenge of the sentence in default of payment of fine, which ranged from one to six months in different cases. Mohsim Ali was sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000 for trading in endangered species of birds.

The court order lists the case numbers and parties involved in each petition but does not provide any further information about the case or the court's decision. However, it is clear that the court has considered the petitions and made a decision regarding the sentence in default of payment of fine.

The court reduces the sentence in default of payment of fine to the period already undergone by the petitioner, considering that he has completed his substantive sentence and has been in judicial custody since 2007. This means that Mohsim Ali is to be released immediately if not required in any other case.

It is important to note that trading in endangered species of birds is a serious offense and is punishable under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The act was enacted to protect wildlife and their habitats and to prevent their exploitation. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or trading of endangered species of birds and animals.

The court's decision to reduce the sentence in default of payment of fine may seem lenient, but it is important to consider the circumstances of the case. Mohsim Ali has already completed his substantive sentence and has been in judicial custody since 2007. The court may have taken into account his time served and the fact that he has been in custody for a long time.

It is also important to note that the court's decision does not condone the offense committed by Mohsim Ali. Trading in endangered species of birds is a serious offense and is punishable under the law. The court's decision only pertains to the sentence in default of payment of fine and does not affect the substantive sentence.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Mohsim Ali vs State, dated July 22, 2014, pertains to multiple petitions filed by Mohsim Ali challenging the sentence in default of payment of fine. The court reduces the sentence in default of payment of fine to the period already undergone by the petitioner, considering that he has completed his substantive sentence and has been in judicial custody since 2007.
