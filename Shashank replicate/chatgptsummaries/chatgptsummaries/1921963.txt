In a recent court order, the petitioner, Mohan Singh, challenged the rejection of his application to transfer his case from the Court of Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track) No. 2, Bharatpur to any other court in his division. The case involved the murder of his daughter, and the accused persons were being brought to court in handcuffs despite protests. The court ruled that the accused should not be brought to court in handcuffs unless they were extremely dangerous or likely to escape, and that the judiciary should be sensitive to the rights of prisoners and adhere to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

The court's decision was based on the principle that every person, including prisoners, has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. The court noted that the use of handcuffs in court can be humiliating and degrading, and can also prejudice the accused's right to a fair trial. The court also observed that the use of handcuffs should be limited to situations where there is a real risk of escape or violence, and that the decision to use handcuffs should be made on a case-by-case basis.

The court's ruling is significant because it emphasizes the importance of upholding the rights of prisoners and ensuring that they are treated with dignity and respect. The court's decision also highlights the need for the judiciary to be sensitive to the concerns of prisoners and to adhere to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

In addition to its ruling on the use of handcuffs in court, the court also directed the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) to ensure that a copy of the order was sent to all District Judges to bring to the notice of all Judicial Officers working in their division. This directive is important because it ensures that the court's ruling is disseminated widely and that all Judicial Officers are aware of the court's decision.

Overall, the court's order is a significant step towards ensuring that the rights of prisoners are protected and that they are treated with dignity and respect. The court's ruling on the use of handcuffs in court is an important reminder that the judiciary must be sensitive to the concerns of prisoners and must adhere to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The court's directive to send a copy of the order to all District Judges is also an important step towards ensuring that the court's ruling is implemented effectively and that all Judicial Officers are aware of the court's decision.
