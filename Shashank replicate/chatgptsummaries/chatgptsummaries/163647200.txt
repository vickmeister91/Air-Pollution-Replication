The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Md. Kalam seeking to quash an FIR filed against him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Wild Life Protection Act, and the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that the investigation was given to an Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) who was not competent to do so under the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the Officer-in-charge to conduct the investigation himself and quashed any investigation done by the ASI. The application was disposed of with this direction.

The Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act, 2005, prohibits the slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks in the state of Jharkhand. The act also prohibits the possession, transportation, and sale of beef. The act provides for punishment for contravention of its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Md. Kalam was accused of violating the provisions of the act by slaughtering a bovine animal. The FIR was filed against him under various sections of the IPC, including Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle), Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy).

The petitioner's counsel argued that the investigation was given to an ASI who was not competent to do so under the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act. The counsel contended that the investigation should have been conducted by an officer not below the rank of a Circle Inspector.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the Officer-in-charge to conduct the investigation himself and quashed any investigation done by the ASI. The court held that the investigation should be conducted by an officer not below the rank of a Circle Inspector, as per the provisions of the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the provisions of the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act and ensures that the investigation is conducted by a competent officer. The decision also highlights the importance of following the due process of law and ensuring that the investigation is conducted in a fair and impartial manner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Md. Kalam seeking to quash an FIR filed against him under various sections of the IPC, the Wild Life Protection Act, and the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act. The court directed the Officer-in-charge to conduct the investigation himself and quashed any investigation done by the ASI. The court's decision upholds the provisions of the Jharkhand Bovine Animal Prohibition of Slaughter Act and ensures that the investigation is conducted by a competent officer.
