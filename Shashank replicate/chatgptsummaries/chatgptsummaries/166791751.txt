In the first court order, the plaintiff had filed a suit seeking permanent injunction against the demolition of a covered area in his flat. However, the defendants had filed applications for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. The court rejected the plaintiff's prayer for injunction as he had already challenged the demolition order before the Ld. Appellate Tribunal, MCD and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was barred under the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. The court also noted that the plaintiff had already obtained the copy of the sanctioned plan and completion plan from the defendants, and hence, the prayer for direction to provide the same was already satisfied.

Moving on to the second court order, the plaintiff had sought to add additional prayers to their complaint against the Delhi Development Authority and a cooperative society. However, the court rejected the application as the amendments were in contravention of relevant laws and the plaintiff had not raised the issue of lacunas in their original complaint. The court allowed the defendants' application to reject the complaint.

In the third court order, the plaintiff's application to amend their suit seeking direction for the DDA to admit and consider their application for regularization of structural amendment without seeking NOC from the defendant no. 2 society was dismissed. The court stated that any dispute touching the management or business of the society shall be referred to the Registrar for decision and no court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of such a dispute. The relief sought by the plaintiff was against the bye-laws and the authority of society cannot be curtailed by allowing the plaintiff to bypass the rules and regulations. The court also cited guidelines from a previous case and found that the reliefs claimed by the plaintiff by way of an amendment are hit by Section 70 & 132 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act. The application of the plaintiff was dismissed.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following relevant laws and regulations when filing a suit or seeking relief from the court. It is also important to note that the jurisdiction of the court may be limited in certain cases, and disputes involving the management or business of a society may need to be referred to the Registrar for decision.
