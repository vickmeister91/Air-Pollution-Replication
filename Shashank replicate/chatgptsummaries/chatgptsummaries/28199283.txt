The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court recently heard a case where the petitioner, Pradeep Kumar, challenged an order passed by the Joint Director of Education, Lucknow, which cancelled his promotion as Assistant Clerk and directed an inquiry against the guilty officials. The petitioner argued that his promotion was valid as it fell under the promotion quota, while the respondents argued that the promotion was illegal as it was made against the direct recruitment quota.

The court found that the promotion was indeed made against the direct recruitment quota and upheld the impugned order. The court referred to previous judgments but found them distinguishable from the current case. The court also cited judgments stating that once a person is appointed on direct recruitment basis, their promotion should be treated as promotion and not direct recruitment.

The court further stated that it may not always be necessary to strike down an order passed in breach of natural justice if doing so would result in the restoration of another order passed earlier in favor of the petitioner. The writ petition was dismissed.
