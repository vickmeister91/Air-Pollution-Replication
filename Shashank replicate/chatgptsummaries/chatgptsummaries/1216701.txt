The court order in question pertains to a case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner, who is the accused in this case, had filed an application to call for the account papers from the complainant related to the alleged transaction. However, the court rejected this application, stating that unless the existence of debt or liability is disputed by the accused and the existence of account books/papers has been admitted by the complainant, calling for the same is not required.

The court's reasoning behind this decision is based on the fact that the accused has not disputed the existence of the debt or liability in question. Therefore, there is no need to call for the account papers from the complainant. The court also noted that the complainant has not admitted the existence of the account books/papers, which further supports the decision to reject the application.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on its finding that there was no abuse of the process of the court in the impugned order. This means that the court did not find any evidence of the petitioner attempting to misuse the legal system to gain an unfair advantage in the case.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing clear evidence to support any requests made in court. In this case, the accused was unable to provide sufficient evidence to justify the need for the account papers, and as a result, the court rejected the application. This decision serves as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to ensure that they have a strong case with clear evidence to support their claims.
