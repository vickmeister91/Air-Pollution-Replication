The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes between landlords and tenants over non-payment of rent and ownership of the property. In the first case, the landlord filed a case against the tenant for non-payment of rent. The landlord claimed to have purchased the property from the previous owner and that the tenant was inducted by the previous owner. However, the tenant denied this and claimed that the landlord's documents were forged. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and ultimately ruled in favor of the landlord, ordering the tenant to pay the arrears of rent.

In the second case, the dispute was over ownership of the property and payment of rent. The tenant challenged the landlord's ownership and claimed to have paid rent to a different person. However, the court found that the landlord had provided evidence of ownership and that the tenant had not proven their claims. The court also noted that the tenant had not provided evidence of rent payments and concluded that the tenant was in arrears of rent.

The third court order stated that the respondent had failed to prove payment of rent beyond the period admitted by the petitioner and was in arrears of rent at the time of legal demand notice. The respondent did not comply with the legal notice and failed to clear the arrears of rent within the stipulated time. Therefore, the petitioner was entitled to an order of eviction under section 14(1) (a) of the DRCA. The court directed the respondent to deposit the entire arrears of rent within one month and be heard separately on the point of granting the benefit of section 14(2) of the DRCA.

In all three cases, the court examined the evidence presented by both parties and made a ruling based on the evidence. In the first case, the court found that the landlord had provided sufficient evidence of ownership and that the tenant's claims of forgery were not proven. In the second case, the court found that the tenant had not provided evidence of rent payments and was therefore in arrears of rent. In the third case, the court found that the respondent had failed to comply with the legal notice and was in arrears of rent.

The court orders also highlight the importance of complying with legal notices and providing evidence to support claims. In the third case, the respondent's failure to comply with the legal notice resulted in an order of eviction. In the second case, the tenant's failure to provide evidence of rent payments resulted in a ruling that they were in arrears of rent. 

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder to both landlords and tenants to ensure that they have proper documentation and evidence to support their claims in disputes over rent and ownership of property. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences such as eviction or being found in arrears of rent.
