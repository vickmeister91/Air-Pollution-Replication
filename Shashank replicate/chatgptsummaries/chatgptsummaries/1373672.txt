In a case where the plaintiff had filed a suit for ejectment, recovery of arrears of rent and damages, the defendant/appellant filed an application for amendment of his written statement. However, the learned Additional District Judge rejected the application for amendment of the written statement, stating that Rule 17 of Order 6 had been totally omitted from the Code of Civil Procedure.

The defendant/appellant appealed against this decision, arguing that the learned Additional District Judge had erred in his interpretation of the law. The defendant/appellant contended that Rule 17 of Order 6 had not been omitted from the Code of Civil Procedure, but had been substituted by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1999 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002.

The court agreed with the defendant/appellant's argument and found that the learned Additional District Judge had indeed erred in his interpretation of the law. The court noted that Rule 17 of Order 6 had been substituted by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1999 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002, and therefore, the learned Additional District Judge's decision was erroneous.

The court set aside the order and remitted the application for amendment to the lower appellate court for decision afresh in accordance with law. This decision was based on the principle that a party should be given the opportunity to amend their pleadings if it is necessary for the proper determination of the issues in the case.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of a correct interpretation of the law. It also emphasizes the principle that a party should be given the opportunity to amend their pleadings if it is necessary for the proper determination of the issues in the case.
