The first court order pertains to a case where the State of Bihar lodged a complaint against three individuals for allegedly killing an elephant and removing its tusks in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and ordered the issue of process to the accused. However, before lodging the complaint, a case had also been registered against the accused with the police station for the same offence. The accused moved the High Court to quash the Magistrate's order, which the High Court granted. The State of Bihar appealed to the Supreme Court, which set aside the High Court's order and restored the Magistrate's order.

The Supreme Court held that the Magistrate had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence, and the police investigation did not affect this jurisdiction. The Court also clarified the meaning of "the same offence" and the scope of the High Court's power to quash proceedings. The Court stated that the term "same offence" refers to the same set of facts and not the same offence under different laws. The Court also held that the High Court's power to quash proceedings is limited to cases where no offence is constituted on the face of the complaint or accompanying papers.

In the second court order, a complaint was lodged against the respondents under Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and ordered the issue of process to the accused. The respondents moved the High Court to quash the order, alleging that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction. The High Court quashed the proceedings against the respondents on the grounds that the Magistrate acted contrary to the provisions of Section 210 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and that the complaint did not spell out the ingredients of the offence alleged.

However, the Supreme Court found that the High Court's approach and conclusion were unsupportable and that the complaint did indeed constitute an offence. The court also clarified that the High Court's jurisdiction to quash proceedings is limited to cases where no offence is constituted on the face of the complaint or accompanying papers.

The third court order describes a case where several individuals were accused of killing an elephant, which is protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972. The accused were seen entering a forest at night and returning in a jeep with the tusks of the elephant. One of the accused admitted to killing the elephant with the help of others and taking the tusks. The court rejected the argument that the offense was the same as one under the Indian Penal Code and allowed the case to proceed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court also discussed the principle of double jeopardy and how it applies to cases where the same set of facts can constitute offenses under different laws.

In the fourth court order of Na Reddy v. State of Madras, the court examined whether an article alleging corruption by a judicial officer was punishable under the Contempts of Courts Act. The court ruled that the act only excludes jurisdiction of the High Court in cases where the acts alleged to constitute contempt of a subordinate court are punishable as contempt under specific provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The court allowed the appeals and restored the order of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offense and ordering issue of summons to the respondents. The criminal case initiated on the complaint will now be proceeded with in accordance with the law.

In summary, these court orders deal with cases related to the Wild Life Protection Act and the Contempts of Courts Act. The Supreme Court clarified the meaning of "the same offence" and the scope of the High Court's power to quash proceedings. The court also discussed the principle of double jeopardy and how it applies to cases where the same set of facts can constitute offenses under different laws. The orders emphasize the importance of following due process and ensuring that complaints constitute an offence on the face of the complaint or accompanying papers.
