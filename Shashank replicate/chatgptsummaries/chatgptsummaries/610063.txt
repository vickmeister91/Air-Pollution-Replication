The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case involving violations of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court cited established principles that an appellate court should not interfere with a finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the decision is perverse. The court found that the trial court was justified in acquitting the accused and that no illegality or infirmity was committed in its findings. The appeal was dismissed.

The case involved allegations of violations of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The accused were charged with causing air pollution by operating a factory without obtaining the necessary consent from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The trial court had acquitted the accused, and the prosecution had appealed against this decision.

The Gujarat High Court, in its judgment, noted that the trial court had considered all the evidence on record and had come to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court observed that the trial court had taken into account the testimony of the witnesses, the documentary evidence, and the expert opinion of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court found that the trial court had applied the correct legal principles and had arrived at a reasoned decision.

The High Court also noted that the prosecution had not been able to show any illegality or infirmity in the findings of the trial court. The court observed that the prosecution had not been able to point out any material evidence that had been ignored or any legal principle that had been misapplied by the trial court. The court, therefore, found that the trial court's decision was not perverse or vitiated by manifest illegality.

The High Court, in its judgment, reiterated the well-established principle that an appellate court should not interfere with a finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the decision is perverse.

The court, therefore, found that there was no reason to interfere with the trial court's decision.

The court is in agreement with the ultimate conclusion and order of acquittal and dismisses the appeal. Bail bonds, if any, are cancelled and the record and proceedings are sent back to the trial court.
