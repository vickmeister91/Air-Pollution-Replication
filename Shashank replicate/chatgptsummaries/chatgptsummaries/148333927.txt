In 2000, a tragic incident occurred in Jammu & Kashmir where several members of the Sikh community were killed by unknown gunmen in Chatisinghpora. The accused, Wasim Ahmed and Mohd. Suhail Malik, were arrested and charged under various sections of the law. However, during the trial, the prosecution failed to produce any evidence linking the accused to the crime, and none of the witnesses were able to identify them as the perpetrators. As a result, the court found no incriminating evidence against the accused and acquitted them of all charges.

The case was transferred to the District Courts in Delhi by the Supreme Court in 2008. The court order states that there is no incriminating evidence against the accused persons in the case related to firing on several people in Chatisinghpora in 2000. None of the prosecution witnesses identified the accused as the offenders, and two other witnesses could not be traced. Therefore, the court orders that the accused persons be acquitted and released immediately.

The court also acknowledged the assistance of the defense lawyer and ordered that they be paid an honorarium of Rs. 15,000. This decision highlights the importance of a fair trial and the need for evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's decision to acquit the accused is a reminder that justice must be served based on facts and evidence, not on assumptions or prejudices.
