Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides for anticipatory bail, which means that a person can seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This provision is meant to protect the person from being arrested and detained in custody for a crime that he or she may not have committed. The court, while granting anticipatory bail, takes into consideration various factors such as the nature of the offence, the evidence against the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence.

In this case, the court has considered the nature of the offence, which is punishable under Sections 376(D) (E), 504 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code.
