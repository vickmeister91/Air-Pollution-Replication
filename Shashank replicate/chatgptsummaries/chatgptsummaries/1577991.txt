The Kerala High Court heard a public interest litigation filed by the Law Society of India against the Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd. The petitioner claimed that the operation of a 10,000 tonne Ammonia Storage Tank in Willingdon Island in Port Area posed a high potency danger to the environment and human life. The first respondent, a public sector undertaking engaged in the production of fertilisers, claimed that the tank was designed to maintain pressure at near atmospheric levels and was safer than high-pressure storage. The court ordered an investigation into the issue and did not pass an interim order to stop the loading or unloading of Ammonia. The petitioner sought the removal of the tank and a direction to the respondents to produce all records relating to the storage tanks.

The court passed interim orders to facilitate an investigation into the issues involved in the litigation regarding the storage of ammonia. The Port Trust suggested the resiling of the ammonia storage tank due to public sentiment against its use and potential threats to the security of the population. The Southern Naval Command also expressed concern about the potential hazards posed by the ammonia tank and recommended its immediate shifting to a safer location. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board filed a counter affidavit with detailed information on the issue.

The court order discusses the case of an ammonia tank in Willingdon Island, which is believed to pose a serious threat to Cochin and the naval base. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board has suggested removing the tank due to inadequate safety measures and the potential danger of a major leak. The Ministry of Environment and the State Government also support the idea of reducing or eliminating the storage of ammonia at the site. However, additional respondents, including employee associations, argue that there is no threat to human life and that decommissioning the plant would have negative economic consequences. The court acknowledges the potential impact of its decision but emphasizes the importance of addressing the potential danger posed by the tank.

The court order discusses the need to balance the economic benefits of hazardous industries with the potential risks to the community and environment. The case in question involves an ammonia storage tank that poses a significant danger to the community in the event of a leak or catastrophic failure. The court examines the physical properties of ammonia and the potential hazards associated with leaks. The tank's location near a naval command and airport runway further increases the risk. The court orders that necessary steps be taken to minimize the risk to the community, including locating hazardous industries in areas with little risk and implementing safety measures. The failure of the ammonia tank's foundation is also discussed, and remedial measures are sought.

The court order discusses the failure of the foundation of an ammonia tank and the remedial measures taken. The primary cause of the failure was the plastic failure of the inner piles, along with weak concrete, improper placement of reinforcement, and excessive positional deviation of piles. The responsibility for the failure lies with the piling company, M/s. Simplex. The rectification work was done under the supervision of the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), and their proposals were accepted for the repair work. The report suggests that the original pile load capacity was grossly overestimated, and only a few piles were tested. The most economical and least time-consuming solution was accepted for repairing the foundation, but it was not the safest. The report also suggests that the quality of workmanship on this job appears to have been of very poor quality.

The court order discusses the safety of a foundation for a tank storing hazardous material and the rectification work done on it. The court questions the certification given by the expert body on the safety of the foundation and the deviation from the original plan of testing. The court also appoints environmental experts to investigate the locational hazard and potent danger involved in the storage tank. The court emphasizes the importance of social justice and the need to overlook procedural laxity in representative proceedings.

The court order discusses three reports regarding the risk of catastrophic failure at a large-scale ammonia storage tank in a major urban area. The expert, Dr. Campbell, notes that operational characteristics and environmental criteria are irrelevant when assessing the risk of catastrophic failure. He suggests that the risk of catastrophic failure is beyond the capability of the company to control and proposes the production of ammonia at the fertiliser plant itself as the best solution. The report also discusses the soundness of the foundation of the tank and the corrosion of columns and beams due to inadequate cover and poor concrete. The IIT report notes seepage of water into pits near the center of the foundation but finds the flow to be small.

The court order discusses a report by an IIT team that found sea water seeping into the foundation of an ammonia storage tank, causing corrosion and deterioration of the concrete. The team recommended repairs and a protective coating to prevent further deterioration. The court questions the team's estimate of the tank's safe lifespan and notes a safety audit by Cremer & Warner that found the tank structure to be up to high standards but recommended improvements for safety in the event of a release. The audit identified 12 possible failure cases and noted corrosion as a major problem due to the salt-laden sea air. The report recommended measures to prevent further deterioration and improve safety.

The court order discusses a report by Cremer and Warner Ltd. regarding the design and operation of a plant. The report notes that corrosion from salt-laden sea air is a major problem and lists areas of advanced corrosion that require immediate attention. The company has taken remedial measures for these cases.
