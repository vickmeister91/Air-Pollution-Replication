A recent court order has been issued in a case filed under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused in this case were found to be in possession of 15 snakes, including pythons and cobras, without any legal documents authorizing them to keep these wild animals. The snakes were seized and handed over to wildlife officials, and the accused were arrested and produced before the court.

These sections deal with the prohibition of hunting, possession, and transportation of wild animals, as well as the penalties for violating these provisions. The court has found that there is sufficient material available on record to support the framing of charges against the accused.
