The Bombay High Court has issued a rule in response to two petitions challenging the validity of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2017. The concerned respondents have waived service, and the learned Attorney General of India has been issued notice, returnable on October 6, 2017. The court has also allowed an application for intervention in the case and directed the petitioners to carry out an amendment within a week. The Principal Rules were brought into force in 2000, and the challenge in this case is to the validity of the amendment made in 2017.

The court order outlines rules and regulations for controlling noise pollution. It specifies that noise levels in any area should not exceed ambient air quality standards, and the authority is responsible for enforcing noise pollution control measures. The use of loudspeakers and public address systems is restricted, and permission must be obtained from the authority. Violations of these rules can result in penalties. Complaints about excessive noise can be made to the authority, and they have the power to issue orders to prevent or control noise.

The court order requires that any order made by the authority must be rescinded, modified, or altered if an application is made by the applicant or original complainant. The authority must provide an opportunity for both parties to appear before it and show cause against the order. The court order also includes a schedule of ambient air quality standards in respect of noise and the impugned rules related to noise pollution regulation and control. The rules allow the state government to permit the use of loudspeakers or public address systems during limited cultural, religious, or festive occasions for a duration not exceeding fifteen days in a calendar year.

The court order allows for exemptions to noise pollution rules during cultural, religious, or festive occasions that do not exceed 15 days in a calendar year. The state government or district authority must specify in advance the number and details of the days on which the exemption will be applicable. The order also defines "festive occasion" to include national and state functions, such as Republic Day and Independence Day. The court order also references a previous judgment that established rules for silence zones around hospitals, educational institutions, and courts, including a ban on loudspeakers and public address systems in open spaces within the silence zones. The court notes that the impugned rules were enacted to take away the basis of the previous judgment, which has attained finality.

The court order prohibits the use of loudspeakers in silence zones as defined in the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, without a specific notification. The State Government challenged the order, but it was upheld by the Apex Court. The Principal Rules have been enacted to control and regulate noise pollution, which is considered air pollution under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court order emphasizes the right to life with human dignity and the right to prevent noise pollution from reaching one's home. The freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights, but they are not absolute, and nobody can claim the right to create noise pollution.

The court order states that excessive noise is a violation of the right to a peaceful and pollution-free life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court cites two previous decisions upholding this right and emphasizes the harmful effects of noise pollution on physical and psychological health. The court also states that no one has the right to make their voice or noise trespass into the ears or mind of others. The court rejects the argument that recent amendments to the rules have eliminated all silence zones in the state.

The court heard arguments from various parties regarding the legality of the impugned Rules, which were promulgated in the form of a notification on August 10, 2017. The petitioners and intervenors argued that the Rules violate fundamental rights under Article 21 and Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as they suffer from arbitrariness and do not establish any rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The intervenors also argued that the Rules are unconstitutional, being contrary to the provisions of the 1986 Act and 1986 Rules, and lead to manifest absurdity, absurd inconvenience, and anomaly.

The court order discusses submissions made regarding the impugned Rules and their alleged violation of the fundamental right to live peacefully and free from noise pollution. The intervenors argue that the amended Rules must be interpreted in a way that advances the scheme and purpose of the Principal Rules and avoids confusion and absurdity. The petitioners argue that the impugned Rules violate Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Additional Solicitor General of India argues that there is a presumption in favor of the constitutional validity of any legislation and that the Court should be slow in granting interim relief. The Government Pleader argues that the impugned Rules were made in accordance with the law and that the requirement of prior publication of the draft Rules was not necessary.

The court order discusses the amendment of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules in 2000, which dispensed with the requirement of prior publication of draft rules. The State Government issued a notification in 2009 authorizing local authorities to identify and declare silence zones. The court considers the power to grant a stay of operation of the impugned rules and cites previous court decisions on the matter. The court notes that there is a presumption of constitutionality in favor of legislation, but
