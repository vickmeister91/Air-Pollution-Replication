The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in a case filed by Rohit and another individual seeking the quashing of a criminal complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against them for burning stubble in violation of directions issued in April 2016. The petitioners argued that the complaint was barred under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

The court found that the complaint was indeed filed after the prescribed period and ordered it to be quashed, but only with respect to the petitioners. The court did not address other issues raised by the petitioners.

The case pertains to the burning of stubble, which is a common practice in the agricultural sector. However, it has been identified as a major contributor to air pollution, particularly in the northern states of India. In an effort to curb this practice, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board issued directions in April 2016 prohibiting the burning of stubble.

The petitioners were accused of violating these directions and were subsequently charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. They filed a petition seeking the quashing of the criminal complaint on the grounds that it was barred under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, lays down the time limit for taking cognizance of an offence. It states that any offence, other than those punishable with death, life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term exceeding three years, must be taken cognizance of within three years from the date on which the offence was committed.

The court found that the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was indeed filed after the prescribed period and therefore, was barred under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court ordered the complaint to be quashed, but only with respect to the petitioners.

The court did not address other issues raised by the petitioners, such as the validity of the directions issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board or the legality of the charges filed against them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to the time limit prescribed under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It also underscores the need for strict enforcement of laws and regulations aimed at curbing air pollution, particularly in the agricultural sector.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's judgment in the case filed by Rohit and another individual seeking the quashing of a criminal complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against them for burning stubble in violation of directions issued in April 2016, is a significant one. The court found that the complaint was indeed filed after the prescribed period and ordered it to be quashed, but only with respect to the petitioners. The judgment highlights the importance of adhering to the time limit prescribed under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and underscores the need for strict enforcement of laws and regulations aimed at curbing air pollution, particularly in the agricultural sector.
