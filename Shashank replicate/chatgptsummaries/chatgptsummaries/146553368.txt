The court order pertains to a dispute over the construction of a proposed road in Pune, India. The Nagrik Chetna Manch filed a public interest litigation challenging the decision of the Pune Municipal Corporation to construct a road through hills that have been successfully afforested by the Social Forestation Department of the State Government. The petitioner argued that the proposed road would require the cutting of more than 1000 grown-up trees and would lead to the deterioration of the environment in the city of Pune.

The court heard submissions on October 8, 2015, and pronounced judgment on January 15, 2016. The court's decision is not mentioned in this summary. However, the court order discusses the need for a final report from a Committee of Experts before the construction of a proposed road can proceed. The Municipal Corporation did not convene a meeting of the Committee, and the Municipal Commissioner appointed the Committee to ensure a proper study was made. The court also notes that the State Government did not approve the proposal for the road in the past, and a proper study is necessary to determine if the destruction of the forest for the road is in the public interest.

The court emphasizes the importance of preserving natural resources and ecosystems for public use and interest. The court order discusses the importance of protecting the environment and the duty of citizens to do so. It references the Forest Conservation Act and the Green Pune Project, and notes that while the forest in question may not strictly fall under the Act's definition, it is still a man-made forest that was afforested by the government. The court also cites Article 48A and 51A of the Constitution of India, which emphasize the protection and improvement of the environment and the duty of citizens to uphold these ideals. The court ultimately emphasizes the importance of preserving natural resources and protecting the environment.

The court found that the Pune Municipal Corporation did not consider the adverse effects on the man-made forest when proposing a road construction and did not fulfill its mandatory duty to protect the environment. The decision-making process was flawed due to the non-consideration of relevant factors and the Corporation's ignorance of constitutional mandates. Additionally, an interim report by a Committee of Experts revealed that necessary data was not available for the project and recommended that the PMC carry out necessary surveys to generate the required data. The Expert Committee recommended that the PMC appoint an institution to carry out the EIA for the project and employ a qualified and experienced consultant to carry out surveys.

The court order requires the appointment of a consultant with expertise in traffic, transportation, and finance to conduct surveys and studies to determine the necessity of a project and provide financial and economic analyses. The consultant must present their methodology to an expert committee before finalizing it, and the committee must continuously interact with the consultant. The PMC must ensure that the tasks are completed in a timely manner to avoid delays. The expert committee must submit its final report within 30 days of receiving reports from the consultant and NEERI. The committee unanimously recommended the termination of the contract with SERI for failing to deliver on the survey/study's basic objective.

The committee later decided not to recommend the construction of the proposed road after reviewing the modified report of SERI. The petitioner alleges that a revised report was uploaded to the PMC's website behind the committee's back, and the majority of the committee members did not recommend the construction of the proposed road. The interim report of the committee recommends that the Municipal Corporation consider the report of the project consultants and make recommendations accordingly.

The court order discusses a proposed road on Paud Phata Road to reduce congestion. The Road and Traffic Planning Department of the Municipal Corporation conducted a survey and designed the proposed road to ease traffic pressure. The court considered the location of the proposed road and the fact that it would require the removal of trees and plants. The court also noted that the area affected by the proposed road is a man-made forest, which will be adversely affected by the construction. The court considered the benefits of the proposed road and the potential harm to the environment.

The court order states that the proposed construction of a road through a forest will be set aside, but the Pune Municipal Corporation can invite recommendations from a committee of experts and make a fresh decision. The impact of the construction on the environment needs to be assessed before any decision is made. The impugned resolution is quashed and set aside, but the issue of reservation for the construction of the road in the revised Development Plan is kept open. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the court order highlights the importance of protecting the environment and preserving natural resources for public use and interest. The court found that the Pune Municipal Corporation did not fulfill its mandatory duty to protect the environment and did not consider the adverse effects on the man-made forest when proposing a road construction. The court ordered the appointment of a consultant with expertise in traffic, transportation, and finance to conduct surveys and studies to determine the necessity of a project and provide financial and economic analyses. The court set aside the proposed construction of a road through a forest and allowed the Pune Municipal Corporation to invite recommendations from a committee of experts and make a fresh decision after assessing the impact of the construction on the environment.
