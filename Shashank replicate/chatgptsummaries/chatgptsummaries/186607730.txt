The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Padmaram Bholaram Devashi under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for offences punishable under Sections 65 (E) and 81 of the Indian Penal Code. The court has allowed the application and ordered the applicant to be released on bail on certain conditions.

The first condition set by the court is that the applicant must execute a bond of Rs. 25,000. This is a common requirement in bail applications, as it serves as a guarantee that the accused will appear in court for their trial. If the accused fails to appear, the bond amount will be forfeited.

The second condition set by the court is that the applicant must surrender their passport. This condition is often imposed in cases where the accused is considered a flight risk. By surrendering their passport, the accused is prevented from leaving the country and evading trial.

The court has also warned that if any of the conditions are breached, appropriate action will be taken. This is a standard warning given in bail orders, as it serves as a reminder to the accused that they must comply with the conditions set by the court. If the accused fails to comply, their bail may be revoked and they may be taken back into custody.

It simply means that the court has deemed it appropriate to release the accused from custody while they await trial. The accused is still required to appear in court for their trial and must abide by the conditions set by the court.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Padmaram Bholaram Devashi under certain conditions, including executing a bond of Rs. 25,000 and surrendering their passport. The court has also warned that if any of the conditions are breached, appropriate action will be taken.
