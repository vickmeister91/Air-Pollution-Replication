The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is facing charges under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act). The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to secure certain documents from two banks, which was rejected by the learned JMFC (Judicial Magistrate First Class). The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the order and secure the documents.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the petitioner has a substantive right to get the documents procured by the court by issuance of necessary process under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. The court reserved the petitioner's right to apply to the trial court with an application under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. to summon witnesses or the documents. The trial court was directed to summon and issue process to secure such witness or document and enable the accused to use it either in cross-examination of prosecution or in his defense.

The court further directed that the proceedings in the trial court be stayed until the accused was granted two weeks' time to file the application. This order is significant as it upholds the right of the accused to access relevant documents and witnesses in their defense. It also ensures that the trial court follows due process and provides a fair trial to the accused.

Section 138 of the N.I. Act deals with the dishonor of a cheque for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The offense is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. The offense is considered a criminal offense and is tried by a court of law.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order production of documents or other things. It states that the court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C., order the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of such inquiry, trial or proceeding.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the inherent powers of the High Court. It states that nothing in the Cr.P.C. shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Cr.P.C., or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the procedure in summons cases. It states that in a summons case, the court shall, after taking cognizance of an offense, proceed to issue summons to the accused to appear before it on a specified date. The court may also issue summons to any witness who is required to give evidence or produce any document or other thing.

In this case, the court has upheld the right of the accused to access relevant documents and witnesses in their defense. This is a significant development as it ensures that the trial court follows due process and provides a fair trial to the accused. The court has also directed the trial court to summon and issue process to secure such witness or document and enable the accused to use it either in cross-examination of prosecution or in his defense.

The court has further directed that the proceedings in the trial court be stayed until the accused was granted two weeks' time to file the application. This ensures that the accused has sufficient time to prepare their defense and access relevant documents and witnesses.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is facing charges under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The court has upheld the right of the accused to access relevant documents and witnesses in their defense. The court has directed the trial court to summon and issue process to secure such witness or document and enable the accused to use it either in cross-examination of prosecution or in his defense. The court has further directed that the proceedings in the trial court be stayed until the accused was granted two weeks' time to file the application. This order ensures that the trial court follows due process and provides a fair trial to the accused.
