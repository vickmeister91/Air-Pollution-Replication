Deepak Chopra, a well-known spiritual guru and author, was accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by possessing three uncured leopard skins without a license or authority. The case was brought before the court, and the prosecution presented evidence and witnesses to prove their case. However, the defense argued that there were contradictions in the statements and that Chopra had been falsely implicated.

The court order pertains to this case, which ultimately resulted in Chopra's acquittal on December 10, 2012. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt due to contradictions in the testimony of witnesses and the lack of independent witnesses. As a result, Chopra was acquitted of the charges against him, and the bail bond was cancelled, surety discharged, and case property confiscated to the state.

The relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act were cited in the court order. The Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or killing of any wild animal, including leopards, without a license or authority. It also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any animal or its parts without a license or authority.

The punishment for violating the Act is severe, with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and with a fine which shall not be less than ten thousand rupees. In addition, any vehicle, weapon, trap, or other equipment used in the commission of the offense can be confiscated.

In the case against Chopra, the prosecution alleged that he had possessed three uncured leopard skins without a license or authority. The defense, however, argued that Chopra had been falsely implicated and that there were contradictions in the statements of the witnesses.

The court carefully considered the evidence presented by both sides and ultimately found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that there were contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses and that there were no independent witnesses to corroborate the prosecution's case.

As a result, Chopra was acquitted of the charges against him. The court also cancelled the bail bond, discharged the surety, and confiscated the case property to the state.

In conclusion, the court order in the case against Deepak Chopra highlights the importance of following the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The Act is designed to protect wild animals and plants and to prevent their illegal trade and exploitation. The court's decision to acquit Chopra underscores the need for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the importance of independent witnesses to corroborate the evidence presented.
