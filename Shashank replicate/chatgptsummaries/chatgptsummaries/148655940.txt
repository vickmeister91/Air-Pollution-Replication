In a recent court order, the case of Samaaru and Ramlal, who were in custody since November 2014 for allegedly killing a leopard by administering poison, was addressed. The applicants sought bail on the grounds that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that there was no evidence against them. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective.

The case of Samaaru and Ramlal has been ongoing since November 2014 when they were arrested for allegedly killing a leopard by administering poison. The applicants have been in custody since then, and they sought bail on the grounds that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that there was no evidence against them. The court considered their application and allowed them bail.

The court order directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This means that the applicants must provide a sum of money as a guarantee that they will appear in court for the trial. The surety bond is a guarantee provided by a third party that the applicants will appear in court. The court has specified that the bond must be to the satisfaction of the trial court, which means that the trial court must approve the bond before the applicants can be released on bail.

The court order is effective until the end of the trial, which means that the applicants will remain on bail until the trial is over. However, the court has also specified that in case of bail jump, the order shall become ineffective. This means that if the applicants fail to appear in court for the trial, the bail order will be cancelled, and they will be arrested again.

The court's decision to grant bail to Samaaru and Ramlal has been based on the fact that they are reputed citizens with no criminal past and that there is no evidence against them. This decision is in line with the principle of innocent until proven guilty, which is a fundamental principle of criminal law. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicants have been in custody for a long time, and it is in the interest of justice to grant them bail.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Samaaru and Ramlal has granted them bail on the grounds that they are reputed citizens with no criminal past and that there is no evidence against them. The court has directed them to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective. This decision is in line with the principle of innocent until proven guilty and is in the interest of justice.
