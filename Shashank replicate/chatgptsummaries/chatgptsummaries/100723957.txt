The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) against an order passed by the Appellate Authority allowing M/s Haryana Organics to operate its distillery unit for the year 2008-09. The HSPCB claimed that M/s Haryana Organics had failed to comply with the directions of the High Powered Committee and had violated the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Appellate Authority had quashed the HSPCB's order to forfeit a bank guarantee of Rs. 12.25 lacs, but the HSPCB challenged this decision in court. The case was transferred to the National Green Tribunal by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana.

The Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana issued an order on January 22, 2013, allowing a distillery to run under interim orders. The court heard arguments from both parties regarding the forfeiture of 25% of a bank guarantee by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and ultimately ruled that the HSPCB did not have the legal authority to demand or forfeit the bank guarantee without a mutual agreement between the parties or further directions from the three-member High Powered Committee appointed by the Apex Court. The court also noted that the purpose of the bank guarantee was to ensure compliance with the installation of a RO/Nano filtration system within a time frame specified by the HSPCB.

The court order discusses the powers of the State Board under the Water Act, including the power to enter premises and carry out inspections, grant consent to operate with conditions, review conditions, and issue directions to secure performance of its functions. The court also notes that the purpose of a bank guarantee is to secure compliance with mutually agreed terms and conditions, and that the HSPCB did not follow due procedure in forfeiting part of the bank guarantee without a specific term incorporated under any mutual agreement. The court ultimately dismisses the appeal and does not impose any costs on the appellant.
