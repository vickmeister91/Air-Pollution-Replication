In a recent court order, Raju S/O Shri Praveen @ Puddeena was granted bail after being charged with various offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that a co-accused in a similar situation had been granted bail by the court, and therefore, Raju should also be granted bail.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court allowed the bail application and directed the accused to furnish a personal bond and sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. This decision was made after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the nature of the offenses charged against the accused.

The granting of bail is a common practice in the Indian legal system, and it is done to ensure that the accused is not kept in custody for an extended period of time without trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused will appear in court for all hearings and will not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence.

In this case, the court found that Raju was not a flight risk and was unlikely to tamper with evidence. Therefore, the court granted him bail on the condition that he would appear in court for all hearings and cooperate with the investigation.

It is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that the accused is acquitted of the charges against them. It simply means that they are allowed to be released from custody until their trial begins. The trial will proceed as usual, and the accused will have to prove their innocence in court.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Raju S/O Shri Praveen @ Puddeena was based on the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the nature of the offenses charged against him. The court found that he was not a flight risk and was unlikely to tamper with evidence, and therefore, granted him bail on the condition that he would appear in court for all hearings and cooperate with the investigation.
