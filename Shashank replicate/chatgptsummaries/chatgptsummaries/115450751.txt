In a recent court order, the petitioner, Balvinderjeet Singh, filed a misc. application seeking recalling and review of a judgment passed by the court rejecting his petition for quashing an FIR registered against him under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court stated that a criminal court has no jurisdiction to recall an order passed by it except for rectifying an apparent arithmetic or clerical error. Therefore, the court dismissed the petitioner's application as it was not maintainable.

The case revolves around an FIR registered against Balvinderjeet Singh under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Singh had filed a petition seeking quashing of the FIR, which was rejected by the court. He then filed a misc. application seeking recalling and review of the judgment passed by the court.

The court, in its order, stated that a criminal court has no jurisdiction to recall an order passed by it except for rectifying an apparent arithmetic or clerical error. The court further explained that the power to review a judgment is not an inherent power of the court, but is a power conferred by statute. In this case, the court found that there was no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code or any other statute that allowed for the recalling and review of a judgment passed by a criminal court.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not pointed out any apparent arithmetic or clerical error in the judgment that needed to be rectified. Therefore, the court held that the petitioner's application was not maintainable and dismissed it.

This court order highlights the limitations of a criminal court's power to recall or review its own orders. The court's decision is based on the principle that once a judgment is passed, it cannot be recalled or reviewed except for rectifying an apparent arithmetic or clerical error. This principle is based on the idea that the finality of a judgment is important for the administration of justice.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of Balvinderjeet Singh highlights the limitations of a criminal court's power to recall or review its own orders. The court's decision is based on the principle that once a judgment is passed, it cannot be recalled or reviewed except for rectifying an apparent arithmetic or clerical error.
