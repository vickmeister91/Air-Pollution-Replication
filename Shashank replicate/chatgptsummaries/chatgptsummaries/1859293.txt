The Indian judiciary has been at the forefront of environmental protection and conservation in the country. In recent years, several court orders have been issued to protect the fragile ecosystems of the Himalayas and other regions. This article summarizes three such court orders that address issues related to tourism, waste management, and sustainable development.

The first court order discussed in this article was brought by residents of Garhwal, who were concerned about the invasion of state organizations and the erosion of the sanctity and peace of the bugiyal, which is a meadow and pasture land in the mountains. The court addressed three main issues: the establishment of a tourist hotel on the slopes of a bugiyal, the indiscriminate import of plastic and non-biodegradable material, and the littering of tourist and trekking pilgrimage routes. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and ecology and ordered the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam to remove its occupation of the bugiyal and to preserve the ecosystem. The court also suggested measures to prevent the dumping of non-biodegradable materials and open defecation on pilgrimage and trekking routes.

The second court order outlined measures to protect the environment and ecology of the Gangotri-Gomukh trekking route in the Himalayas. The order included regulating tea shops and kiosks, providing garbage bins and receptacles, spreading public conveniences, and discouraging the use of fossil fuels. The court also suggested adopting similar measures for other pilgrimage and trekking routes in the hills. The order emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and ecology, as mandated by the Constitution of India and supported by Supreme Court rulings.

The third court order stated that High Courts are responsible for ensuring the implementation of anti-pollution laws in their respective states, even in cases with national ramifications. The court also referred to the Brundland Report and the principles of Sustainable Development, Precautionary Principle, and Polluter Pays. The order directed a public sector state organization to withdraw from occupying a campsite and for hotels and tourist lodges to follow the precautionary principle. The Chief Conservator of Forests was to indicate specific sites for lodges in consultation with village Panchayats. Other remedial measures were to be carried out by various officials. The court appreciated the conduct of those involved in the proceedings and closed the case, but allowed for further redress if necessary.

These court orders highlight the importance of protecting the fragile ecosystems of the Himalayas and other regions in India. They also emphasize the need for sustainable development and responsible tourism practices. The orders provide a framework for regulating tourism activities, waste management, and other environmental issues. They also underscore the role of the judiciary in ensuring the implementation of environmental laws and policies. Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving the natural beauty and ecological diversity of India's mountains and other regions.
