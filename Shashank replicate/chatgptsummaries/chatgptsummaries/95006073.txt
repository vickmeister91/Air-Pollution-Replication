The court order summaries revolve around the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and its misuse by litigants for personal gain or political motives. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to ensure safety measures in all government public transport buses operated in the State of Tamil Nadu and provide adequate infrastructural facilities at the bus terminus and bus shelters. The petitioner raised issues related to the lack of left side wipers on the windscreen, obstruction of view due to stickers and posters on the windscreen, small and round rear view mirrors, poor working conditions for drivers in the cabin area, and the pathetic maintenance of Tiruvanmiyur bus terminus. The court considered the petitioner's representation and referred to judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court on public interest litigations. The court emphasized that public interest litigation should not be used for personal gain or political motives and must involve genuine public interest.

The second court order discusses the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and emphasizes the importance of ensuring that only those with genuine public interest and sufficient interest in the matter should be allowed to initiate PIL. The court warns against the abuse of PIL by those with personal gain or political motives and stresses the need for courts to filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs. The order also provides guidelines for the entertainment of PIL and cautions against the misuse of PIL for personal vendetta. The court emphasizes that PIL should be used as an effective weapon for delivering social justice to citizens and not for publicity or personal gain.

The third court order emphasizes that public interest litigation should only be used for the enforcement of fundamental rights of a group of people who are unable to do so themselves. It warns against the misuse of this jurisdiction for personal grudges or enmity, and discourages unscrupulous litigants from invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court for personal matters under the guise of public interest litigation. The court also stresses the need for careful examination of each case to ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive. The order highlights the abuse of public interest litigation, which has become a nuisance and is threatening to choke the dockets of the superior courts. The court urges the judiciary to be extremely careful in entertaining such petitions and to weed out frivolous ones.

The fourth court order discusses two separate cases. In the first case, the court allowed a writ petition filed by an Assistant Medical Officer of K.E.M. Hospital, Bombay, who alleged malpractices in the evaluation of answer sheets of the Post Graduate Medical Examinations held by the Bombay University. The court held that even though the petitioner had a private interest in the matter, the issue was of public importance and required investigation. In the second case, the court dismissed a writ petition filed as a public interest litigation regarding the maintenance of buses in Tamil Nadu. The court found that the issues raised were trivial and lacked public interest, and ordered the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 to the Juvenile Justice Fund.

In summary, the court orders emphasize the need for genuine public interest in PIL and caution against its misuse for personal gain or political motives. The court stresses the importance of careful examination of each case to ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive. The court also urges the judiciary to weed out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs. The court orders provide guidelines for the entertainment of PIL and highlight the abuse of PIL, which has become a nuisance and is threatening to choke the dockets of the superior courts.
