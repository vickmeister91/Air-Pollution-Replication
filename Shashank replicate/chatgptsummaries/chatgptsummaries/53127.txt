In a recent court order in India, the issue of whether the import of mammoth ivory falls under the ban on ivory trade imposed by the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was addressed. The court held that the ban on ivory trade applies to all types of ivory, not just elephant ivory, and that mammoth ivory cannot be distinguished from elephant ivory by the naked eye. This decision has significant implications for the trade of mammoth ivory in India.

The court also discussed the principles of interpreting statutes and the duty of the court to make sense of them, even if the language used is imprecise. The court emphasized that the aim should be to give effect to the intention of the legislature and avoid reducing the legislation to futility. The court may reject a narrow interpretation if it defeats the purpose of the law. These principles were applied in cases involving economic crimes and contraband.

The court order highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that gives effect to the intention of the legislature. The court emphasized that a strict construction of penal statutes may not always be given effect to and that a statute must be construed as a workable instrument. This means that the court must interpret the statute in a manner that makes it effective and workable, rather than interpreting it in a narrow and restrictive manner that defeats the purpose of the law.

The court's decision that the ban on ivory trade applies to all types of ivory, including mammoth ivory, is significant because it will have a major impact on the trade of mammoth ivory in India. Mammoth ivory is a valuable commodity, and its trade has been a source of controversy in recent years. The court's decision will make it more difficult for traders to import and sell mammoth ivory in India.

The court's discussion of the principles of interpreting statutes is also significant because it emphasizes the importance of giving effect to the intention of the legislature. The court's decision to reject a narrow interpretation of the law in cases involving economic crimes and contraband is also important because it shows that the court is willing to interpret the law in a manner that makes it effective and workable.

In conclusion, the recent court order in India regarding the import of mammoth ivory and the ban on ivory trade imposed by the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that gives effect to the intention of the legislature. The court's decision that the ban on ivory trade applies to all types of ivory, including mammoth ivory, will have a major impact on the trade of mammoth ivory in India. The court's discussion of the principles of interpreting statutes is also significant because it emphasizes the importance of giving effect to the intention of the legislature and interpreting the law in a manner that makes it effective and workable.
