The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a revision petition against a sweet shop for violating a notification banning the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags in certain places in Delhi. The shop was found to have stored and sold goods in plastic bags, and the respondents pleaded guilty to the offense. The trial court imposed a fine of Rs. 5000, which the petitioner argued was too lenient. The court modified the order and imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000, with Rs. 10,000 to be paid to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee as the cost of the proceedings. The court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with pollution laws and the need for heavy penalties for offenders.

In another case related to pollution, the court ordered the deposit of Rs. 20,000 within a week in the Trial Court, out of which Rs. 10,000 will be released to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee as the cost of the proceedings. The Revision file will be consigned to the Record Room and the Trial court record will be sent back to the concerned court along with a copy of the order.
