The Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Block's Manufactures Association filed a petition in the Madras High Court to make it mandatory for the Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation and its contractors to use fly ash bricks in their Melakottaiyur Project for the construction of 2673 flats. The petitioner cited a notification issued under the provisions of The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which mandates the use of fly ash bricks. However, the project in question had already been completed using chamber bricks, and the allottees had specifically requested the use of chamber bricks.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that the question of directing the sixth respondent to use fly ash bricks for those flats did not arise. The court observed that the petitioner had not approached the court at the appropriate time, and the project had already been completed. The court also noted that the allottees had specifically requested the use of chamber bricks, and the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the use of fly ash bricks would have been more beneficial.

The court further observed that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory in all cases, and it was up to the discretion of the authorities to decide whether to use fly ash bricks or not. The court also noted that the notification cited by the petitioner did not make it mandatory to use fly ash bricks in all cases, but only in cases where fly ash was available in the vicinity of the construction site.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the use of fly ash bricks would have been more cost-effective or environmentally friendly. The court noted that the use of fly ash bricks was not a panacea for all environmental problems, and it was important to consider the overall environmental impact of the construction project.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not approached the appropriate authorities before filing the petition. The court noted that the petitioner should have approached the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board or the Ministry of Environment and Forests before approaching the court.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court dismissed the petition filed by the Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Block's Manufactures Association, stating that the question of directing the sixth respondent to use fly ash bricks for those flats did not arise. The court observed that the petitioner had not approached the court at the appropriate time, and the project had already been completed. The court also noted that the allottees had specifically requested the use of chamber bricks, and the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the use of fly ash bricks would have been more beneficial. The court also observed that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory in all cases, and it was up to the discretion of the authorities to decide whether to use fly ash bricks or not.
