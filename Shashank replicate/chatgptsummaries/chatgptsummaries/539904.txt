The court order in question is related to a civil revision petition that arose from an order dated 19th April, 1978. The lower appellate court had previously held that the appeal was not affected by Section 4 (c) of the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956. The court clarified that only suits and proceedings related to the declaration of rights or interest in any land lying in the area where a notification has been made under Section 3 of the Act shall abate under Section 4 (c) of the Act.

The court further held that a suit for delivery of possession and mesne profits is maintainable if the plaintiffs have already obtained title on the basis of the sale certificate granted to the decree-holder. The court dismissed the petition without any costs.

The Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956, is a law that aims to consolidate land holdings and prevent fragmentation of agricultural land in Bihar. Section 3 of the Act empowers the state government to issue a notification for the consolidation of holdings in any area. Section 4 (c) of the Act deals with the abatement of suits and proceedings related to the declaration of rights or interest in any land lying in the area where a notification has been made under Section 3 of the Act.

The court's clarification on the scope of Section 4 (c) of the Act is significant as it limits the applicability of the provision to suits and proceedings related to the declaration of rights or interest in land lying in the area where a notification has been made under Section 3 of the Act. This means that other suits and proceedings related to land outside the area covered by the notification will not abate under Section 4 (c) of the Act.

The court's ruling on the maintainability of a suit for delivery of possession and mesne profits is also noteworthy. The court held that such a suit is maintainable if the plaintiffs have already obtained title on the basis of the sale certificate granted to the decree-holder. This means that if the plaintiffs have already obtained title to the land in question, they can file a suit for delivery of possession and mesne profits.

Overall, the court order provides important clarifications on the scope of Section 4 (c) of the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956, and the maintainability of suits for delivery of possession and mesne profits. The order is likely to have significant implications for land-related disputes in Bihar.
