The court order in question pertains to a petition challenging the validity of an order passed by the Chairman of the Haryana Pollution Control Board, directing closure of mining operations carried out by the petitioner for mining of minor mineral quarry in Villages Ramgarh/Sherifpur and Village Chandpura in district Ambala. The petitioner had challenged the validity of the order on the ground that the government had not properly notified the constitution of the Board and the Members comprising the same, as required under Sections 5 and 7 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, nor had the government appointed appellant authority as required under Section 31-A of the Act.

The petitioner had argued that the order passed by the Chairman of the Haryana Pollution Control Board was invalid and illegal as it was passed without jurisdiction and in violation of the principles of natural justice. The petitioner had also contended that the order was arbitrary and discriminatory as it had been passed without any basis or justification.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, disposed of the petition reserving liberty to the petitioner to seek "Consent to Operate" the unit mentioned earlier in accordance with the Act and the Rules on the subject. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to seek "Consent to Operate" the unit in question, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules.

The court observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the Act or the Rules, and therefore, it was not open to the petitioner to question the validity of the order passed by the Chairman of the Haryana Pollution Control Board on the ground that the government had not properly notified the constitution of the Board and the Members comprising the same, as required under Sections 5 and 7 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, nor had the government appointed appellant authority as required under Section 31-A of the Act.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the Act or the Rules, and therefore, it was not open to the petitioner to question the validity of the order passed by the Chairman of the Haryana Pollution Control Board on the ground that the order was arbitrary and discriminatory.

The court held that the petitioner was entitled to seek "Consent to Operate" the unit in question, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules.
