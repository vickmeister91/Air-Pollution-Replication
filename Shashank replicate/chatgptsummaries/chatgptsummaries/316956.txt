The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by the judgment-debtor No. 2, Shaikh Niamat, against a decision made by the Subordinate Judge in a partition decree case. The dispute arose when defendant 2 claimed that there had been an adjustment of the decree between himself and the plaintiff, Shaikh Jalil, which the latter denied. The Munsif believed defendant 2's story and made an order in his favor, which was appealed by the plaintiff.

The Subordinate Judge set aside the Munsif's order on the grounds that the application made by the judgment-debtor No. 2 was time-barred and fell within the provisions of Order 21, Rule 2, Civil P.C. This rule states that any adjustment of a decree must be certified or recorded by the court, and that any adjustment not so certified or recorded shall be void. The judgment-debtor No. 2 appealed this decision, arguing that Rule 2 only applied to money decrees.

The court dismissed the appeal, stating that the rule applied to every kind of decree and that the judgment-debtor could not ask the court to recognize any adjustment that had not been certified or recorded under the provisions of that rule. The court held that the Subordinate Judge was correct in setting aside the Munsif's order, as the adjustment claimed by the judgment-debtor No. 2 had not been certified or recorded by the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when seeking to adjust a decree. Any adjustment must be certified or recorded by the court, and any adjustment not so certified or recorded shall be void. This rule applies to all kinds of decrees, not just money decrees.

Furthermore, the court's decision emphasizes the importance of timely filing of applications. In this case, the judgment-debtor No. 2's application was time-barred, and therefore fell within the provisions of Order 21, Rule 2, Civil P.C. It is important for litigants to be aware of the relevant time limits for filing applications and other legal documents, as failure to do so can result in the dismissal of their case.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures and adhering to relevant time limits when seeking to adjust a decree. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of a case or the invalidation of any adjustments made outside of the court's certification or recording process.
