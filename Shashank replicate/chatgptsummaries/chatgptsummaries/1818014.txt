In 1989, the Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court of India, highlighting the environmental damage caused by chemical industrial plants in Bichhri village, Rajasthan. The plants, controlled by the same group of individuals, produced highly toxic effluents and sludge, polluting the earth, water, and air, and causing disease and death in the village and surrounding areas. The Rajasthan Pollution Control Board and the government of Rajasthan filed counter-affidavits, stating that the plants had violated environmental laws and regulations, and that they were responsible for the hazardous situation. 

The court ordered the plants to dispose of the hazardous waste in accordance with the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989, and held them accountable for the damage caused. The court order states that the State Government is aware of pollution caused by liquid effluents from Respondent Nos. 4 to 8 in Bichri village and surrounding areas. The pollution has made water in certain wells unfit for human and cattle consumption. The Ministry of Environment and Forests filed a counter stating that Silver Chemicals was never granted an industrial license and that Jyoti Chemicals never approached the government. The court ordered the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to study the situation and suggest remedial measures. The respondents were directed to remove the sludge and store it safely, but they did not comply.

The court order discusses the failure of the respondents to comply with the direction to store sludge in safe places, resulting in hazardous waste being spread all over the area. The court directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests to depute experts to inspect the area and suggest handling and disposal procedures. The court ultimately ordered the entombment of the sludge under the supervision of government officers. The court also directed the taking of samples of the entombed sludge and water from affected wells to determine the connection between the wastes and sludge resulting from the production of 'H' acid and pollution in the underground water. The report submitted by the experts revealed that the sludge inside the entombed pit was contaminated and that the groundwater was also contaminated due to the discharge of H-acid plant effluent and sludge/contaminated soil leachates. The report also revealed that the respondents had not properly disposed of the waste and that their other industrial units were operating without valid consents from the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board.

The court order discusses the contamination of soil due to waste disposal activities by Hindustan Agro Chemicals Limited. The court ordered the closure of the Sulphuric Acid Plant and the solvent extraction plant, including the oil refinery of the company, due to the discharge of highly toxic effluents. The NEERI report submitted in April 1994 revealed that the ground water and soil within 2 km from the plant were contaminated, and there was an urgent need to work out a decontamination strategy for the affected area. The report also mentioned the sludge and other industrial wastes generated during the manufacturing process of 'H' acid and the manner in which they were disposed of by the company. The report suggested remedial measures for decontamination of the affected area.

The court order discusses a report that highlights the urgent need for a decontamination strategy for an affected area due to reckless disposal activities by chemical companies. The report suggests various remedial measures, including decontamination of soil, water, and abandoned dump sites. The report also mentions the continuing discharge of effluents in an illegal and dangerous manner, causing harm to the environment and public welfare. The report suggests that compensation should be paid for the losses due to damage and the cost of restoring environmental quality. The court also ordered the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board to report on the latest position of the factories and the quantity of sludge lying in the area. The report submitted by the board revealed that two chemical units no longer exist, and Hindustan Agro-Chemicals Limited has seven industrial plants.

The court order discusses the findings of an inspection of Hindustan Agro-Chemicals Limited's seven industrial plants, which were found not operating on the day of inspection. The report mentions the presence of sludge mixed with soil in the area, and polluted water in wells and handpumps. The petitioner argues that the company is responsible for the pollution and should be closed down, while the respondents argue that they have been cooperating with the court and that the reports submitted by the authorities are suspect. The respondents also suggest a comprehensive judicial enquiry to find the causes of pollution and recommend remedial measures.

The court order states that the R.P.C.B. and other authorities should compensate for the losses suffered by the respondents due to their illegal and obstructionist policies. The court also discusses relevant statutory provisions related to protecting and improving the environment. The court rejects objections raised by Sri Bhat and asserts that it has the power to intervene and protect the fundamental right to life and liberty of citizens if an industry is established without obtaining the requisite permission and clearances and is run in disregard of the law. The court also affirms the validity of reports submitted by experts called by the court.

The court order states that the respondents cannot object to the reports of experts that were relied upon by the court in previous orders. The court found that Hindustan Zinc Limited was not responsible for the pollution in Bichhri village, but the respondents were responsible for the damage
