The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed an application filed by an industrial unit that manufactures CPC Blue (Alpha), a chemical product with potential for pollution. The unit had deposited Rs. 1 lakh with the Registry in August 1997 for external audit by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) under the Environmental Audit Scheme. The unit claimed a refund as NEERI had not come for personal inspection or taken samples. However, the Court held that NEERI had submitted a detailed report on the unit's environmental audit and was entitled to the fees. The Court dismissed the application and directed the Registry to pay the fees to NEERI.

The case highlights the importance of environmental audits and the role of regulatory bodies in ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. The Environmental Audit Scheme was introduced in India in 1992 to promote environmental management and sustainable development. Under the scheme, industrial units are required to conduct regular environmental audits and submit reports to regulatory bodies such as NEERI.

In this case, the industrial unit had deposited Rs. 1 lakh with the Registry for an external audit by NEERI. However, the unit claimed a refund as NEERI had not conducted a personal inspection or taken samples. The Court, however, held that NEERI had submitted a detailed report on the unit's environmental audit and was entitled to the fees. The Court's decision underscores the importance of submitting accurate and comprehensive environmental audit reports to regulatory bodies.

The case also highlights the potential for pollution from chemical products such as CPC Blue (Alpha). Chemical pollution is a major environmental concern in India, with many industrial units releasing hazardous chemicals into the air, water, and soil. The Environmental Audit Scheme is one of the measures introduced by the government to address this issue and promote sustainable development.

Overall, the Gujarat High Court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of environmental audits and the role of regulatory bodies in ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. It also highlights the need for industrial units to take responsibility for their environmental impact and to submit accurate and comprehensive environmental audit reports to regulatory bodies.
