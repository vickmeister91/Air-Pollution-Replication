The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case where the petitioner, Puran Mal Agrawal, had filed an application under Section 239 of the Cr.P.C. for discharge in Mango P.S. Case No. 72 of 2007. The petitioner had been accused of violating the Plastics Manufacture, Sale and Usage Rules, 1999, and committing an offense under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. 

The petitioner had argued that cognizance was taken in violation of Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, which bars cognizance of any offense under this Act except on a complaint made by the authorized person. The court found that the present case had been instituted on the basis of a police report, which could not be termed as a 'complaint' as defined under Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. 

The court observed that the term 'complaint' has been defined under Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. as any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under the Code, that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offense. The court further noted that the term 'complaint' has not been defined under the Environment (Protection) Act, and therefore, the definition under the Cr.P.C. would apply.

The court also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath, where it was held that the expression 'complaint' in Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act would mean a complaint made by the authorized person, and not a police report. The court observed that the present case was instituted on the basis of a police report, and therefore, the cognizance taken by the Magistrate was in violation of Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act.

The court further observed that the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act are special provisions, and they would prevail over the provisions of the Cr.P.C. in case of any inconsistency. The court noted that Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act is a special provision, which bars cognizance of any offense under this Act except on a complaint made by the authorized person. Therefore, the court held that the impugned order was set aside, and the petitioner was discharged.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case where the petitioner had filed an application for discharge on the ground that cognizance was taken in violation of Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act. The court found that the present case had been instituted on the basis of a police report, which could not be termed as a 'complaint' as defined under Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C. Therefore, the impugned order was set aside, and the petitioner was discharged. The court also observed that the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act are special provisions, and they would prevail over the provisions of the Cr.P.C. in case of any inconsistency.
