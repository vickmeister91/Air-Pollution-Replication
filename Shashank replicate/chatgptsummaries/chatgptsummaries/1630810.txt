The Delhi High Court recently heard a case where the Delhi Pollution Control Committee withdrew authorization and permission for industrial activity for various companies engaged in activities such as re-rolling, pickling, and annealing of stainless steel sheets. The companies argued that the withdrawal of licenses and permissions was violative of principles of natural justice. The court ruled that every administrative or executive order that affects or adversely impacts the rights of an individual should be preceded by a fair procedure, implying notice, a right to represent against the proposed action, and some opportunity of hearing.

The court ordered that the impugned order should be treated as a show cause notice, and the petitioner should file its reply within three days. The respondent Delhi Pollution Control Committee shall grant minimum opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and thereafter issue speaking orders. The entire process shall be completed within three weeks.

The case was brought before the Delhi High Court by various companies engaged in activities such as re-rolling, pickling, and annealing of stainless steel sheets. These companies had been granted authorization and permission for industrial activity by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. However, the Committee later withdrew these licenses and permissions, citing violations of environmental norms.

The companies argued that the withdrawal of licenses and permissions was violative of principles of natural justice. They contended that they were not given a fair opportunity to represent their case before the Committee took the decision to withdraw the licenses and permissions. They also argued that the Committee did not follow the due process of law while taking the decision.

The Delhi High Court, while hearing the case, observed that every administrative or executive order that affects or adversely impacts the rights of an individual should be preceded by a fair procedure. This fair procedure should include notice, a right to represent against the proposed action, and some opportunity of hearing. The court held that the withdrawal of licenses and permissions by the Committee without following this fair procedure was violative of principles of natural justice.

The court ordered that the impugned order should be treated as a show cause notice, and the petitioner should file its reply within three days. The respondent Delhi Pollution Control Committee shall grant minimum opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and thereafter issue speaking orders. The entire process shall be completed within three weeks.

The court's ruling in this case is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and due process of law. It ensures that individuals and companies are given a fair opportunity to represent their case before any administrative or executive order that affects their rights is passed. This ruling also emphasizes the importance of environmental norms and regulations, and the need to ensure that they are followed by all industries and businesses.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's ruling in this case is a welcome step towards ensuring that the principles of natural justice and due process of law are upheld in all administrative and executive orders. It also highlights the importance of environmental norms and regulations, and the need to ensure that they are followed by all industries and businesses. The court's order to complete the entire process within three weeks is a positive step towards ensuring a speedy resolution of the matter.
