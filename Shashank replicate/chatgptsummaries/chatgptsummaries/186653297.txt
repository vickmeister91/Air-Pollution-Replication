The court recently issued an order in response to a public interest litigation filed by Amar Singh. The petitioner sought a writ of Mandamus to restrain the use of loudspeakers in a park/temple in Lucknow. The court heard arguments from both the petitioner and the respondents, who cited a previous judgment in a similar case. After considering the arguments, the court disposed of the petition in accordance with the previous judgment.

The previous judgment directed the District Magistrate to give adequate publicity regarding the permissible limits of sound and to take action against offenders. The court reiterated this direction in the current case. The judgment also stated that no permission for DJ shall be granted, and all places of worship shall be bound by the provisions of the Noise Pollution Rules.

The court's decision is significant as it addresses the issue of noise pollution, which is a growing concern in urban areas. The use of loudspeakers in public places, especially in places of worship, has been a contentious issue for a long time. While some argue that it is a matter of religious freedom, others point out that it can cause disturbance to the public and affect their right to a peaceful environment.

The court's decision strikes a balance between these two concerns. It recognizes the importance of religious freedom but also acknowledges the need to protect the public from noise pollution. By directing the District Magistrate to take action against offenders and to give adequate publicity regarding the permissible limits of sound, the court has taken a step towards ensuring that the Noise Pollution Rules are enforced effectively.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of previous judgments in shaping the legal landscape. The court cited a previous judgment in a similar case and disposed of the petition in accordance with it. This shows that previous judgments have a significant impact on the legal system and can guide future decisions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive step towards addressing the issue of noise pollution. It recognizes the importance of religious freedom but also acknowledges the need to protect the public from disturbance. By directing the District Magistrate to take action against offenders and to give adequate publicity regarding the permissible limits of sound, the court has taken a step towards ensuring that the Noise Pollution Rules are enforced effectively.
