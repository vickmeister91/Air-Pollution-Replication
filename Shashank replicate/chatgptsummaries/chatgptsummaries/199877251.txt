In the first case, the petitioner, who runs a poultry farm, challenged an order by the State Pollution Control Board to immediately close his farm due to lack of prior consent and failure to comply with environmental protection laws. The petitioner claimed to have replied to the notice and that the order was issued without considering his response. The court found that the order was issued without considering the petitioner's response and violated the principle of audi alteram partem. The court allowed the petition and directed the Board to accord fresh consideration to the matter after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and another party.

The case highlights the importance of the principle of audi alteram partem, which means that no one should be condemned unheard. This principle is a fundamental principle of natural justice and is essential for ensuring fairness in administrative proceedings. In this case, the court found that the State Pollution Control Board had violated this principle by issuing the order without considering the petitioner's response. The court's decision to allow the petition and direct the Board to accord fresh consideration to the matter after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and another party is a significant step towards ensuring that the principle of audi alteram partem is upheld.

The second case involves an order for the petitioner to produce a copy of the order in the office of respondent No. 2 within four weeks. The petitioner has argued that their poultry farm is not an industrial plant and is not located in an air pollution control area. If the petitioner fails to produce the copy of the order within the stipulated time, the impugned dated 24.12.2014 shall be executed. The case has been disposed of.

This case highlights the importance of complying with court orders. The court has ordered the petitioner to produce a copy of the order in the office of respondent No. 2 within four weeks. Failure to comply with this order could result in the execution of the impugned dated 24.12.2014. It is essential for all parties to comply with court orders to ensure that justice is served and the rule of law is upheld.

In conclusion, both cases highlight the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice and complying with court orders. The court's decision to allow the petition in the first case and direct the Board to accord fresh consideration to the matter after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and another party is a significant step towards ensuring that the principle of audi alteram partem is upheld. The second case serves as a reminder that all parties must comply with court orders to ensure that justice is served and the rule of law is upheld.
