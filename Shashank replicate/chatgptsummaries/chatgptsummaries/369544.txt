The court order pertains to a creditor's petition to declare a debtor insolvent under the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act. The petitioning creditor claimed that the debtor owed them money and had committed an act of insolvency by having their property under attachment for 21 days prior to the filing of the petition. The debtor, however, resisted the application, claiming that the debt had been discharged and that the attachment was no longer valid.

The court found that the debt was due and owing and that the attachment was valid at the time of filing the petition. However, the court also considered the subsequent events, including the withdrawal of the execution petition, and concluded that the act of insolvency had lost its foundation and could not be relied upon to sustain the petition. The court emphasized that the rights of parties have to be determined as on the date of the commencement of the case, but this rule may give way in instances where subsequent events are relevant to prevent injustice or a mockery of the court's decision.

The court also discussed the discretion of the court to adjust the rights of parties based on events happening after the starting of the action. The court can take into account subsequent events to prevent grave injustice or to do substantial justice between the parties. In this case, the court considered the withdrawal of the execution petition and found that it was a subsequent event that had a bearing on the case.

The court also discussed the validity of an attachment in execution of a money decree and the setting aside of such an attachment. The court held that an attachment in execution of a money decree is valid if it is made in accordance with the law. However, if the attachment is made in contravention of the law, it can be set aside.

Ultimately, the court adjudicated the debtor as insolvent and fixed the advocates' fee for the petition at Rs. 250. The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts and the law, and it serves as an important reminder of the need to adhere to the legal requirements when seeking to declare a debtor insolvent. The court's emphasis on the importance of subsequent events in determining the rights of parties also highlights the need for parties to be vigilant and proactive in protecting their interests throughout the legal process.
