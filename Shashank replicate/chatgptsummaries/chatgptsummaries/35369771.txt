The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Morena in Complaint Case No. 3962/2006. The complaint was filed by the respondent against the applicant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of CrPC seeking the original records of loan account Nos. 19/14 and 3/18 to effectively cross-examine the complainant witnesses. 

The Magistrate had directed the respondent to produce the original records of both loan accounts, but the respondent did not comply. The Trial Court had found that the record of loan account No. 19/14 had already been destroyed and, therefore, no direction could be given for its production. The applicant challenged this order, and the court remanded the matter back to the Magistrate with directions to the respondent to produce all necessary documents to show that the record of loan account No. 19/14 was destroyed in accordance with the 'Document Handling & Retention Policy' formulated by Punjab & Sind Bank.
