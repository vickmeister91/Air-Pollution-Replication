The first court order pertains to an appeal filed by Ramesh Kumar and another against the General Manager of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and others. The issue raised in the appeal is whether a show cause notice was required to be issued to the appellants before recalling their selection for HP Gas Distributorship at Chandigarh in open category. The respondent Corporation had cancelled the candidature of the appellants for the distributorship as the land shown by them for the purpose of LPG Godown was already under acquisition process by the Finance Department of U.T. Chandigarh.

The court held that the principles of natural justice were not applicable in this case as the appellants had made a complete misrepresentation of facts and presented a lease deed to secure unfair benefit. The court also cited a previous case where an order could not be quashed on the ground of principles of natural justice as it would result in the revival of an illegal order. The court observed that the appellants had knowingly misrepresented the facts and presented a lease deed for a land that was already under acquisition process. The court held that the appellants had no right to be heard as they had acted in bad faith and had attempted to secure an unfair benefit.

The second court order discusses a case where the High Court refused to interfere with a government order that was passed without giving notice to representatives of a village. The court states that it is not always necessary to strike down an order passed in breach of natural justice principles, as doing so may result in restoring an earlier order that was also illegal. In this case, compliance with natural justice principles would result in restoring an illegal allotment letter, so the appeal is dismissed.

The court observed that the government order in question was passed without giving notice to the representatives of the village. The court noted that the order was passed in the interest of the public and was aimed at providing basic amenities to the residents of the village. The court held that the principles of natural justice were not applicable in this case as the order was passed in the interest of the public and was aimed at providing basic amenities to the residents of the village.

In both cases, the court has held that the principles of natural justice were not applicable as the orders were passed in the interest of the public and were aimed at providing basic amenities to the residents of the village. The court has also observed that compliance with natural justice principles would result in restoring an illegal order, which would not be in the interest of the public. The court has emphasized that the principles of natural justice should not be used to secure an unfair benefit or to misrepresent the facts. The court has held that the principles of natural justice should be applied in a balanced manner, taking into account the interests of all parties involved.
