The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Ajay Dubey challenging the appointment of respondent no.3 as Chairman of the Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had alleged that the appointment was made in violation of the rules and regulations governing the selection process for the position.

The court noted that the initial appointment of respondent no.3 was made after following due selection process and that the State Government had extended his tenure for another three years using powers available under section 5(7) of the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it.

The PIL had alleged that the appointment of respondent no.3 was made without following the due process of law and that the selection committee had not followed the guidelines laid down by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for the appointment of Chairpersons of State Pollution Control Boards. The petitioner had also alleged that the appointment was made in violation of the principles of natural justice and that the selection committee had not considered the objections raised by the petitioner.

The court, however, noted that the selection committee had followed the guidelines laid down by the NGT and that the objections raised by the petitioner had been duly considered. The court also noted that the appointment of respondent no.3 had been made after following due process of law and that the State Government had extended his tenure using powers available under section 5(7) of the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not been able to point out any specific instance of violation of the rules and regulations governing the selection process for the position of Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to establish any mala fide intention on the part of the selection committee or the State Government in making the appointment.

The court, therefore, found no merit in the petition and dismissed it. The court also observed that the State Pollution Control Board was an important institution responsible for ensuring the protection of the environment and that the appointment of a Chairman was a matter of great importance. The court, therefore, urged the State Government to ensure that the selection process for the position of Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board was transparent and in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the same.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has dismissed a PIL challenging the appointment of respondent no.3 as Chairman of the Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control Board. The court has noted that the appointment was made after following due process of law and that the State Government had extended his tenure using powers available under section 5(7) of the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court has also urged the State Government to ensure that the selection process for the position of Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board is transparent and in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the same.
