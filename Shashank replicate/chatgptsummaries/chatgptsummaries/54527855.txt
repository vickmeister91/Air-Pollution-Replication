The court order in question pertains to a criminal case involving the owner of a lorry who is accused of violating forest and wildlife protection laws by digging a bore well in a reserve forest area. The petitioner in the case had sought interim custody of the vehicle, which was granted by the court below, subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee/FD for the amount of Rs.50,00,000/-. 

The petitioner challenged the conditions imposed by the court below, which were deemed to be onerous, and the court modified the conditions by directing the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.50,000/- and execute a bond for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- with two sureties for the same amount. The original RC book of the vehicle was to be surrendered, and the certified copy of the RC book of the vehicle was to be released to the petitioner. 

The court also made it clear that certain conditions would continue to be in force and that the vehicle should not commit any other identical offence, failing which the interim custody order would be cancelled. This decision by the court is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting forest and wildlife areas, and the consequences of violating laws related to their protection. 

The case also sheds light on the legal process involved in seeking interim custody of a vehicle in a criminal case. The petitioner in this case had to provide a bank guarantee or FD for a large sum of money, which was deemed to be onerous by the court. The court modified the conditions to make them more reasonable, requiring the petitioner to deposit a smaller sum of money and execute a bond with sureties. 

This decision by the court is likely to have implications for future cases involving the violation of forest and wildlife protection laws. It sends a message that such violations will not be taken lightly and that those responsible will be held accountable. 

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting our natural resources and the legal process involved in seeking interim custody of a vehicle in a criminal case. It also highlights the role of the court in ensuring that justice is served and that the law is upheld.
