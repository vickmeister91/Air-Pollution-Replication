The Gujarat High Court received a petition to quash proceedings in Criminal Case No.6 of 1990 pending in the Court of the learned 5th Joint Judicial Magistrate, First Class at Bhavnagar. The case involves allegations of violations of the provisions of Sections 24 and 25 punishable under Sections 43 and 44 read with Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners, who are directors of the accused No.1 company, argue that the allegations contained in the complaint did not disclose any offense and did not connect them with any offense.

The court examines the provisions of Section 47 of the Act and the liability of directors and officers of a company for offenses committed by the company. The court also cites several judgments to support the argument that the burden of proving that the accused were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company lies on the prosecution.

The court order discusses a case under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, where the petitioners, who were directors of a company, were accused of an offense committed by the company. The petitioners argued that the complaint did not disclose their role in the offense and that they could not be held vicariously liable without evidence of their consent, connivance, or neglect. The respondent argued that the complaint did implicate the petitioners and that they could be held liable under Section 47 of the Act.

The court examined relevant case law and concluded that the petitioners could be held liable if it was proved that they were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business and that the offense was committed with their consent, connivance, or neglect. The court also noted that the complaint should disclose the necessary material facts to implicate the accused in the offense.

The High Court set aside a previous court order and restored the Chief Judicial Magistrate's order to proceed with the trial as quickly as possible. The petitioners attempted to distinguish this judgment, but the court found that there was enough material in the complaint to implicate them and that the case should proceed to a full-fledged trial. The court rejected the application to quash the proceedings and cautioned that the power to do so should be exercised sparingly. The court also granted a four-week stay on the implementation of the order.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the liability of directors and officers of a company for offenses committed by the company. The court's interpretation of Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, makes it clear that directors and officers can be held liable if it is proved that they were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business and that the offense was committed with their consent, connivance, or neglect.

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that complaints disclose the necessary material facts to implicate the accused in the offense. This is particularly important in cases where directors and officers of a company are accused of an offense committed by the company.
