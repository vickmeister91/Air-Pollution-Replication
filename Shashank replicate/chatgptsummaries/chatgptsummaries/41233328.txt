The court order pertains to a case in Bihar where the legality and validity of training certificates of Assistant Teachers appointed under the 2010 Special Recruitment Rules were being questioned. The petitioners argued that once appointed, they cannot be terminated on the basis of verification of their certificates. However, the court held that the authorities have the right to examine the legality, validity, and genuineness of the certificates. The court also discussed the principle of natural justice and held that it is not a strict formula and depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

The court order discusses the "useless formality theory" and the importance of natural justice. Various legal experts have different opinions on the matter, but the court does not express any opinion on it. The court also states that relief may be refused if it would be in vain or not in the public interest. In the specific case at hand, the court finds no justification to interfere with the order as granting a hearing would be futile. The court cites a previous judgment in support of this decision.

In another case, the court has dismissed a writ petition based on the fact that they do not find any merit in the arguments presented by the petitioners, citing previous judgments as support. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners failed to provide any evidence to support their claims. The court also held that the petitioners did not have a legal right to the relief sought.

The court's decision in the first case is significant as it clarifies the authority of the authorities to examine the legality, validity, and genuineness of certificates. The court's discussion of the principle of natural justice is also noteworthy as it highlights the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case. The court's decision in the second case reinforces the importance of providing evidence to support claims and having a legal right to the relief sought.

Overall, the court's orders emphasize the importance of following due process and providing evidence to support claims. The court's discussion of natural justice highlights the need to consider the facts and circumstances of each case and not rely on strict formulas. These principles are essential to ensuring fairness and justice in legal proceedings.
