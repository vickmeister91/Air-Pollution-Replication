The Indian legal system has long been grappling with the issue of the rights of victims in criminal proceedings. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, has been the subject of much debate and interpretation, particularly with regard to the right of victims to appeal against orders of acquittal. This article consolidates several court orders that discuss various aspects related to the rights of victims in criminal justice systems.

One court order discusses the ambiguity surrounding the right to appeal for victims of a crime under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court refers to previous cases and conflicting opinions on whether the term "victim" includes the complainant and whether the right to appeal is a right or obligation of the state. The court formulates seven questions for consideration, including the true meaning of the term "victim" and where the appeal of a victim would lie if the state also appeals against the order of acquittal.

Another court order discusses various aspects related to the rights of victims in criminal justice systems. It includes international perspectives on victim rights, legislative history in India, and landmark cases that have built up victim's rights in India. The order also addresses specific questions related to the CrPC, including the retrospective or prospective nature of a proviso to Section 372 and the period of limitation for a victim to prefer an appeal. Overall, the order emphasizes the need to recognize and protect the rights of victims in criminal proceedings.

The Supreme Court has recognized the right of a complainant to be heard by the High Court in proceedings initiated by the accused for quashing those proceedings. The court has also recognized the right of the victim, including the locus standi of his/her family members, to appeal against acquittal in the broadest sense. However, the legislature did not permit a victim to appeal against the acquittal of his wrong-doer even while carrying out sweeping amendments in the Code in the year 2005.

Another court order discusses the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2008, which includes the right of a victim to appeal against an order of acquittal or conviction for a lesser offense or inadequate compensation. The definition of a victim is also discussed, which includes a person who has suffered loss or injury due to the act or omission of the offender. The court also notes that there is a need for harmonious interpretation of the amended and unamended provisions of the Code.

The court order discusses the definition of a victim as someone who has suffered loss or injury due to the actions of an offender, including their guardian or legal heir. The United Nations has recognized the need for national and international norms to protect the rights of victims of crime and abuse of power. The court also discusses various cases where the definition of a victim and their legal heirs have been debated, with different courts having different opinions. Ultimately, the court concludes that the complainant in the case is not a victim and therefore cannot appeal under Section 372 of the Code.

The court order discusses the lack of unanimity on the definition of "legal heirs" of a victim for the purpose of locus to appeal under proviso to Section 372. The court concludes that every heir who, in law, is entitled to succeed to the estate of a deceased victim in one or the other eventuality, shall fall within the ambit of Section 2(wa) of the Code. The court also discusses the different categories of eligible persons who are entitled to be compensated under Section 357(1)(c) or Section 357-A of the Code, in the case of the death of a victim.

The court order discusses the eligibility of different categories of persons for compensation under Section 357(1)(c) or Section 357-A of the Code in the case of the death of a victim. The court clarifies that the compensation is not limited to legal heirs of the deceased victim and can be claimed by any dependent who requires rehabilitation. The court also discusses the right of a victim or their legal heirs to engage an advocate or prefer an appeal under proviso to Section 372 of the Code. The court concludes that all legal heirs, irrespective of their classification under personal law, can prefer an appeal under proviso to Section 372. The court suggests that procedural difficulties arising from multiple appeals can be streamlined by the Appellate Court through appropriate rules or instructions. The court recognizes the rights of victims and their legal heirs to compensation and appeal under the Code.

The court order discusses the eligibility of dependents of a victim to seek compensation under Section 357-A of the Code in case of the victim's death. It also addresses the issue of whether a complainant who is also a victim in a private complaint-case is entitled to present an appeal against the order of acquittal under proviso to Section 372 or has to seek 'special leave' to appeal from the High Court under Section 378(4) CrPC. The court notes that different conditions for the maintainability of appeal against order of acquittal passed in a 'police-case' vis-Ã -vis a 'complaint-case' have been prescribed by the legislature. The court also discusses the different interpretations of the terms 'victim' and 'complainant' in the Code and the stringent conditions imposed on the maintainability of appeal against an order of acquittal in a complaint-case.
