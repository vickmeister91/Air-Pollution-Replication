Tulaiya Ahirwar, who had been in custody since February 25, 2018, for allegedly hunting wild boar illegally, has been granted bail by the court. The court has ordered him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his presence during the trial and comply with the conditions mentioned in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The case against Ahirwar was registered under Section 9/51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959. The prosecution had alleged that Ahirwar was found in possession of a .315 bore rifle and ammunition without a valid license. The prosecution had also alleged that Ahirwar had hunted a wild boar illegally.

Ahirwar had moved a bail application before the court, which was opposed by the prosecution. The prosecution had argued that Ahirwar was a habitual offender and had been involved in several cases of wildlife crime in the past. The prosecution had also argued that Ahirwar was likely to abscond if released on bail.

The court observed that the allegations against Ahirwar were not of a serious nature and that he had been in custody for a considerable period of time.

The court, while granting bail to Ahirwar, imposed certain conditions on him. Ahirwar was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. He was also ordered to cooperate with the investigation and attend the court on all the dates fixed for the trial. Ahirwar was further ordered not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

The court also directed Ahirwar to surrender his passport, if any, and not to leave the country without the permission of the court. The court further directed Ahirwar to report to the investigating officer once a week until the trial is concluded.
