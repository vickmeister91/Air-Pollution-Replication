The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and its various amendments. The Act was enacted to protect wild animals, birds, and plants, and the Indian elephant was brought under its purview in 1977. In 1991, a total prohibition on trade of imported ivory was imposed, and the Act was brought into force in 1992. The court orders address the constitutionality and validity of the Act and its amendments, as well as the penalties for violating the Act.

In one case, the Indian Handicrafts Emporium and others were engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling articles made from ivory imported from African countries. The appellants filed writ petitions questioning the constitutionality and validity of the 1991 Amendment Act prohibiting trade in imported ivory. The High Court upheld the vires of the Act, and the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment. In another case, the court discusses the constitutionality of the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2003, which bans the possession of ivory in India. The court cites previous cases and constitutional provisions to argue that the protection and preservation of wildlife is in the public interest and that the ban on ivory trade is a reasonable restriction.

The court also notes that India is not obligated to make laws only in accordance with international treaties and conventions and that the ban on ivory trade is necessary to prevent poaching and illegal trade. The court rejects the argument that the Amending Acts provide for arbitrary power. In another case, the court upholds the constitutionality of the Amending Acts that prohibit trade in ivory and animal articles. The court rejects the argument that the definition of wild animal is vague and that the Amending Acts provide arbitrary power. The court also states that the doctrine of 'res extra commercium' cannot be invoked in this case.

The court orders that the appellants, who are traders, must declare their stocks in accordance with Section 49-C of the Act. In another case, the court discusses the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act in relation to the possession and trade of ivory imported into India. It states that while trade or commerce in ivory is completely prohibited, a person carrying on a business or occupation dealing in trophies, animal articles, etc. derived from scheduled animals is entitled to file a declaration disclosing their stocks of ivory imported into India or articles made therefrom.

If a person makes a declaration expressing their desire to retain with themselves any of the items specified therein for their bona fide use, a certificate of ownership may be granted for such item or items. The court also discusses the issue of whether ivory vests in the government and concludes that the question of whether an offence under the Act has been committed or not cannot be determined at that stage and must be adjudicated by a competent court of law. The court emphasizes the need to read all the provisions of the Act in their entirety and apply principles of purposive construction to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and phrases employed.

In another case, the court discusses the limited scope of judicial review in administrative action, the applicability of the doctrine of proportionality in administrative law, and the importance of interpreting statutes in context. The court also applies the doctrine of purposive construction to a case involving possession of animal articles, concluding that the appellants have no right to possess the articles in question and that compensation is not necessary. The court does not find the provisions of the amending act to be violative of the right of property of the appellants.

In the final case, the court states that the appellants have no right to possess the articles in question and that the provisions of the statute are not violative of the right of property of the appellants. The court also states that the guidelines issued by the Central Government do not meet the requirements of the law and cannot be given effect to. The respondents are entitled to take physical possession of the ivory now in seizure, but the articles including idols of gods and goddesses and household items like sofa sets depicting cultural and religious heritage should not be destroyed and should be kept at appropriate museums or suitable places. The appeals and writ petition are dismissed.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and its various amendments. The court upholds the constitutionality and validity of the Act and its amendments, and emphasizes the importance of protecting wild animals and the environment. The court also addresses the penalties for violating the Act and the need to read all the provisions of the Act in their entirety and apply principles of purposive construction to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and phrases employed.
