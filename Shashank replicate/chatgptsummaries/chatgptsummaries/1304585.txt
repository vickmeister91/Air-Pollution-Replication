The Kerala High Court recently heard several writ petitions related to the establishment of a burning ground in Manathala Village by the Chavakkad Municipality. The controversy began in 1994 when the Municipality obtained clearance from the District Collector to establish a burning and burial ground in the area. However, some residents filed a suit against the Municipality, which was dismissed by the Munsiff's Court, Chavakkad, subject to certain conditions. The plaintiffs appealed to the District Court, Trissur, which was also dismissed. The matter was then taken to the Kerala High Court.

The petitioners in the case argued that the site was not suitable for a burning ground, and that the Municipality had not complied with the requirements of Section 484 of the Municipalities Act. The Government overruled the objections raised by the petitioners and allowed the Municipality to establish a burning bed (gas-fired crematorium) in the site. The petitioners challenged this decision in court.

The court order discusses a petition against the establishment of a cremation ground in Chavakkad Municipality. The government argues that it is necessary to have a crematorium in the municipality to prevent poor families from burying their dead in their homes. The petitioners argue that there are other burial grounds nearby and that the proposed site is not suitable. The court finds that the site was suitable according to a report from 1994 and that the necessary approvals have been obtained. The contention that the burial ground will pollute fresh water sources is also dismissed.

The court order states that the concerned authorities have given consent for the establishment of an LPG fired crematorium, and that the municipality has obtained statutory clearances from the Pollution Control Board and the Government. The court also notes that there are no residential houses or water sources within a radius of 50 meters from the proposed site, and that the rules and regulations connected with the opening of a burning ground have been observed. The court rejects the contention that any relevant aspect has been omitted or that any irrelevant material has entered into the consideration of the Government. The court also dismisses the plea of violation of principles of natural justice, as there is no evidence of prejudice. Finally, the court considers whether the requirements of Section 484 of the Municipalities Act are to be complied with when a Municipality establishes a burning ground.

The court order discusses the requirements for obtaining a license to establish a burning ground or crematorium under the Municipalities Act. It states that if a municipality is providing a burning ground within its own area, the question of a license does not apply, but procedural formalities must still be followed to ensure public interest is safeguarded. The court also notes that the statutorily prescribed distance for establishing crematoria or burial grounds from residential premises is 50 meters, and in this case, there were no houses or huts within 97.4 meters of the site. The court rejects the petitioner's objections based on reports submitted by the District Medical Officer, as they were not relevant to the suitability of the site for an LPG gas-fired crematorium.

The court order bans the burning of any material on the beaches in the State. The site in question is not a part of the beach, but close to it. The petitioners have obtained clearance from both Science and Technology Department and also consent from the Pollution Control Board, so the ban is of no relevance in this case. The court dismisses the petitions and RSA.

In summary, the Kerala High Court heard several writ petitions related to the establishment of a burning ground in Manathala Village by the Chavakkad Municipality. The court found that the site was suitable according to a report from 1994 and that the necessary approvals have been obtained. The court also noted that there were no residential houses or water sources within a radius of 50 meters from the proposed site, and that the rules and regulations connected with the opening of a burning ground have been observed.
