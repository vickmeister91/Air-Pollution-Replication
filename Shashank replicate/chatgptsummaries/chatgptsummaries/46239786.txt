The Supreme Court of India recently heard an appeal by Anirudh Kumar against the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and others. The case involved a dispute over the operation of a pathological lab in a residential area without proper licenses or permissions. The appellant had made complaints to various authorities, but no action was taken. The High Court of Delhi had dismissed the case, stating that it did not fall within its writ jurisdiction. The appellant argued that the lab was operating in violation of the Master Plan for Delhi 2001 and MPD-2021, and without obtaining consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The respondent-owners had been using more area than permitted, including the mezzanine floor, and had covered the set-back area of the building illegally.

The Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides but did not provide a final judgment in the summarized text. However, the court order discusses the importance of public interest litigation in promoting social and economic justice for marginalized and vulnerable communities. It cites several cases where the court has allowed petitions from individuals or organizations advocating for the rights of such communities. The court also emphasizes the need for the government to welcome such litigation and use it as an opportunity to examine whether the poor and downtrodden are receiving their entitlements.

The order also discusses the legal requirements for filing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution and holds that the findings of the lower courts in this case were contrary to the law. Finally, the order concludes that the Regularisation Certificate issued to the respondent-owners of a Pathological Lab was in contravention of building bye-laws and MPD-2021.

In another case, the court heard a dispute between the appellant and respondent-owners regarding the installation of generator sets in a residential building. The appellant claims that the generator sets are causing damage and disturbance to the building and its residents, while the respondent-owners argue that they have the right to install them for their clinical laboratory. The court determines that the case is a matter of public interest and violates the rule of law, and therefore, the writ does lie against the respondents. The court cites legal principles and case law to support its decision.

The court order discusses the applicability of property tax assessment on certain colonies and the extent of permissible mixed use activities in those colonies. It also examines the legality of a Regularisation Certificate granted to the respondent-owners for running a Pathological Lab in a residential area falling under categories "A" and "B". The court finds that the grant of the certificate is not sustainable in law and violates various clauses of the Master Plan 2021 and 2001. The court sets aside the impugned judgment passed by the Division Bench and rules in favor of the appellant.

The court order states that the Regularisation Certificate issued by the MCD for running a Pathological Lab in a building cannot be accepted as it is inconsistent and was granted without seeking permission from the High Court during the pendency of an earlier writ petition. The running of the Pathological Lab has led to emission of hazardous substances, air and noise pollution, and is in violation of various environmental protection laws. The court holds that the running of the Pathological Lab by the respondent-owners in the concerned building is in violation of the law.

Finally, the court order states that despite the High Court examining the case regarding certain clauses of the Regularisation Certificate, there has been a blatant violation of building bye-laws and environmental regulations by the respondent-owners in running a Pathological Lab. This has caused air and sound pollution, adversely affecting public health and peaceful living. The MCD and DPCC have failed to take prompt action and have regularized the illegal activities of the respondent-owners. The court has quashed the Regularisation Certificate and directed the respondent-owners to close down their establishment within four weeks and shift it to alternative premises. If they fail to comply, the MCD is directed to take necessary steps for sealing or closing down the activities. The court has also criticized the conduct of the MCD and DPCC for their inaction and failure to discharge their statutory duties.

In summary, the court orders discussed various disputes related to the operation of a pathological lab in a residential area without proper licenses or permissions. The court emphasized the importance of public interest litigation in promoting social and economic justice for marginalized and vulnerable communities and held that the Regularisation Certificate issued to the respondent-owners of a Pathological Lab was in contravention of building bye-laws and MPD-2021. The court also ruled in favor of the appellant in the case related to the installation of generator sets in a residential building and found that the grant of the Regularisation Certificate for running a Pathological Lab in a residential area was not sustainable in law. The court quashed the Regularisation Certificate and directed the respondent-owners to close down their establishment within four weeks and shift it to alternative premises.
