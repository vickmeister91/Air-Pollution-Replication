In the first court order, two writ petitions were filed by H.L. Mittal and the Indian Society for Educational Innovation against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitions challenged the widening of a road in Barkat Nagar Market to 40 feet and the consequent demolition of structures, shops, etc. The court noted that the width of the road was not determined in previous proceedings, but since it was sanctioned as 40 feet in 1988, it was required to be maintained. The court dismissed the petitions and upheld the 40 feet wide road plan. The court also rejected the petitioner's request to stay the demolition of encroachments on the road, including a school building.

The second court order cited Rule 25 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Building Rules, 1990, stating that the disputed construction was in violation of the sanctioned plan and notices issued by the competent authority of the Corporation. The court emphasized the importance of planned development of cities and has repeatedly approved orders for the demolition of illegal constructions. The court ordered the guilty party to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction and pay for raising construction in violation of the sanctioned plan. The court warned against the consequences of illegal and unauthorized constructions, which destroy the concept of planned development and place an unbearable burden on basic amenities and facilities provided by public authorities. The court dismissed the writ petitions and ordered the removal of encroachments and illegal constructions/structures by November 20, 2012, with demolition to follow if not removed by that date.

In both court orders, the importance of planned development of cities was emphasized. The court in the first order upheld the 40 feet wide road plan, which was sanctioned in 1988, and dismissed the petitions challenging the widening of the road and the consequent demolition of structures. The court in the second order cited Rule 25 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Building Rules, 1990, and ordered the removal of encroachments and illegal constructions/structures by November 20, 2012, with demolition to follow if not removed by that date. The court also ordered the guilty party to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction and pay for raising construction in violation of the sanctioned plan.

The court in both orders warned against the consequences of illegal and unauthorized constructions, which destroy the concept of planned development and place an unbearable burden on basic amenities and facilities provided by public authorities. The court in the second order emphasized the importance of planned development of cities and has repeatedly approved orders for the demolition of illegal constructions. The court also emphasized the need to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction and pay for raising construction in violation of the sanctioned plan.

In conclusion, both court orders emphasized the importance of planned development of cities and the consequences of illegal and unauthorized constructions. The court in the first order upheld the 40 feet wide road plan and dismissed the petitions challenging the widening of the road and the consequent demolition of structures. The court in the second order ordered the removal of encroachments and illegal constructions/structures by November 20, 2012, with demolition to follow if not removed by that date. The court also ordered the guilty party to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction and pay for raising construction in violation of the sanctioned plan.
