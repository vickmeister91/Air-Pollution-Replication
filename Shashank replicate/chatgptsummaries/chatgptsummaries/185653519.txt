The first court order pertains to a case of eviction of a tenant from a property on the grounds of the landlord's bonafide requirement for her married daughter. The tenant filed a leave to defend application, claiming that the landlord was not the owner of the property and had filed forged documents. The court found that there were triable issues and granted the tenant leave to defend, stating that the landlord's ownership and the dependency of the daughter on the landlord for accommodation needed to be established through evidence. The court also noted that the landlord had not responded to the tenant's claims of forged documents.

The second court order grants leave to the respondent to contest a petition for recovery of possession of premises, as there are disputed facts and triable issues raised in the respondent's affidavit seeking leave to defend. The petitioner failed to disclose whether the allegation of forged documents relied upon by her are correct or not. The court finds that the respondent's defence does not appear to be frivolous or untenable on the face of it.

In the first court order, the tenant filed a leave to defend application against the eviction notice issued by the landlord. The landlord had claimed that the property was required for her married daughter's accommodation. However, the tenant claimed that the landlord was not the owner of the property and had filed forged documents. The court found that there were triable issues in the case and granted the tenant leave to defend. The court stated that the landlord's ownership and the dependency of the daughter on the landlord for accommodation needed to be established through evidence. The court also noted that the landlord had not responded to the tenant's claims of forged documents.

The court's decision to grant the tenant leave to defend was based on the fact that there were triable issues in the case. The tenant had raised doubts about the landlord's ownership of the property and had alleged that the landlord had filed forged documents. These were serious allegations that needed to be investigated before the eviction notice could be enforced. The court also noted that the landlord had not responded to the tenant's claims of forged documents, which further strengthened the tenant's case.

In the second court order, the respondent was granted leave to contest a petition for recovery of possession of premises. The petitioner had alleged that the respondent was in illegal possession of the premises and had filed a petition for recovery of possession. However, the respondent filed an affidavit seeking leave to defend, claiming that there were disputed facts and triable issues in the case. The petitioner had failed to disclose whether the allegation of forged documents relied upon by her were correct or not.

The court found that the respondent's defence did not appear to be frivolous or untenable on the face of it. This meant that the respondent had a valid case to contest the petition for recovery of possession. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to disclose whether the allegation of forged documents relied upon by her were correct or not. This was a serious omission on the part of the petitioner and could have serious consequences for the case.

In both court orders, the courts have emphasized the need for evidence to establish ownership and other facts related to the case. The courts have also noted the seriousness of allegations of forged documents and the need to investigate them thoroughly. The courts have granted leave to defend to the tenants/respondents, indicating that they have a valid case to contest the eviction/recovery of possession notices. These court orders highlight the importance of due process and the need for evidence-based decisions in legal cases.
