The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Shri Surender Prakash against Shri Alam for a shop located in Budh Vihar Phase-1, Delhi. The petitioner claimed that he had a bona fide requirement for the shop under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The respondent was served with summons but failed to file a leave to defend application within the prescribed time period. As a result, the court deemed the petitioner's averments to be admitted and passed an eviction order in favor of the petitioner.

However, the petitioner cannot obtain possession of the premises before six months from the date of the order. This is in accordance with the provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act, which stipulate that a landlord cannot take possession of a property before the expiry of six months from the date of the order. This is to provide the tenant with sufficient time to vacate the premises and make alternative arrangements.

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on the petitioner's claim of bona fide requirement. This means that the petitioner had to prove that he genuinely required the shop for his own use and occupation. The court would have considered various factors such as the petitioner's financial position, the availability of alternative premises, and the nature of the petitioner's business before arriving at a decision.

The respondent's failure to file a leave to defend application within the prescribed time period worked against him. A leave to defend application is a legal document that a tenant can file to contest an eviction petition. It allows the tenant to present his case before the court and provide reasons why he should not be evicted. However, if the tenant fails to file this application within the prescribed time period, the court may deem the petitioner's averments to be admitted and pass an eviction order in favor of the petitioner.

It is also worth noting that the court order mentions that the file is to be consigned to the record room after completion of necessary formalities. This means that the court has completed all necessary formalities related to the case and the file will be stored in the record room for future reference. This is a standard practice followed by courts to maintain records of all cases that come before them.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an eviction petition filed by Shri Surender Prakash against Shri Alam for a shop in Budh Vihar Phase-1, Delhi. The court passed an eviction order in favor of the petitioner based on his claim of bona fide requirement. The respondent's failure to file a leave to defend application within the prescribed time period worked against him. The petitioner cannot obtain possession of the premises before six months from the date of the order. Finally, the file is to be consigned to the record room after completion of necessary formalities.
