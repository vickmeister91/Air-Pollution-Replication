The Madras High Court recently heard several cases involving disputes between companies and the government of the Union Territory of Pondicherry. In Writ Appeal Nos. 522 and 857 of 2001, W.P.No. 18290 of 2000, C.M.P.Nos. 7638, 11438 and 12874 of 2001, W.A.M.P.No. 19997 of 2001 and W.M.P.No. 26495 of 2000, M/s.Sumangala Steels Limited sought a writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash proceedings against them for arrears of electricity charges. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately made a judgment.

One of the cases involved a dispute between the Petitioner Company and the government regarding the eligibility of the company for subsidy benefits under G.O.Ms.No.9/91 dated 11.2.1991. The main issue was whether the Petitioner Company's new unit, which produces steel billets, is an expansion of the existing unit or a new unit. The court examined the conditions stipulated in the government order and concluded that the Petitioner Company had already availed the power tariff concession for the full five years period commencing from 1.8.1987 to 30.9.1992 and is not entitled to claim any subsidy benefit under G.O.Ms.No.9/91 dated 11.2.1991. The court also considered the argument that the new unit is physically, mechanically, and electrically separated from the old unit and produces a different product, but ultimately ruled against the Petitioner Company.

Another case discussed the criteria for determining whether a process is considered manufacturing, which includes whether a new commercial commodity is created and whether the original commodity is no longer useful except for the new process. The case in question involved a company that produces aluminum billets for irrigation pipes and sells them in the open market, which qualifies as a new commercial commodity. The order also discussed a power subsidy scheme and whether the company qualifies for it based on certain conditions, including obtaining a power feasibility certificate for the new unit with increased capacity, which the company did not have prior to the crucial cut-off date.

In another case, a company claimed power subsidy under a government scheme for its new unit with increased capacity. However, the court found that the company did not obtain the necessary power feasibility certificate for the new unit prior to the deadline and could not claim the subsidy. The court also noted that internal communications and note files cannot be considered as orders issued by the competent authority. The court ultimately denied the company's claim for subsidy and tariff concession.

A writ petition was filed by a company seeking benefits for a new unit in a backward area. The court found that the company did not fulfill the necessary conditions to claim the benefit of subsidy/tariff concession. The court also found that the company did not obtain necessary permissions from the government before expanding its capacity and establishing a new unit. The court rejected the company's claim of being a new unit and found that it was only an expansion of the existing unit. The court concluded that the company was not entitled to the writ of mandamus as prayed for.

In another case, a steel plant had expanded its capacity under the government's Minimum Economic Scale of Operation policy. The plant had not obtained the necessary clearances for starting a new unit, and all approvals were for the expansion of the existing unit. The court held that the increased capacity was only an expansion of the existing unit and not a new unit, and therefore, the plant was not entitled to power subsidy benefits. The court also dismissed a writ petition seeking to stop the collection of electricity charges under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, as the plant was no longer a sick industry.

The court order was copied to six different individuals or departments in the Union Territory of Pondicherry, including the Chief Secretary, Minister for Industries, and various government departments related to power and electricity. Overall, the court's judgments in these cases were based on careful consideration of the relevant laws and regulations, and the court's decisions were made in accordance with the evidence presented.
