The Telangana High Court recently heard a writ petition requesting a writ of Certiorari to quash an order passed by the National Green Tribunal and to direct officials to protect a water body in Andhra Pradesh. The National Green Tribunal had previously issued an order directing the District Collector to ensure that no construction activity takes place in relation to the water body for four weeks. The petitioner argued that the water body was being encroached upon and that the construction activity was causing irreparable damage to the environment.

The High Court found that the subject matter of the two applications was substantially the same and that filing parallel proceedings was not permissible. The court set aside the order under challenge and gave the petitioner the liberty to obtain necessary orders from the National Green Tribunal. The court also directed the District Collector to ensure that no construction activity takes place in relation to the water body until further orders are passed by the National Green Tribunal.

The court observed that the National Green Tribunal had already taken cognizance of the matter and had issued an order to protect the water body. The court noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the National Green Tribunal and had instead filed a separate writ petition in the High Court. The court held that this was not permissible and that the petitioner should have approached the National Green Tribunal for appropriate relief.

The court also observed that the National Green Tribunal had the expertise and experience to deal with environmental matters and that it was best equipped to handle the present case. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal had already issued an order to protect the water body and that it was the duty of the District Collector to ensure that the order was implemented.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference by the High Court. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any new material or evidence to show that the National Green Tribunal had erred in its order. The court held that the petitioner had merely re-argued the same points that were already considered by the National Green Tribunal.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the order under challenge and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal for appropriate relief. The court also directed the District Collector to ensure that no construction activity takes place in relation to the water body until further orders are passed by the National Green Tribunal.

This case highlights the importance of approaching the appropriate forum for relief in environmental matters. The National Green Tribunal has been established as a specialized forum to deal with environmental disputes and has the expertise and experience to handle such matters. Filing parallel proceedings in different forums can lead to confusion and delay in the resolution of environmental disputes. It is therefore important for litigants to approach the National Green Tribunal for appropriate relief in environmental matters.
