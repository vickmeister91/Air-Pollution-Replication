The court order pertains to a case filed by the Wildlife Inspector against four accused persons under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The complaint alleged that the accused were jointly responsible for conducting the day-to-day business of a partnership firm dealing in ivory articles, and had committed an offence under Section 9 and 49(b)(1) of the Act. After summoning the accused persons, pre-charge evidence was recorded, and a charge was framed against one accused person, Abdul Rehman, who pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution examined three witnesses, who supported the prosecution case. The accused denied the allegations made in the complaint and stated that he had been falsely implicated in the case. The court found the accused guilty and convicted him.

The court order states that the accused, who is a partner in a firm dealing with ivory articles, was found in possession of excess ivory articles without a license during an inspection. The prosecution has established that the accused was present during the inspection and his signatures were found on the inspection memo. The accused failed to prove that his signatures were obtained on blank papers. The court also mentions that the accused failed to establish that the firm had a license to deal with the excess articles. The court concludes that the accused is guilty of contravening section 49-B(1) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and is convicted for the offense.
