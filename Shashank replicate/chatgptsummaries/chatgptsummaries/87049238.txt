The Kerala High Court recently heard a case (WP(C).No. 17180 of 2012) in which the petitioners complained about pollution caused by a chicken farm and meat stall run by the fourth respondent. The petitioners sought a direction against the Panchayath, the Kerala Pollution Control Board, and the District Medical Officer, who refused to grant a license or consent to conduct the chicken farm. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various exhibits before delivering a judgment.

The court order pertains to a chicken farm and slaughterhouse causing nuisance to neighboring residents due to unhygienic conditions. The petitioner had a license for the farm but not for the meat stall. The court ruled that the petitioner must obtain a license for both and comply with regulations to avoid pollution. The opinion of the DMO was deemed irrelevant, and the PCB was responsible for ensuring compliance with regulations. The petitioner was allowed to conduct the farm and meat stall after obtaining necessary licenses and complying with regulations.
