The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Shravan, filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.PC, challenging the order passed by the Third Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur, in Criminal Revision No.161/14. The petitioner had filed two applications, one under Section 45 of the Evidence Act and the other under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, which were dismissed by the trial court. The petitioner had sought to send the cheque for examination by a handwriting expert to ascertain whether the handwriting on the cheque was his own or the respondent's. The court dismissed the petition, upholding the impugned order, as the petitioner had not disputed the fact that the cheque bore his signature, and his first application under Section 45 of the Evidence Act had been dismissed.

The case in question revolves around a cheque that was allegedly issued by the petitioner, Shravan, to the respondent. The petitioner had filed two applications in the trial court, one under Section 45 of the Evidence Act and the other under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, seeking to send the cheque for examination by a handwriting expert to ascertain whether the handwriting on the cheque was his own or the respondent's. The trial court dismissed both applications, and the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.PC challenging the order passed by the trial court.

The petitioner's contention was that the trial court had erred in dismissing his applications under Section 45 of the Evidence Act and Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. He argued that the handwriting on the cheque was not his own, and that it was necessary to send the cheque for examination by a handwriting expert to establish this fact. The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner had not disputed the fact that the cheque bore his signature, and that his first application under Section 45 of the Evidence Act had been dismissed.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner had not disputed the fact that the cheque bore his signature, and that his first application under Section 45 of the Evidence Act had been dismissed. The court also held that the trial court had not erred in dismissing the petitioner's applications under Section 45 of the Evidence Act and Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, as the petitioner had not made out a case for sending the cheque for examination by a handwriting expert.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the principle that a petitioner must make out a case for sending a document for examination by a handwriting expert. The court held that the mere fact that a document bears a person's signature does not necessarily mean that the handwriting on the document is that person's own. However, in order to establish this fact, the petitioner must make out a case for sending the document for examination by a handwriting expert.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner had filed a petition challenging the order passed by the trial court dismissing his applications under Section 45 of the Evidence Act and Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner, upholding the impugned order. The court's decision reaffirms the principle that a petitioner must make out a case for sending a document for examination by a handwriting expert.
