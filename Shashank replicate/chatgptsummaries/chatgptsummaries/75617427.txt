In the first court order, the case was filed by WLI Sh. SS Negi against Vicky Makhija for contravention of section 9/49/49(B)(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that Vicky was found in possession of a live Indian Soft Shelled Turtle, which is protected under Schedule-I of the Act. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The court heard arguments and reserved the order, which was delivered on 19 July 2014, acquitting the accused. The court considered the evidence presented by both sides, including witness statements and relevant provisions of the Act.

In the second court order, the court prohibited the purchase or acquisition of captive or wild animals, animal articles, trophies, uncured trophies, or meat derived from them, except from authorized dealers. The case involves the alleged possession of a turtle by the accused, but the prosecution failed to prove the charges against the accused under Section 9 and 49B(1) of the Act. The place of recovery of the turtle is doubtful, and there are contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses. The absence of independent witnesses casts doubt on the prosecution's version, and the accused is acquitted.

In the third court order, the official witness was not reliable and trustworthy, and there was no independent source to corroborate the prosecution's version. The prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and in this case, the complainant failed to do so. The accused is acquitted and directed to furnish a fresh bail bond. The case property, if any, will be confiscated to the state, and the judgment will be sent to the server.

In all three court orders, the accused was acquitted due to lack of evidence and unreliable witnesses. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, protects endangered species of animals and prohibits their trade and possession without proper authorization. The court orders emphasize the importance of following the provisions of the Act and the need for reliable evidence to prove the charges against the accused. The court also highlights the need for independent witnesses to corroborate the prosecution's version and the importance of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt.
