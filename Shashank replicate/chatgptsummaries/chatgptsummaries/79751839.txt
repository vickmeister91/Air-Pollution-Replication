The court has issued two orders pertaining to the cleanliness and hygiene of the city of Jaipur. The first order was in response to a writ petition filed by Vimal Chaudhary, Advocate, seeking directions to the Municipal Corporation of Jaipur to ensure cleanliness in the city. The court directed the Corporation to perform its statutory duties and issued various directions to ensure cleanliness, including the formation of awareness groups and regular inspections by the Municipal Commissioner and Supervisory Staff. The court also noted the inadequacy of staff and machinery and emphasized that non-availability of funds cannot be pleaded as grounds for non-performance of statutory obligations. The court rejected the suggestion to adopt a single-tier system for cleaning the city but agreed to follow the other suggestions put forth by the petitioner.

The second order pertains to the duty of the municipality to keep the city clean and hygienic. The court directs the municipality to draft a plan for the removal of nuisance caused by open drains and public excretion by nearby slum dwellers. The court also reminds the state government of its duties under the constitution of India to provide a hygienic environment and healthy services to the people. The court issues several directions to ensure the cleanliness of the city, including increasing the strength of scavenging staff, deploying sanitary workers in each ward, preventing abadi nuisance caused by straying pigs, and constructing additional garbage collection centers. The court also directs the state government to consider setting up mobile sanitation courts to punish offenders who violate sanitation laws. The court orders compliance of the directions within three months and monitoring of progress every three months.
