The South India Paper Mills Limited and its Managing Director had filed a criminal petition to quash a complaint and proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. They argued that the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had already taken action against them for the same allegations and had withdrawn their consent for operation. However, the Appellate Authority had allowed their appeal and granted them fresh consent. The respondent, B.M. Ramu, had raised the same allegations in his complaint, which the court found to be an abuse of process since the matter had already been adjudicated and decided by the Appellate Authority. The court allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings.
