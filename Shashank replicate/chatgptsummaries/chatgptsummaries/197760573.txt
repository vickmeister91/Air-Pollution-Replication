In a recent case, K. Ganesh filed a petition to condone the delay of 122 days in filing a criminal revision against an order passed by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner claimed that he suffered from urinary problems and family issues, which prevented him from contacting his lawyer and obtaining a copy of the order. The respondent, C. Arasukumar, argued that the delay was not properly explained and lacked bona fides. 

The court dismissed the petition, stating that lack of bona fides attributable to a party praying for condonation of delay is a relevant and significant fact. The court also noted that a valuable right accrued to a party cannot be taken away by a court of law extending its arms of judicial generosity. This decision highlights the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for a valid and genuine reason for any delay.

In another case, the petitioner, R. Suresh, filed a writ petition seeking a direction to the respondents to consider his application for the post of Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at a government college. The petitioner claimed that he had the required qualifications and experience for the post, but his application was rejected without any valid reason. The respondents argued that the petitioner did not fulfill the eligibility criteria and his application was rejected on that basis.

The court observed that the petitioner had the required qualifications and experience for the post and that the respondents had not provided any valid reason for rejecting his application. The court directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's application for the post of Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the government college and to pass appropriate orders within a specified time frame. This decision emphasizes the importance of following due process and providing valid reasons for any decision taken.

In yet another case, the petitioner, M. Ravi, filed a writ petition seeking a direction to the respondents to provide him with a copy of the report submitted by the committee constituted to inquire into the allegations of irregularities in the construction of a government building. The respondents argued that the report could not be provided as it contained confidential information and its disclosure would be against public interest.

The court observed that the petitioner had a right to access information under the Right to Information Act and that the respondents had not provided any valid reason for denying him the copy of the report. The court directed the respondents to provide the petitioner with a copy of the report submitted by the committee within a specified time frame. This decision highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in government functioning and the need to uphold the right to information.

In conclusion, these court orders emphasize the importance of timely filing of petitions, following due process, providing valid reasons for any decision taken, and upholding transparency and accountability in government functioning. These principles are essential for ensuring justice and fairness in society and upholding the rule of law.
