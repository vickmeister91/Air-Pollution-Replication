In a recent court order, the applicant, Mukesh, was granted bail after being accused of causing the death of a wild pig by electric shock. The defense argued that the death was accidental and that there was no legal evidence against the applicant. The court allowed the bail application, subject to certain conditions, including that the applicant not tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses.

The case against Mukesh was based on allegations that he had intentionally caused the death of a wild pig by electrocuting it. The prosecution argued that Mukesh had set up an electric fence around his farm to keep wild animals away, and that the pig had accidentally come into contact with the fence and died as a result.

However, the defense argued that there was no evidence to support the prosecution's claims, and that the death of the pig was accidental. They also pointed out that Mukesh had no prior criminal record and was not a flight risk, and therefore should be granted bail.

After considering the arguments presented by both sides, the court granted bail to Mukesh, subject to certain conditions. These conditions included that he not tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses, and that he report to the police station regularly.

The decision to grant bail to Mukesh was based on the principle of presumption of innocence, which holds that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The court found that there was no legal evidence against Mukesh, and that he should be given the opportunity to defend himself in court.

The case highlights the importance of ensuring that the legal system operates on the basis of fairness and justice. It is essential that individuals are given the opportunity to defend themselves against allegations, and that they are not unfairly punished before they have had the chance to do so.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Mukesh was based on the principle of presumption of innocence, and the lack of legal evidence against him. The conditions imposed on his bail ensure that he will not interfere with the legal process, and that justice will be served in a fair and impartial manner.
