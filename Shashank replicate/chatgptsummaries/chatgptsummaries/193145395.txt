The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner to set aside an order passed in M.P.No.1381 of 2009 in C.C No.2520 of 2008 on the file of the learned XV Metropolitan Magistrate, George Town, Chennai dated 19.02.2010. The petitioner had requested some vital documents to be produced before the Trial Court to prove his innocence. However, the trial court dismissed the application, which the High Court found warranted interference.

The High Court allowed the petition, set aside the order passed by the trial court, and directed the respondent/complainant to produce the documents as sought for by the petitioner/accused. The trial court was directed to take up the complaint on a day-to-day basis and dispose of the same within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

The petitioner's request for the production of vital documents was crucial to his defense, and the trial court's dismissal of the application was a clear violation of his rights. The High Court's decision to set aside the order and direct the respondent/complainant to produce the documents was a just and fair ruling.

The High Court's directive for the trial court to take up the complaint on a day-to-day basis and dispose of the same within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order was a necessary step to ensure that justice was served in a timely manner. The petitioner had already been waiting for a long time for the trial to conclude, and any further delay would have been a violation of his rights.

In conclusion, the High Court's decision to allow the petition, set aside the order passed by the trial court, and direct the respondent/complainant to produce the documents as sought for by the petitioner/accused was a just and fair ruling. The directive for the trial court to take up the complaint on a day-to-day basis and dispose of the same within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order was a necessary step to ensure that justice was served in a timely manner.
