The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the protection of forest land and closed areas under the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 (PLP Act) in the State of Haryana, India. The court has consistently ruled that such areas must be treated as forest land and that construction carried out on this land is in violation of the notification dated 18th August, 1992. The court has expressed concern over the environmental degradation caused by influential colonizers and a strong mining lobby in Haryana, and the irreversible damage caused to the Aravalli hills.

In one case, the court ordered the closure of an area between Surajkund and Badkal Lake to prevent environmental degradation due to mining, quarrying, and construction activities. The area was brought under the provisions of the PLP Act, and a notification was issued prohibiting certain acts for a period of 30 years. The court also refers to a public interest litigation regarding deforestation and environmental issues in the Aravalli hills.

In another case, the court discussed a modified plan and maps that excluded some areas from the 1 km green belt originally proposed. The court directed that these areas could be urbanized in accordance with applicable laws and rules. Private lands adjoining the Surajkund complex were directed to only permit single-storey "hutments" to be constructed, not tall buildings as originally conceived. The court order was in modification or substitution of all earlier orders in that regard. The order did not permit the applicants to ignore the notification dated 18th August, 1992. The court also discussed the definition of "forest" and "forest land" and the need for prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. The State of Haryana had acknowledged its treatment of PLP Act areas as forest land even before the court order was passed.

The court has consistently held the State of Haryana accountable for its conflicting and self-destructive stand taken in spite of affidavits filed by the Chief Secretary of the State of Haryana from time to time supporting the Forest Department. The court has also noted that closed areas under the PLP Act cannot be utilized for non-forest purposes without the prior permission of the Central Government under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

In the Kant Enclave case, the court ordered a full refund of investment with interest for those who were conveyed land by R. Kant & Co. and demolishing of illegal constructions made after 18th August 1992. The court also criticizes the State of Haryana for its support of the applicants and the damage caused to the environment and ecology of the Aravalli hills. The court has directed R. Kant & Co. and the Town & Country Department of the State of Haryana to compensate investors for their investment in the land along with interest at 18% per annum. For those who constructed after 18th August, 1992 and whose construction is directed to be demolished, a tentative amount of ₹50 lakhs will be paid by R. Kant & Co. and the Town & Country Planning Department of the State of Haryana. The court has also directed R. Kant & Co. to deposit 10% of the amount spent on developing Kant Enclave (₹50 crore) for rehabilitation of the damaged areas in the Aravalli Rehabilitation Fund. The Chief Secretary of the State of Haryana has been directed to ensure compliance with the court's orders by 31st December, 2018.
