The court order in question pertains to a case where the owner of a truck challenged the rejection of his application to release the vehicle on Supardiginama. The truck had been seized by the forest department for transporting agricultural cattle and smuggled timber. The applicant's petition was dismissed by the court, which directed him to file an application for Supardiginama before the Confiscating Authority.

The court also made it clear that the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Forest Act were different, and the judgment of the Madhukar Rao case could not be applied to the Forest Act. This means that the applicant could not rely on the Madhukar Rao case to support his argument that the truck should be released on Supardiginama.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the relevant laws and precedents. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto. The Forest Act, on the other hand, is a law that provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that the truck had been seized for transporting agricultural cattle and smuggled timber. This is a clear violation of the Forest Act, which prohibits the transportation of forest produce without a valid permit. The court therefore held that the truck could not be released on Supardiginama, as the Forest Act did not provide for such a provision.

The court's order also directed that a copy of the order be sent to both the lower courts for information and compliance. This means that the lower courts will be informed of the court's decision and will be required to comply with it.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case was based on a careful consideration of the relevant laws and precedents. The court held that the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Forest Act were different, and that the judgment of the Madhukar Rao case could not be applied to the Forest Act. The court also held that the truck could not be released on Supardiginama, as the Forest Act did not provide for such a provision. The court's order was directed to both the lower courts for information and compliance.
