The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the accused are being prosecuted for white-collar offenses. The accused had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking production of certain documents for their effective defense. However, the Trial Court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents were not necessary. The accused challenged this decision, stating that their right to an effective defense cannot be curtailed or scuttled.

The court, in its ruling, held that the need to put up a defense cannot be weighed in a golden scale by the court, and the prosecution cannot say it is more than sufficient. The court emphasized that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right, and the accused must be given every opportunity to defend themselves. The court further stated that the accused have a right to access all relevant documents that may assist them in their defense.

The court ordered the Trial Court to send for the documents listed in the petition from the concerned department, except the General Diary. The court clarified that the General Diary is not a document that can be produced under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court also directed the Trial Court to ensure that the documents are produced in a timely manner so that the accused can effectively use them in their defense.

This court order is significant as it upholds the right of the accused to a fair trial and emphasizes the importance of access to relevant documents for an effective defense. The court's ruling also highlights the fact that the need for a defense cannot be weighed in a golden scale by the court, and the prosecution cannot say it is more than sufficient. This ruling serves as a reminder to Trial Courts to ensure that the accused are given every opportunity to defend themselves and that their right to a fair trial is upheld.
