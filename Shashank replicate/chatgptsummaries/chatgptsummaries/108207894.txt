The Delhi High Court recently heard a case in which Krishna Continental Ltd. sought a direction to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to refund Rs. 39,54,900/- to the petitioner along with interest @18% p.a. from the date of deposit till its realization. The petitioner had been running a hotel without obtaining a "consent to establish" and "consent to operate" and without installation of any anti-pollution equipment for the last twenty years. The court held that a writ petition solely praying for refund of money against the State is not maintainable and dismissed the case.

The court order states that the petitioner has been polluting the city for the past 20 years without obtaining necessary consents. The court deems this non-compliance as a serious violation of environmental law and dismisses the petitioner's writ petition.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining necessary consents and installing anti-pollution equipment for businesses that may have an impact on the environment. The court's decision to dismiss the case emphasizes the seriousness of environmental violations and the need for businesses to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee is responsible for enforcing environmental laws and regulations in the city. The committee has the power to issue consents to businesses that comply with environmental standards and to take action against those that do not. The committee's role is crucial in ensuring that businesses operate in an environmentally responsible manner and do not harm the environment.

The court's decision to dismiss the case also highlights the importance of taking legal action against businesses that violate environmental laws. Legal action can serve as a deterrent to other businesses and can help to ensure that environmental laws are enforced.

The case also raises questions about the effectiveness of environmental regulations in India. Despite the existence of environmental laws and regulations, businesses continue to violate them. This highlights the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms and penalties for non-compliance.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision to dismiss the case brought by Krishna Continental Ltd. highlights the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations. The court's decision emphasizes the seriousness of environmental violations and the need for businesses to take responsibility for their impact on the environment. The case also raises questions about the effectiveness of environmental regulations in India and the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms.
