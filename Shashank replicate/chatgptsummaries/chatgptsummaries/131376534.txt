The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by K.S. Vinod and eight others against the State of Karnataka and Anil Shetty. The petitioners were accused of several offenses under the Indian Penal Code, and the police had filed a charge-sheet against them. The prosecution subsequently filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking a direction to secure further investigation report conducted by the Investigating Officer as per the order dated 20.10.2010 passed by the Human Rights Commission.

The petitioners had filed objections, but the Magistrate allowed the application. The petitioners were aggrieved by this and had filed a petition before the Sessions Judge in Criminal Revision Petition No.285/2014, which was rejected. The court observed that the petition may be misconceived as the application filed before the Magistrate under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was not to call for the records from the Human Rights Commission, but to summon the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. by the CPI, N.R. Pura, in terms of Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C.

The court disposed of the petition with the observation that no material produced by the Human Rights Commission can be utilized in the proceedings before the Magistrate. This means that the Human Rights Commission's report cannot be used as evidence in the case against the petitioners.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This section allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court's decision in this case makes it clear that the section cannot be used to call for records from other bodies, such as the Human Rights Commission.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of due process in criminal proceedings. The petitioners had objected to the prosecution's application under Section 91, but the Magistrate had allowed it anyway. The petitioners then sought relief from the Sessions Judge, but their petition was rejected. However, the court's decision in this case shows that the petitioners had a valid objection, and that the Magistrate's decision was incorrect.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and highlights the importance of due process in criminal proceedings. It also serves as a reminder that the courts are there to ensure that justice is done, and that all parties are treated fairly and in accordance with the law.
