The court order in question relates to a civil application filed by Trumac Engineering Co. Ltd against PJ Patel. The application sought a declaration that the applicant should not be required to contribute 1% of the amount as directed in the judgment. The court heard arguments from both parties and ultimately found that the applicant was not polluting as of the date of the judgment and was therefore entitled to the declaration sought.

The case at hand appears to have centered around environmental concerns, with the applicant arguing that they were not responsible for any pollution at the time of the judgment. The court appears to have agreed with this argument, ultimately ruling in favor of the applicant and allowing their application.

It is worth noting that the court's decision was based on the specific circumstances of this case, and may not necessarily apply to other similar cases. However, the ruling does provide some insight into how courts may approach similar cases in the future.

Overall, the court order in question represents an important victory for Trumac Engineering Co. Ltd, as it allows them to avoid having to contribute the 1% amount as directed in the original judgment. The ruling also highlights the importance of environmental concerns in legal proceedings, and serves as a reminder that companies must take steps to ensure that they are not polluting the environment.
