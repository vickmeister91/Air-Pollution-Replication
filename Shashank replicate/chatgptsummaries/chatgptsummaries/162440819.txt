In December 2014, the Kerala High Court delivered a judgment in a writ petition filed by Antony A.V. against the Corporation of Cochin and others. The petitioner had alleged that the 4th respondent had constructed a multi-storeyed building within 100 meters of the High Tide Line of Chilavannur lake, violating the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification. The petitioner had submitted several complaints to the authorities, but no action was taken. The 3rd respondent informed the petitioner that they had issued directions to stop the unauthorized construction violating the CRZ Notification. The 4th respondent claimed that they had obtained all necessary permits and clearances. The court heard arguments from all parties involved.

The court order states that constructions with an investment of over 5 crores require prior CRZ clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India. The 4th respondent claimed to have obtained CRZ clearance, but the committee found that the project was only referred to the MoEF and no approval was given. The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) is not authorized to issue CRZ clearance, and the 4th respondent started construction without obtaining necessary clearance. The committee found that the 4th respondent violated CRZ norms and notifications by reclaiming land and constructing without clearance. The SEIAA's decision to approve environmental clearance without State Expert Appraisal Committee's (SEAC) recommendation is illegal, and the decisions and observations in previous meetings were not taken into account. The committee concluded that the 4th respondent violated CRZ norms and notifications.

The court found that the project had violated the law and ordered the demolition of the buildings constructed in violation of CRZ notifications. The court also noted that environmental degradation is best protected by citizens themselves and that the right to life includes the right to enjoy nature in its present form.

The case highlights the importance of following environmental regulations and obtaining necessary clearances before undertaking any construction activity. The CRZ Notification aims to protect the coastal environment and prevent its degradation. The notification prohibits certain activities within the CRZ, including construction of buildings and other structures. The notification also requires prior clearance from the MoEF for certain activities, including construction projects with an investment of over 5 crores.

The court's decision to order the demolition of the buildings constructed in violation of CRZ notifications sends a strong message to developers and authorities that environmental regulations must be followed. The court's observation that citizens have a role to play in protecting the environment is also significant. It highlights the need for greater public awareness and participation in environmental protection.

In conclusion, the court order in the writ petition filed by Antony A.V. against the Corporation of Cochin and others highlights the importance of following environmental regulations and obtaining necessary clearances before undertaking any construction activity. The court's decision to order the demolition of the buildings constructed in violation of CRZ notifications sends a strong message to developers and authorities that environmental regulations must be followed. The court's observation that citizens have a role to play in protecting the environment is also significant and highlights the need for greater public awareness and participation in environmental protection.
