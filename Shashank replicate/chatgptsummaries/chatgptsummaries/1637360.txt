In a recent court order, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal dismissed a claim petition filed by two sons of a deceased victim of a motor vehicle accident. The claimants had sought compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs, but the tribunal dismissed their claim, stating that the accident was an act of God. However, the court overturned this decision and held that the accident was caused due to the carelessness and negligence of the car driver. As a result, the claimants were entitled to compensation of Rs. 1,26,000/- along with interest at 6% per annum.

The court's decision was based on the principle of 'strict liability', which holds that the owner of a vehicle is liable for any damage caused by it, regardless of whether they were directly responsible for the accident. In this case, the car involved in the accident belonged to the PRTC (Punjab Roadways Transport Corporation), and the court held that the PRTC was liable to pay compensation to the claimants as they had lost their father in an accident involving one of its vehicles.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of holding vehicle owners accountable for accidents caused by their vehicles, even if they were not directly responsible for the accident. This principle of strict liability is intended to ensure that victims of accidents are adequately compensated for their losses, and that vehicle owners take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their vehicles and drivers.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of careful driving and adherence to traffic rules and regulations. The accident in question was caused due to the negligence of the car driver, who failed to exercise due care and caution while driving. This highlights the need for drivers to be vigilant and responsible while on the road, and to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of themselves and others.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of road safety and the need for vehicle owners and drivers to take responsibility for their actions. It also highlights the role of the legal system in ensuring that victims of accidents are adequately compensated for their losses, and that those responsible for causing accidents are held accountable for their actions.
