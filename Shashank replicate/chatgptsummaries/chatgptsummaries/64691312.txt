Two court orders have been summarized in the given text. Both orders pertain to the violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the possession of mongoose hair brushes without a permit or license. The first order convicts Babloo under section 55 of the Act, while the second order finds the accused guilty of contravening the provisions of the Act.

In the first order, Babloo and another person were accused of contravening the provisions of section 44, 49, and 49B(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The complainant filed a complaint against them for possessing mongoose hair brushes derived from a wild animal specified in Part II of Schedule-II of the Act. The court found the prosecution's case to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and convicted Babloo under section 55 of the Act.

Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act. It states that whoever contravenes any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In the second order, the accused failed to provide evidence to rebut the presumption of illegal custody of mongoose hair brushes found in their possession. The prosecution proved their case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused were found guilty of contravening the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The accused will be heard on sentence, and the judgment will be sent to the Delhi District Court website.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an important legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products, except under certain circumstances and with the permission of the authorities.

The possession of mongoose hair brushes without a permit or license is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, as mongoose is a protected species under the Act. Mongoose hair brushes are in demand for their softness and durability, and are often used in the manufacture of high-end cosmetic brushes. However, the use of such brushes is illegal and can lead to severe penalties under the Act.

In conclusion, the court orders summarized in the given text highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, provides for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats, and prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The possession of mongoose hair brushes without a permit or license is a violation of the Act, and can lead to severe penalties. The court orders serve as a reminder to the public to respect and protect wildlife, and to abide by the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act.
