The court orders discussed pertain to Stelco Industries Limited, a steel production company located in a residential area. The first petition was filed by a resident seeking the re-allocation of the industry to an alternative site due to noise and air pollution caused by the industry.

The court dismissed the petitioner's request for re-allocation of the industry to another site.

The second court order pertains to Stelco Industries Limited's application for varied consents under the Water Act and Air Act for the production of steel strips.

The industry had also increased its power load and production capacity without prior approval. The Board issued a show cause notice and took decisions to ensure compliance with pollution control laws. The court dismissed the petition seeking dismissal of the case, stating that the industry had obtained the necessary permissions and was complying with pollution control laws.
