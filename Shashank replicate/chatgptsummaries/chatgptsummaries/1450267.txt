In a recent court order, Mohd. Naseem, who was accused of possessing tiger skin, was granted bail by the court. The court based its decision on two key factors. Firstly, there was no evidence to suggest that Naseem had killed the tiger himself. Secondly, the maximum sentence for the offense was three years, which the court deemed to be a relatively minor offense.

The court also took into account the fact that there was no reason to believe that Naseem would tamper with witnesses or abscond if released on bail. This was likely due to the fact that Naseem had no prior criminal record and had cooperated fully with the authorities during the investigation.

As a condition of his bail, Naseem was ordered to furnish a personal bond and two sureties to the satisfaction of the court. This is a common requirement in bail cases, as it ensures that the accused will appear in court when required and will not flee the jurisdiction.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Naseem was based on a careful consideration of the evidence and the circumstances of the case. While the offense of possessing tiger skin is a serious one, the court determined that Naseem was not a flight risk and was unlikely to interfere with the investigation. As such, the court felt that bail was an appropriate course of action in this case.
