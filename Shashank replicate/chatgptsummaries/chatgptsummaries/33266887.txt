The Indian courts have recently issued several orders related to the implementation of Mass Emission Standards for motor vehicles. These orders have been issued in response to writ appeals challenging the implementation of Bharat Stage IV (BS IV) standards in various states and union territories in India.

One of the court orders pertains to a group of writ appeals challenging a judgment in a case related to the implementation of Mass Emission Standards 'Bharat Stage IV' (BS IV) in Kerala. The appellants in the case are manufacturers and authorized dealers of commercial passenger/goods vehicles, as well as individuals who purchased Heavy Passenger Motor Vehicle chassis fitted with diesel engines meeting the Mass Emission Standards 'Bharat Stage III' (BS III). The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the implementation of BS IV standards for all 'M' and 'N' category vehicles, including those with more than four wheels.

Another court order discusses the implementation of Mass Emission Standards for different categories of petrol/diesel-driven motor vehicles in India. The Central Government notified the standards for Bharat Stage II, III, and IV, with different classifications for motor cars, four-wheeler passenger vehicles, and vehicles with GVW exceeding 3500kg. The implementation of these standards varied by region and date, with the latest being the nationwide implementation of BS IV for four-wheeled vehicles manufactured on or after April 1, 2017. The order includes specific details on the cities and states where the standards were implemented and the types of vehicles affected.

The third court order pertains to the implementation of Mass Emission Standards 'BS IV' for four-wheeled vehicles manufactured on or after certain dates in various states and union territories in India. The order also specifies the categories of vehicles that fall under the mass emission standards and the provisions for On-Board Diagnostic systems for emission control. The order also mentions a previous case where the eligibility criteria for trucks to be offered by bidders was challenged and dismissed by the court.

The fourth court order discusses a case where a petitioner filed a writ petition to participate in a tender process for trucks. The court dismissed the petition, but the petitioner filed another petition, which was also dismissed. The court upheld the requirement for trucks to comply with 'BS III' norms to reduce pollution in the National Capital Region. The court also ruled that 'BS IV' emission standards apply to all vehicles, including those with more than four wheels, and the state government cannot grant exemptions. The court dismissed the writ appeals and upheld the judgment of the learned Single Judge.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of implementing Mass Emission Standards for motor vehicles in India to reduce pollution and protect public health. The orders provide specific details on the categories of vehicles that fall under the standards, the provisions for On-Board Diagnostic systems for emission control, and the cities and states where the standards have been implemented. The courts have also upheld the implementation of BS IV standards for all vehicles, including those with more than four wheels, and have dismissed petitions challenging the eligibility criteria for trucks to be offered by bidders. These orders demonstrate the Indian government's commitment to reducing pollution and promoting sustainable development in the country.
