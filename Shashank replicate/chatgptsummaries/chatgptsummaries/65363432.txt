The recent court order pertains to a series of petitions filed by the State of Rajasthan against the Collector of Bundi and others. The issue at hand is related to the alteration of boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The State argues that the issue is already covered by a previous judgment and should be decided accordingly. The respondents, on the other hand, argue that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

After hearing both sides, the court ruled that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries and the impugned orders are set aside. The matter is remanded to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents in accordance with the Act.

The court's decision is based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court noted that Section 24(2)(a) of the Act empowers the State Government to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary or a national park, but only after following the due process of law. The court observed that the Collector had not followed the due process of law while altering the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary.

The court also noted that the Collector had not taken into account the objections raised by the respondents before altering the boundaries. The court held that the Collector was duty-bound to consider the objections raised by the respondents before taking any decision on altering the boundaries. The court observed that the Collector had failed to discharge this duty and had acted arbitrarily in altering the boundaries.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rule of law and ensures that the due process of law is followed while making decisions related to the protection of wildlife. The court's decision also highlights the importance of considering the objections raised by stakeholders before making any decision that affects their rights and interests.

It sends a strong message to the authorities that they must follow the due process of law while making decisions related to the protection of wildlife. The decision also underscores the importance of stakeholder participation in decision-making processes related to the protection of wildlife.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the case of the State of Rajasthan vs. the Collector of Bundi and others is a significant development in the protection of wildlife in India.
