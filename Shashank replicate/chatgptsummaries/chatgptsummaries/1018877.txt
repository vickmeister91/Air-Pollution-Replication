The first court order pertains to a dispute over an industrial site in Chandigarh that was rented out by the original allottee to the petitioners for purposes other than industrial. The estate officer passed a resumption order, which was challenged by the petitioners in various forums. The matter was remanded back to the highest authority, who set aside the resumption order subject to the condition that the petitioners regularize the misuse in accordance with the conversion policy of the Administration within six months. The petitioners failed to comply with the condition, and the estate officer passed an order of ejectment, which was upheld by the court.

The dispute arose when the original allottee of an industrial site in Chandigarh rented it out to the petitioners for purposes other than industrial. The estate officer passed a resumption order, which was challenged by the petitioners in various forums. The matter was remanded back to the highest authority, who set aside the resumption order subject to the condition that the petitioners regularize the misuse in accordance with the conversion policy of the Administration within six months. However, the petitioners failed to comply with the condition, and the estate officer passed an order of ejectment, which was upheld by the court.

The petitioners argued that a notification issued by the Administration in 2006 permitted conversion of land use of industrial sites. However, the court rejected this contention and upheld the order of ejectment. The court held that the petitioners had failed to comply with the condition set by the highest authority, and therefore, the estate officer was justified in passing the order of ejectment.

The second court order states that the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Hazardous Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 1989, as well as the norms of the Chandigarh Pollution control Committee, must be followed for any change in trade or manufacturing activity. However, the petitioners failed to show that they had applied for approval for a change in land use. Therefore, the court dismissed the case.

The court order emphasizes the importance of following the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Hazardous Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 1989, as well as the norms of the Chandigarh Pollution control Committee, for any change in trade or manufacturing activity. The court held that the petitioners had failed to show that they had applied for approval for a change in land use, and therefore, the court dismissed the case.
