The first court order pertains to a property dispute between Sheela Rani, widow of Babu Ram, and Tarlok Chand. Babu Ram had executed a will in favor of Sheela Rani, making her the owner of the property. However, Tarlok Chand, Babu Ram's son, claimed ownership of a portion of the property and refused to vacate it. Sheela Rani filed a suit for mandatory injunction, which was dismissed by the trial court and the first appellate court. She then filed a regular second appeal, questioning the validity of the first appellate court's findings. The court order lists the substantial questions of law that arise in this appeal.

The second court order pertains to a dispute over property ownership. The appellant claimed that her husband had executed a valid will in her favor, making her the owner of the property in question after his death. The respondent disputed the validity of the will. The court found that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the legality and validity of the will, and that there were suspicious circumstances surrounding its execution. The court cited legal precedents to emphasize the importance of proving the legitimacy of a will, particularly when there are suspicious circumstances. Ultimately, the court dismissed the appeal.

The third court order discusses a case involving a disputed will. The court found that the will was not executed properly and was a fabricated document. The plaintiff was found to have forged the will in order to gain control of the deceased's property. The defendant, who was a natural heir of the deceased, was found to be in possession of a portion of the disputed property as a matter of right and not as a licensee. The court upheld the judgments and decrees of the lower courts and dismissed the appeal.
