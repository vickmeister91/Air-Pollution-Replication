The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) by Jaspal Arora against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner had previously filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to call the report submitted by the Superintendent of Police, AJK Bhopal range to the Additional Director General of Police, AJK Bhopal. However, this application was rejected.

The petitioner is currently facing trial for various offences and had wanted the report to be called in the criminal case.
