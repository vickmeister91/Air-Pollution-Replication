The Jammu & Kashmir High Court in Srinagar issued an order on August 13, 2015, in a case involving the selection process for 98 Prosecuting Officers. The second stage of the selection process, the written examination, was challenged on the grounds that many questions were out of syllabus, the syllabus was not strictly adhered to, and the allocation of marks was irrational. The court examined the syllabus and listed the Acts and Laws that were to be covered in the examination. The court also noted that the focus of the examination was on the application of legal knowledge and professional ethics.

The court order discusses the evaluation process for candidates applying for the position of Prosecuting Officer. The Board of Officers evaluated the answer scripts and awarded marks based on the candidates' proficiency in English writing, general awareness, knowledge of law, and latest case laws. The court addressed several questions raised by the petitioners regarding the accuracy of certain questions and answers, and the respondents provided evidence to support their decisions. The court ultimately upheld the evaluation process and the marks awarded to the candidates.

The court order discusses objections raised by candidates regarding the correctness of answers and formulation of questions in a law exam. The court finds that most objections are unfounded and that the exam was conducted fairly. The court declines to interfere with the selection process but allows candidates to raise valid objections in the future.

The court order states that if any favoritism or other valid grounds for questioning the selection process become apparent, the final selection or appointment can be questioned. All petitions related to this matter are disposed of. The order was issued by Judge Mohammad Yaqoob Mir in Srinagar.
