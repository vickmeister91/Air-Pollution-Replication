A recent court order has been issued in a mortgage dispute case between a plaintiff-appellant and eight defendants, including legal representatives of the mortgagor and mortgagee. The lower court had dismissed the claim, stating that the mortgage and sale were bogus and paper transactions. However, the plaintiff-appellant argued that they had proved the genuineness of the mortgage and sale. The court found that the mortgage was executed by the mortgagor and that consideration had passed on the mortgage and sale. As a result, the court allowed the appeal, reversed the lower court's decree, and decreed the claim of the plaintiff for the amount claimed up to the date of the suit, with costs in both courts.
