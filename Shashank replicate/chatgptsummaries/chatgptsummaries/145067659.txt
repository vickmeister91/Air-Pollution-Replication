Bail is a legal term that refers to the release of a person from custody on the condition that they will appear in court when required. Bail is granted to an accused person to ensure that they do not abscond or tamper with evidence. The grant of bail is at the discretion of the court and is based on various factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused absconding, and the likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence.

In the present case, the court considered the nature of the offence and the fact that the applicant had been in jail for a considerable period of time. The court also considered the fact that the applicant had no criminal antecedents. Based on these factors, the court granted him bail.
