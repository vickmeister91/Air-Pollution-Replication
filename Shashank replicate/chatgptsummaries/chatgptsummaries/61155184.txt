The Kerala High Court recently heard several appeals challenging the decisions of various Panchayats (local governments) in India to reject licenses and permits for mining and quarrying operations. In one case, a private limited company had obtained all necessary licenses and permissions from competent authorities, but the Ramapuram Grama Panchayat rejected their application for a license, citing environmental concerns and the potential for ecological imbalance. The court upheld the Panchayat's decision, stating that the company's environmental clearance did not preclude the Panchayat from considering environmental degradation and that the Panchayat had the power to refuse the license.

In another case, a petitioner challenged the decision of a Panchayat to reject a license for a quarry. The Panchayat and respondents 2 to 4 argued that the decision was made in the interest of the people and that the writ petition was not maintainable due to an earlier judgment. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition, quashed the decision, and directed the Panchayat to reconsider the issue and grant a license based on environmental clearance. The appellants argued that the Panchayat's decision should not have been interfered with and that the writ petition was barred by the principle of res judicata. The court cited previous judgments to support the requirement for licenses/permissions under the Panchayat Raj Act and the need for the Panchayat to consider matters such as pollution and density of population.

The court also discussed the circumstances under which a party whose remedy by way of an appeal under the statute is barred by limitation can invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226. The court held that if the writ petition raises issues on which ordinarily relief could not be given by the statutory authority, then the writ petition is maintainable. The court examined the factual issue involved in the matter and found that the Panchayat had exceeded its powers in rejecting the permit/license.

In another case, the court evaluated whether the reasons cited by the Panchayat for not issuing a license for a mining project fell within their jurisdiction under Section 233 of the Act. The report submitted by the Grama Panchayat highlighted various concerns such as non-compliance with conditions, obstruction of natural water flow, possibility of landslides, environmental pollution, and threat to organic diversity. The Panchayat decided not to issue a license for the mining project based on these concerns.

The court also discussed the grant of permission for factories, workshops, and workplaces by the Village Panchayat. No person can construct or establish a factory, workshop, or workplace without permission from the Village Panchayat and in accordance with the specified conditions. The Village Panchayat must consider reports from various authorities before granting or refusing permission. The grant of permission is subject to restrictions and conditions. If any nuisance is caused by a factory, workshop, workplace, or machinery, the Village Panchayat can direct the person in charge to abate the nuisance within a reasonable time.

In another case, a petitioner had obtained environmental clearance and other reports from various authorities, but the Panchayat rejected the permit citing concerns about harm to the environment and local population. The court found that the Panchayat did not have sufficient evidence to reject the permit and that the petitioner's right to carry on business was being infringed. The court dismissed the appeals and upheld the rejection of the permit.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of considering environmental concerns and the potential impact on local populations when granting licenses and permits for mining and quarrying operations. The court also emphasizes the need for Panchayats to consider reports from various authorities and to grant permission subject to restrictions and conditions. Additionally, the court discusses the circumstances under which a party can invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 and the need for Panchayats to consider matters such as pollution and density of population when making decisions.
