Two court orders pertaining to pollution control measures have been issued in India. The first order relates to a chemical industry in Haryana that was directed to be closed by the state pollution control board due to violation of pollution control measures. The industry had challenged the order, but the court found no merit in their arguments and upheld the closure order. The court noted that the industry had earlier given an undertaking to comply with pollution control measures, but failed to do so. The court also rejected the industry's argument that reduced production levels meant that pollution control measures were unnecessary.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition challenging an order to shut down a unit due to pollution. The court directs the Central Pollution Control Board to constitute a sub-committee to inspect the unit and suggest ways to keep emissions and discharge within permissible limits. The sub-committee is to be constituted within one month and complete the process within four weeks. Final orders on the subject are to be passed by the Central Pollution Control Board expeditiously but not later than four weeks from the date the sub-committee submits the report. The unit can re-start its activities provided it satisfies the authority concerned regarding the installation and efficacy of APCM and ETP.

The first court order highlights the importance of complying with pollution control measures. The industry had given an undertaking to comply with these measures, but failed to do so, resulting in the closure order. The court's decision to uphold the closure order sends a strong message to industries that flout pollution control measures. It also emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of these measures to protect the environment and public health.

The second court order is more lenient in its approach. While the unit was initially ordered to shut down due to pollution, the court has directed the Central Pollution Control Board to constitute a sub-committee to inspect the unit and suggest ways to keep emissions and discharge within permissible limits. This approach allows the unit to continue its activities, provided it satisfies the authority concerned regarding the installation and efficacy of APCM and ETP. The court's decision to allow the unit to continue its activities highlights the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection.

Both court orders emphasize the need for strict enforcement of pollution control measures. The first order shows that industries that fail to comply with these measures will face consequences, while the second order shows that leniency can be shown if the unit takes steps to reduce its pollution levels. These court orders are important in protecting the environment and public health, and serve as a reminder to industries to take their environmental responsibilities seriously.
