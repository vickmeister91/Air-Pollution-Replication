In two separate cases, the courts have ruled in favor of mining leaseholders who were facing opposition from the Forest Department. The first case involved M/s. Royal Potteries Ceramic Industries, which had a mining lease agreement with the State Government. However, the Forest Department claimed that the land in question was forest land. The petitioner had won a civil suit in 2012, which granted them the right to carry out excavation work on the land. However, in 2017, the Additional Commissioner, Chandrapur, passed an order asking the petitioner to seek permission from the forest department for carrying out its activity.

The petitioner challenged this order in court, arguing that they had already won a civil suit granting them the right to carry out excavation work on the land. The court, however, ruled that the impugned order was justified as the land allotted to the petitioner was one of the disputed lands in respect of which a proposal seeking exemption was pending. In other words, the Forest Department had not yet decided whether or not to exempt the land from forest use, and until that decision was made, the petitioner could not carry out excavation work without permission.

The second case involved a mining lease granted to a petitioner-firm for 30 years, with the State of Maharashtra supporting their claim. The Forest Department opposed the claim, but the Civil Court granted a decree in favor of the petitioner-firm. The respondents did not challenge this decision, and they had no objection to the use of disputed lands for purposes other than forest purposes. The State Government had even submitted a proposal for de-notification as reserved forest.

Despite this, the Additional Collector passed orders requiring the petitioner-firm to seek permission from the Forest Department for carrying out mining activities. The petitioner-firm challenged these orders in court, arguing that they were not in line with the facts and were unsustainable. The court agreed, setting aside the impugned orders.

These cases highlight the complex legal issues that arise when mining leases are granted on land that is also designated as forest land. While mining can bring economic benefits to the region, it can also have negative environmental impacts, particularly in forested areas. As a result, the Forest Department has a responsibility to ensure that mining activities do not harm the environment or disrupt the ecological balance of the area.

At the same time, mining leaseholders have a legitimate interest in carrying out their activities and generating revenue for themselves and the state. The courts have a difficult task in balancing these competing interests, and their decisions must take into account a range of factors, including environmental concerns, economic benefits, and legal precedents.

In both of these cases, the courts ultimately ruled in favor of the mining leaseholders, but with important caveats. In the first case, the petitioner was required to seek permission from the Forest Department before carrying out excavation work, while in the second case, the impugned orders were set aside as unsustainable. These decisions reflect the courts' efforts to balance the interests of all parties involved and to ensure that mining activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.
