The Gujarat High Court issued a judgment on January 10, 2020, in the case of Air Liquide India Holding Private Limited vs State of Gujarat. The petitioner had filed a petition challenging an order passed by the Collector of Electricity Duty, Gandhinagar, denying exemption from payment of electricity duty under the Gujarat Electricity Duty Act, 1958. The petitioner had established an independent industrial undertaking for the extraction, production, and supply of liquid gases, and had invested approximately Rs. 68 crores for setting up the independent unit. The petitioner sought a certificate of eligibility for exemption of electricity duty under section 3(2)(vii) of the Act, which was denied by the Collector of Electricity Duty. The petitioner challenged this decision in court.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the exemption of electricity duty for a new industrial undertaking established by the petitioner at Jhagadia. The petitioner claimed that they were entitled to exemption for the first five years from the date of commencement of commercial production in the independent unit. However, the application was rejected by respondent no.2, and the petitioner appealed to respondent no.3, who also dismissed the appeal. The matter was then taken to court, and after several hearings and remands, the Division Bench clarified that the observations made by the learned Single Judge on the merits of entitlement for exemption shall not prejudice the rights of either side before the competent authority, and the competent authority shall be at liberty to take an independent view of the matter on the basis of material available before it and in accordance with the law.

The court order states that the observations made by the learned Single Judge on the entitlement for exemption will not affect the rights of either party before the competent authority. The competent authority can take an independent view of the matter based on the available material and in accordance with the law. The petitioner argued that their new unit producing gases in Jhagadia should be eligible for exemption from electricity duty under the provisions of 3(2)(vii) of the Act. They provided various documents to demonstrate that the investment made in the plant and machinery in the unit at Jhagadia are new investments and that none of the assets used at the plants of Gujarat Guardian Limited and E.I. DuPont have been used by the petitioner. The court also referred to the decision in the case of Kores (India) Limited Textile Division v. Collector of Electricity Duty and others to support the petitioner's argument. The court rejected the respondent's argument that the Jhagadia unit is an expansion of the petitioner's existing business and therefore not eligible for exemption. The court also noted that the Act was amended with effect from 1st April 2013, whereby even an additional unit of a company is eligible for exemption from payment of electricity duty with retrospective effect.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioner is seeking exemption from electricity duty under section 3(2)(vii) of the Act. The senior counsel for the petitioner argues that the facts of the case are different from a previous case where the Apex Court did not consider the joint generation of energy as a new industrial undertaking. The court examines the statutory conditions for exemption and notes that they must be strictly construed. The Assistant Government Pleader argues that the petitioner is not eligible for exemption as their Jhagadia unit is an expansion of their existing business. The court examines the supply agreement between the petitioner and E.I. DuPont India Limited and notes that the petitioner owns the plant and machinery required for the FLOXAL SYSTEM. The court also notes that the petitioner's Jhagadia unit is a newly set up industrial undertaking for the production of industrial gases.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the exemption of electricity duty for a gas production unit in Gujarat. The petitioner argued that their unit in Jhagadia was an expansion of their existing business and therefore entitled to the exemption. However, the respondent argued that the unit did not qualify as a new industrial undertaking and was not eligible for the exemption. The court considered various documents and submissions and ultimately held that the unit was not entitled to the exemption.

The court order discusses a case where a petitioner claimed exemption from electricity duty under the provisions of the Act for their new industrial unit at Jhagadia. The court examined the evidence presented and found that the unit was established with new plant and machinery and not by splitting or reconstructing an existing business. The court also found that the machinery used by the petitioner's clients was not used in setting up the Jhagadia unit. However, the respondent wrongly applied a clause to reject the petitioner's claim for exemption. Overall, the court found that the petitioner was eligible for exemption from electricity duty.

The court order states that the petitioner's unit at Jhagadia is not an expansion of their existing unit in Gujarat, as it is completely independent and established without the use of assets from other units. The court refers to previous cases to define the meaning of "expansion" and concludes that the manufacturing activity at Jhagadia for a new product with new technology, machinery, and setup meets the criteria for a new industrial undertaking. The court grants the petitioner exemption from electricity duty.

The court order states that establishing a new unit in Gujarat for a new product using new technology does not disqualify it from duty exemption. However, if the unit is changing technology for the same product, it may not be eligible for exemption. The
