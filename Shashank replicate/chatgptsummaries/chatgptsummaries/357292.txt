In 1986, the State of Haryana granted a mining lease to Aravali Khanij Udyog for silica sand and ordinary sand. However, the lease was terminated by the state government. In 1998, the Central Government restored the lease but directed the lessee to apply for a mining lease for ordinary sand within 30 days. The lessee applied for the lease, which was granted until 2000. 

The lessee then requested an extension of the lease by 850 days, which was rejected by the State Government. The lessee filed a writ petition, which was allowed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. However, the State of Haryana appealed the decision, and the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, stating that the lease had expired, and third-party rights had been created. 

As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, the mining operation in the entire area of Gurgaon District is prohibited. The lessee is free to approach the appropriate court for damages/compensation if permissible by law. 

This case highlights the importance of adhering to the terms and conditions of a lease agreement. The lessee's failure to apply for a mining lease for ordinary sand within the stipulated time frame resulted in the lease expiring. The lessee's request for an extension of the lease was also rejected by the State Government. 

Furthermore, the creation of third-party rights was a crucial factor in the Supreme Court's decision. Third-party rights refer to the rights of individuals or entities who are not parties to a contract but may be affected by it. In this case, the mining lease had expired, and third-party rights had been created, which prevented the lessee from continuing the mining operation. 

The Supreme Court's decision to prohibit mining in the entire area of Gurgaon District has significant implications for the mining industry. It underscores the need for mining companies to comply with lease agreements and adhere to environmental regulations. 

In conclusion, the termination of the mining lease granted to Aravali Khanij Udyog for silica sand and ordinary sand in 1986, the subsequent restoration of the lease, and the lessee's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the lease agreement resulted in the lease expiring. The creation of third-party rights was a crucial factor in the Supreme Court's decision to prohibit mining in the entire area of Gurgaon District. This case highlights the importance of adhering to lease agreements and complying with environmental regulations.
