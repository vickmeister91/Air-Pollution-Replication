The court order pertains to a batch of criminal revisions that were heard together and disposed of by a common order. The case involves allegations of a criminal conspiracy to cheat the South Eastern Coal fields Limited (SECL) by lifting coal through Road Release Orders (RROs) issued against rail shortfalls and selling the coal in the black market for wrongful gain. The accused persons are alleged to have prepared and signed the RROs and despatched the coal.

The learned trial Judge has given adequate reasons for not calling for the documents sought to be requisitioned before the charge was framed. The court held that the determination of the reliability, probability, and credibility of the evidence cannot be done at the stage of framing of charge. The court referred to several decisions to support its ruling that the judge has the power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out.

The court order states that during the initial stages of a trial, the court must evaluate the evidence presented and determine if there is enough evidence to charge the accused with the alleged offense. The court is allowed to sift through the evidence and not accept everything presented by the prosecution as truth. The standard of proof required at the initial stage is not the same as the final stage. The court has discretion in determining whether to proceed with the trial or not. In this particular case, the court found that there was enough evidence to proceed with the trial and dismissed the criminal revisions.
