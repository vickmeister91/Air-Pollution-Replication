The Supreme Court of India recently heard various applications related to the Taj Trapezium Zone and the Taj Mahal. The court advised Ms. Meenakshi Dhote, a professor of environmental planning, to prepare a vision document with the help of experts to ensure the larger picture and interests of the Taj Trapezium Zone and the Taj Mahal are kept in mind. The petitioner, Mr. M.C. Mehta, will provide suggestions and meet with Ms. Dhote as necessary. The matter was listed for further hearing on 25th September 2018.

The Taj Trapezium Zone is a 10,400 sq km area around the Taj Mahal, which includes the districts of Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Hathras, and Etah in Uttar Pradesh and Bharatpur in Rajasthan. The zone was created in 1996 to protect the Taj Mahal from pollution. The court has been hearing a case related to the protection of the Taj Mahal for several years now.

During the hearing, the court also discussed the declaration of Agra as a heritage city and directed the State of U.P. to respond to the Government of India's proposal within a month. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has been directed to file the Management Plan with the World Heritage Centre of UNESCO within three months. The next date of hearing is set for 25.09.2018.

The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic monuments in India. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The monument attracts millions of tourists every year, but it has been facing several environmental and conservation challenges.

The court's decision to involve Ms. Dhote and other experts in preparing a vision document for the Taj Trapezium Zone and the Taj Mahal is a positive step towards addressing these challenges. The document will help ensure that the larger picture and interests of the area are taken into account while making decisions related to the Taj Mahal.

The court's direction to the State of U.P. to respond to the Government of India's proposal to declare Agra as a heritage city is also significant. Agra is home to several other historical monuments besides the Taj Mahal, including the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. Declaring Agra as a heritage city will help in preserving and promoting these monuments.

The court's order directing the ASI to file the Management Plan with the World Heritage Centre of UNESCO within three months is also important. The Management Plan will outline the steps that need to be taken to protect and conserve the Taj Mahal and the surrounding area. It will also help in ensuring that the Taj Mahal retains its World Heritage Site status.

Overall, the court's orders related to the Taj Trapezium Zone and the Taj Mahal are a positive step towards protecting and conserving one of India's most iconic monuments. The involvement of experts in preparing a vision document and the direction to declare Agra as a heritage city will help in preserving the area's historical and cultural heritage. The court's direction to file the Management Plan with UNESCO will help in ensuring that the Taj Mahal retains its World Heritage Site status.
