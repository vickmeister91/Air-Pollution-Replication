The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over the management of schools in Kerala, India. In the first case, the founder of a vocational school had made a family settlement to transfer the management to his son and two other parties, but the fifth respondent allegedly submitted a fabricated letter to transfer the management to himself. A trust was formed with the founder as the settler and the three parties as beneficiaries, but the fifth respondent challenged the trust deed. The court found the trust deed to be valid and issued various orders regarding the management of the school, but the matter is still pending in court.

In the second case, the petitioner and fourth respondent were challenging an order passed by the Director of Public Instruction without notice to the petitioner. The fifth respondent, who was the current manager of the school, argued that the order was unsustainable as it was passed without affording him an opportunity to be heard. The court found that the petitioner should have challenged an earlier order if he had any grievances with it and that the fifth respondent did not raise certain contentions earlier. Therefore, the order passed by the Director of Public Instruction was deemed unsustainable.

The third case discussed a dispute over the management of a school and the validity of a trust deed governing its affairs. The Director of Public Instruction had ordered that the school be managed in accordance with the provisions of the registered deed, and the government had affirmed this decision subject to a pending court case. The court ultimately found that the trust deed was legally binding and that the fifth respondent had continued as manager of the school beyond the permissible period. An earlier order that had questioned the validity of the trust deed was set aside, and the rights of the parties as outlined in the deed were affirmed.

In the fourth case, the petitioners in two cases were to be the manager of the school by rotation for the balance period after deducting one year from the total period during which the first respondent was in office. The three sons were to hold the office of the manager of the school for two years each by rotation. The terms and conditions of the Trust Deed were to be strictly followed, and the fifth respondent was to be the manager for the next two years. The order was subject to the orders to be passed in the appeal filed by the fifth respondent, and all writ petitions were disposed of accordingly.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following legal procedures and adhering to trust deeds in the management of schools. Disputes over management can be complex and lengthy, but ultimately, the court seeks to uphold the rights of all parties involved.
