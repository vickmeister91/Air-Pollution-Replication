In a recent case, a petitioner filed a criminal misc. petition to set aside an order rendered by a Civil Judge in a civil suit. The order allowed a document from the civil suit to be given to an investigating officer for the purpose of investigation. The petitioner argued that the document could not have been handed over without the permission of the High Court. However, the court found that the argument was devoid of any legal force and substance. The court dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to file a criminal revision petition if they wished to do so.

The case involved a dispute between two parties in a civil suit. During the course of the proceedings, one of the parties submitted a document that was relevant to the case. The Civil Judge allowed the document to be given to an investigating officer for the purpose of investigation. The petitioner, who was the other party in the civil suit, filed a criminal misc. petition to set aside the order.

The petitioner argued that the document could not have been handed over without the permission of the High Court. The petitioner contended that the document was confidential and could not be shared with anyone without the permission of the High Court. The petitioner also argued that the order was passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

The court, however, found that the argument was devoid of any legal force and substance. The court held that the document was not confidential and could be shared with an investigating officer for the purpose of investigation. The court also held that the petitioner had been given an opportunity to be heard and had not raised any objections at that time.

The court dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to file a criminal revision petition if they wished to do so. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference in the order passed by the Civil Judge. The court also held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them in the form of a criminal revision petition.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioner to set aside an order rendered by a Civil Judge in a civil suit. The court found that the argument put forth by the petitioner was devoid of any legal force and substance. The court directed the petitioner to file a criminal revision petition if they wished to do so. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference in the order passed by the Civil Judge and that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them in the form of a criminal revision petition.
