The court order in question is related to a petition filed by Rambharosi and another individual against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioners had been convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act and were sentenced to six months imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 500 each. However, the court had allowed for the modification of the sentence, reducing the jail term to the period already served, subject to the condition that the petitioners deposit a fine of Rs. 3000 each within two months.

The petitioners sought an extension of time to deposit the fine, which was granted for a period of 15 days. However, if they fail to deposit the fine within the extended period, the original order will be enforced, and they will have to serve the full six-month jail term.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation in India that aims to protect the country's wildlife and biodiversity. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and wildlife products.

The act has been instrumental in curbing the illegal trade in wildlife and has helped in the conservation of several endangered species. However, the act is also known for its strict penalties, including imprisonment and fines, for those found guilty of violating its provisions.

In this case, the petitioners were found guilty of violating the act and were sentenced to six months imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 500 each. However, the court allowed for the modification of the sentence, reducing the jail term to the period already served, subject to the condition that the petitioners deposit a fine of Rs. 3000 each within two months.

The petitioners sought an extension of time to deposit the fine, which was granted for a period of 15 days. This extension was a significant relief for the petitioners, as it gave them more time to arrange for the funds required to pay the fine.

However, the court made it clear that if the petitioners fail to deposit the fine within the extended period, the original order will be enforced, and they will have to serve the full six-month jail term. This is a stern warning to the petitioners and serves as a reminder of the seriousness of the offense they have been found guilty of.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Rambharosi and another individual against the State of Madhya Pradesh for modification of a previous order. The petitioners had been convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act and were sentenced to six months imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 500 each. The court had allowed for the modification of the sentence, reducing the jail term to the period already served, subject to the condition that the petitioners deposit a fine of Rs. 3000 each within two months. The petitioners sought an extension of time to deposit the fine, which was granted for a period of 15 days. However, if they fail to deposit the fine within the extended period, the original order will be enforced, and they will have to serve the full six-month jail term. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act and the strict penalties for those found guilty of violating its provisions.
