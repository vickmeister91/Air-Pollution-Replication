The case in question involves a petition filed by S.V. Ravichandran under Section 397 read with 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioner sought to set aside an order made in Crl.MP.No.3850 of 2015 in CC.No.160 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur. However, during the proceedings, the petitioner sought permission to withdraw the petition. The court granted this request and dismissed the case as not pressed. The petitioner was given liberty to file a fresh petition in accordance with the law.

During the course of the proceedings, the respondent was directed to furnish fresh legible copies of certain documents to the petitioner's counsel. This was likely done to ensure that both parties had access to the same information and to prevent any unfair advantage from being gained by either side.

It is unclear from the available information what the specific details of the case were, or what the petitioner was seeking to achieve by filing the petition. However, it is clear that the court took the matter seriously and ensured that both parties were given a fair opportunity to present their case.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and ensuring that all parties have access to the same information. It also underscores the need for individuals to seek legal advice and representation when dealing with complex legal matters. By doing so, they can ensure that their rights are protected and that they are able to achieve a fair and just outcome.
