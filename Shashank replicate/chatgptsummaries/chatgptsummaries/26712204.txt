The court has granted anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar, a Junior Engineer under the Rural Works Department, Koderma, in connection with a forest conservation case. The petitioner's duty was to look after the construction of the road, and he was least concerned with the boulders brought by the contractor from the forest area. The court ordered his release on bail on furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Koderma, within three weeks from the date of the order.

The case in question pertains to the illegal extraction of boulders from a forest area for the construction of a road. Ashok Kumar, as the Junior Engineer in charge of the project, was accused of neglecting his duty and allowing the contractor to extract boulders from the forest area without proper permission. The forest department had filed a case against him under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

Ashok Kumar had applied for anticipatory bail in the court, fearing arrest in the case. The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, granted him anticipatory bail on the condition that he furnishes a bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Koderma, within three weeks from the date of the order.

The court observed that Ashok Kumar was not directly involved in the illegal extraction of boulders from the forest area. His duty was limited to the construction of the road, and he was not responsible for the procurement of raw materials. The court also noted that the forest department had not named him as an accused in the FIR, and he was only summoned for questioning.

The court further observed that the grant of anticipatory bail would not hamper the investigation in any way. The court directed Ashok Kumar to cooperate with the investigating agency and appear before them whenever required. The court also warned him not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar has come as a relief to him, as he was facing the prospect of arrest in the case. The court's decision has also set a precedent for similar cases in the future. It has clarified that the mere fact of being a government official does not make one automatically liable for the actions of others. The court has emphasized the need for a clear distinction between the duties of different officials and their respective responsibilities.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar in the forest conservation case is a welcome move. It has upheld the principle of natural justice and ensured that an innocent person is not subjected to unnecessary harassment. The court's observations on the duties and responsibilities of government officials are also noteworthy and will have far-reaching implications in similar cases.
