One of the cases consolidated in the court order pertains to Smt. Sati Tripura, owner of Sati Bricks Industry, who challenged the order of closure issued by the Tripura State Pollution Control Board.

The court observed that an appellate authority exists for filing appeals against such orders and directed the petitioners to file appeals within 30 days. The court also granted the Pollution Control Board two months to ensure compliance with relevant laws and directed them to file a status report.
