In a recent court order, the applicant, who had been convicted for possessing the skin of a wild animal, had filed a revision against the judgment. The court partially allowed the revision, maintaining the conviction but reducing the sentence to the period already served in custody. The applicant had already paid the fine, and as a result, the court discharged their bail bonds.

The case in question involved the possession of the skin of a wild animal, which is a violation of wildlife protection laws. The applicant had been convicted and sentenced to one year's imprisonment with a fine. However, they had filed a revision against the judgment, seeking a reduction in the sentence.

The court, after considering the revision, maintained the conviction but reduced the sentence to the period already served in custody. This means that the applicant would not have to serve any additional time in prison, as they had already completed the sentence. The court also noted that the applicant had already paid the fine, which was another factor in their decision to reduce the sentence.

As a result of the court's decision, the applicant's bail bonds were discharged. This means that any sureties or guarantors who had posted bail on behalf of the applicant would no longer be responsible for ensuring their appearance in court. Additionally, the court ordered a copy of the order to be sent to both the lower courts, which would ensure that the revised sentence was properly recorded and enforced.

Overall, the court's order in this case reflects a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances involved. While the conviction was maintained, the court recognized that the applicant had already served a significant portion of their sentence and had paid the fine. By reducing the sentence to the period already served in custody, the court ensured that justice was served while also taking into account the applicant's circumstances.
