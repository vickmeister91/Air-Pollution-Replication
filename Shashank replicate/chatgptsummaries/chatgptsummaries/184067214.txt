The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and its various amendments. The Act was enacted to protect wild animals, birds, and plants, and the Indian elephant was brought under its purview in 1977. In 1991, a total prohibition on trade of imported ivory was imposed, and the Act was brought into force in 1992. The court orders address the constitutionality and validity of the Act and its amendments, as well as the penalties for violating the Act.

In one case, the Indian Handicrafts Emporium and others were engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling articles made from ivory imported from African countries. The appellants filed writ petitions questioning the constitutionality and validity of the 1991 Amendment Act prohibiting trade in imported ivory. The High Court upheld the vires of the Act, and the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

In another case, the court discusses the definition of "scheduled animal" and "specified date" as well as the penalties for violating the Act. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting wild animals and the environment and notes that trade in wild animals can be regulated or prohibited if it is deemed dangerous to ecology. The court also addresses the constitutionality of the Act and the government's power to sell exclusive privileges.

In a third case, the court discusses the constitutionality of the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2003, which bans the possession of ivory in India. The court cites previous cases and constitutional provisions to argue that the protection and preservation of wildlife is in the public interest and that the ban on ivory trade is a reasonable restriction. The court also notes that India is not obligated to make laws only in accordance with international treaties and conventions and that the ban on ivory trade is necessary to prevent poaching and illegal trade.

In a fourth case, the court upholds the constitutionality of the Amending Acts that prohibit trade in ivory and other animal articles. The court rejects the argument that the definition of wild animal is vague and that the Amending Acts provide arbitrary power. The court also states that the doctrine of 'res extra commercium' cannot be invoked in this case.

In a fifth case, the court discusses the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act in relation to the possession and trade of ivory imported into India. It states that while trade or commerce in ivory is completely prohibited, a person carrying on a business or occupation dealing in trophies, animal articles, etc. derived from scheduled animals is entitled to file a declaration disclosing their stocks of ivory imported into India or articles made therefrom.

In a sixth case, the court discusses the limited scope of judicial review in administrative action, the applicability of the doctrine of proportionality in administrative law, and the importance of interpreting statutes in context. The court also applies the doctrine of purposive construction to a case involving possession of animal articles and concludes that the appellants have no right to possess the articles in question.

Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of protecting wild animals and the environment, and the need to read all the provisions of the Act in their entirety and apply principles of purposive construction to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and phrases employed. The court also upholds the constitutionality of the Act and its amendments, and emphasizes the need to regulate or prohibit trade in wild animals if it is deemed dangerous to ecology.
