The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving allegations of forgery, fraud, and cheating. In the first order, the petitioners had filed a bail application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail in FIR No. 12/2015 under Section 419/420/467/468/471/506/120B IPC registered at P.S. New Friends Colony. The case involved allegations of cheating and conspiracy against the petitioners, who were accused of forging documents related to the purchase of agricultural land in Sohna, Haryana, and cheating the complainant out of a substantial amount of money. The court was urged to deny bail to the petitioners and allow for their custodial interrogation to complete the investigation. The court also noted that the statements of co-accused suggest that the petitioners were the masterminds of the conspiracy.

In the second order, two bail applications were filed by the accused in a case involving allegations of forgery and fraud. The court noted that the police report suggested that the accused were the masterminds of the transactions and beneficiaries of the fraud. The accused denied the allegations and claimed that the complainant had forged documents to implicate them. The court observed that the case was serious and involved allegations of large-scale forgery. The court also noted that both parties had made allegations against each other for forging documents. The court reserved its order on the bail applications.

The third court order discussed a case where the complainant alleged that the petitioners had forged documents and received Rs. 10 crores in cash from the complainant and his wife. The petitioners denied the allegations and claimed that the documents were forged. Both parties did not have the original documents. The court had to decide whether the petitioners were entitled to relief or if their custodial interrogation was required. The court cited previous cases regarding anticipatory bail and emphasized the discretionary nature of the power to grant it.

The fourth court order discussed the guidelines for granting or refusing anticipatory bail, stating that no inflexible guidelines could be provided and that each case should be evaluated based on its own circumstances. The court also listed factors to consider when dealing with anticipatory bail, such as the nature of the accusation, the antecedents of the accused, and the possibility of tampering with evidence. The court emphasized that arrest should be the last option and that custodial interrogation was a form of torture. The court also noted that the issue of cash payments made by the complainant to the petitioners was a subject for trial and that the complainant had failed to disclose the source of a cash amount of Rs. 10 crores allegedly paid to the petitioners. The court expressed doubt about the investigation in the case and suggested that it may need to be conducted by an expert body.

In the fifth court order, two bail applications (No. 145/2015 and No. 146/2015) were filed by petitioners who claimed that their names were inserted in an FIR to put pressure on them. The court allowed the bail applications without expressing any opinion on merit and directed that the petitioners be released on bail subject to certain conditions, including appearing for investigation if required, providing their current address and contact number to the investigating officer, surrendering their passports, and not leaving the country without permission from the court. The court warned that any violation of these conditions may result in the cancellation of bail.

In summary, these court orders all dealt with cases involving allegations of forgery, fraud, and cheating. The courts considered various factors when deciding whether to grant anticipatory bail, including the nature of the accusation, the antecedents of the accused, and the possibility of tampering with evidence. The courts also emphasized the discretionary nature of the power to grant anticipatory bail and the importance of avoiding custodial interrogation unless absolutely necessary. In some cases, the courts expressed doubt about the investigation and suggested that an expert body may need to conduct further investigation.
