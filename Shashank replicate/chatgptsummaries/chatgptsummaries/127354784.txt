In a recent court order, the petitioner, Surender Kumar, requested to withdraw from the petition and the court granted the request. The case was also tagged with another case titled M.C. Mehta v. UOI & Ors. in re: Kant Enclave Matters.

The court order was issued in response to a petition filed by Surender Kumar. The details of the petition are not clear from the court order, but it appears that Kumar had requested some relief from the court. However, for reasons that are not specified, Kumar later decided to withdraw from the petition.

The court granted Kumar's request to withdraw from the petition, which effectively ended the case. It is not clear whether Kumar was granted any relief before he withdrew from the petition, or whether the court simply dismissed the case.

In addition to granting Kumar's request to withdraw, the court also tagged the case with another case titled M.C. Mehta v. UOI & Ors. in re: Kant Enclave Matters. This means that the two cases will be heard together, and any decision made in one case will also apply to the other.

The case titled M.C. Mehta v. UOI & Ors. in re: Kant Enclave Matters is a well-known case that has been ongoing for several years. The case involves the illegal construction of buildings in the Kant Enclave area of Delhi, which is a protected forest area. The case has been heard by various courts over the years, and has resulted in several orders being issued to demolish the illegal constructions.

The decision to tag the case filed by Surender Kumar with the Kant Enclave case is significant, as it suggests that the two cases may be related in some way. It is not clear from the court order what the connection between the two cases is, but it is possible that Kumar's petition also relates to the illegal construction in the Kant Enclave area.

Overall, the court order granting Surender Kumar's request to withdraw from the petition and tagging the case with the Kant Enclave case is a relatively minor development in the ongoing legal battle over the illegal construction in the Kant Enclave area. However, it is possible that the connection between the two cases could lead to further developments in the future.
