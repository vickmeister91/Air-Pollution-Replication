The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the State Pollution Control Board and its use of bank guarantees to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. In one case, the Board had issued closure notices to two companies, M/S Swastik Ispat Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Patnaik Steel & Alloys Ltd., for failing to comply with pollution control regulations. The appeals were disposed of together as they raised similar legal questions. The Board had introduced the bank guarantee system in 2003, which required defaulting industries to furnish a bank guarantee of a stipulated amount for implementing an action plan to meet pollution control standards. If the industry failed to comply within the timeframe, the amount of the bank guarantee would be forfeited. The appeals concerned the legality of the bank guarantee system and the closure notices issued by the Board.

In another case, an industry had furnished a performance bank guarantee for non-compliance with environmental regulations but later challenged the Board's decision to forfeit it. The Board argued that it had the power to ask for a bank guarantee as a financial tool to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The industry argued that the Board did not have the power to ask for a bank guarantee and that the encashment of the guarantee was not in accordance with the terms of the guarantee. The court ultimately upheld the Board's decision to forfeit the bank guarantee.

In yet another case, a non-compliant industrial unit was required to furnish a bank guarantee to the State Board to achieve compliance with environmental standards. The unit had been granted consent to operate but had not fully complied with the conditions. The Board had inspected the unit multiple times and found deficiencies in its compliance. The industry had requested extensions of time to complete the necessary work, but the Board had decided to invoke the bank guarantee. The court order provides details of the inspections and the industry's non-compliance with the prescribed standards.

The court orders also discuss the functions and powers of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Boards in preventing, controlling, and abating air pollution in India. The CPCB is responsible for coordinating activities, providing training, collecting data, and laying down air quality standards. The State Boards advise the government on the suitability of industrial locations and inspect air pollution control areas. The Air Act requires every state government to declare air pollution control areas, and the Board has the power to issue directions, including closure or regulation of industries, to ensure compliance with the Act. The order emphasizes the importance of prevention and control of pollution and the need to construe the powers of the Board liberally to achieve the Act's objectives.

The court orders also discuss the distinction between penalty and compensation in environmental law. It states that compensatory relief is intended to provide equal value for losses sustained, while penalties are punitive in nature. The order also discusses the power of expert bodies to provide opportunities for compliance before taking harsher steps, such as closure. The court concludes that the imposition of a bank guarantee as a condition for compliance is not penal in nature and is permissible under the regulatory regime of the Air Act.

The court orders limit the options available to statutory authorities to ensure compliance with provisions but allow for specific directions and the requirement of a guarantee to remedy harm caused by non-compliance. The court heavily relied on the wide scope of regulatory powers. The power to issue directions under Section 16 of the DCEPT Act is vested in the appropriate Authority while the punitive and penal consequences stated under Sections 17 and 18 of that Act are not vested in the Board. The court rejected the plea that the direction for furnishing of the bank guarantee was punitive or penal. The respondent company was required to comply with conditions and furnish a bank guarantee to operate, and failure to comply would have resulted in closure under Section 31A of the Air Act. The industry repeatedly failed to comply with conditions and was warned that the bank guarantee would be forfeited and renewal of consent would not be granted if the needful was not done.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the State Pollution Control Board and its use of bank guarantees to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The court orders emphasize the importance of prevention and control of pollution and the need to construe the powers of the Board liberally to achieve the Act's objectives. The court orders also discuss the distinction between penalty and compensation in environmental law and the power of expert bodies to provide opportunities for compliance before taking harsher steps, such as closure. The court orders limit the options available to statutory authorities to ensure compliance with provisions but allow for specific directions and the requirement of a guarantee to remedy harm caused by non-compliance.
