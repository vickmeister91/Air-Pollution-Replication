The court order pertains to a dispute over the ownership of a piece of land that was sold by the 7th respondent to other parties. The land in question was originally assigned to political sufferers and was subsequently sold to the appellant through a registered sale deed, which was subsequently cancelled by the Government. The appellant challenged the resumption order on the grounds of jurisdiction and lack of notice. However, the court found that the appellant had no locus standi to question the resumption proceedings, as the same is only between the original assignee and the government.

The appellant argued that the cancellation was done behind their back and that the purchaser should have been put on notice before effecting cancellation of the assignment. However, the court held that the original assignee having violated the conditions of assignment, the competent authority had passed the cancellation order and the assignee having not been impleaded as a party, the petitioner has no locus standi. The court also rejected the appellant's arguments regarding violation of natural justice and the validity of the death certificate produced by the appellant.

The court dismissed a writ petition filed by T. Rajam @ Kaveri Kutty, upholding the order passed by the Government in respect of the vesting of lands to the share of the respective respondents. The court held that title to the land in dispute cannot be decided in the writ court. The sale executed in favor of the appellant is deemed void, and they have no right to question the resumption of the land. The writ appeal is dismissed, and there is no order as to costs.

Furthermore, the court order states that there is no evidence linking the deceased Radhakrishnan to the lands assigned by the government, and the death certificate produced is not sufficient to prove ownership. The appellant's case is weakened by the fact that they did not implead the legal heirs of Radhakrishnan. The court also questions the grant of patta in favor of the 7th respondent for survey No.164/1, as there is no record of their title to the land.

In summary, the court order deals with a dispute over the ownership of a piece of land that was originally assigned to political sufferers and subsequently sold to the appellant. The government had cancelled the sale deed due to a violation of the conditions of assignment, and the appellant challenged the resumption order on the grounds of jurisdiction and lack of notice.
