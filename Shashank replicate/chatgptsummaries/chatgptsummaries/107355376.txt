The State of Bihar filed an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against an order passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Biharsharif, Nalanda, rejecting the State's application for summoning witnesses and certified copies of Customer Acquisition Forms (CAFs) and Call Detail Records (CDRs) of mobile telephone applications. The State argued that the examination of nodal officers of the service providers of the ten mobile phones and the production of the original certificates of nodal officers of service providers is essential in view of Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act. The opposite parties contested the matter, arguing that the prosecution's application was an abuse of the process of law and that the trial court committed no error in dismissing and rejecting the petition. The court held that the trial court has ample power to summon any person as a witness or recall or re-examine any such evidence even if the evidence of both the sides is closed and arguments have been advanced if evidence was not adduced properly or a relevant material was not brought on record due to any inadvertence as function of the criminal court is administration of criminal justice.

The court order describes a criminal case in which a woman was allegedly raped by a man and several others. The case was initially registered under Sections 376 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, but additional charges were added during the investigation. The prosecution presented 19 witnesses and the defense presented 15 witnesses. During the trial, the prosecution filed an application to call four nodal officers of different service providers as witnesses and to prove original CAFs and CDRs of ten mobile phones seized from the accused and related persons under Section 311 of the Cr. P.C., which was rejected by the trial court. The court discusses the admissibility of electronic records under Sections 65A and 65B of the Indian Evidence Act.

The court order discusses the admissibility of electronic records as evidence in court proceedings. It outlines the conditions that must be met for electronic records to be admissible, including that the information must have been regularly fed into the computer, the computer must have been operating properly, and the information must reproduce or be derived from the original information. The order also explains the process for providing a certificate to verify the authenticity of the electronic record. Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act allows for the contents of electronic records to be admissible in court without the need for original production, provided certain conditions are met.

The court order discusses the conditions for admissibility of electronic records as evidence in court, specifically the requirements of Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act. The court emphasizes the mandatory nature of these requirements and notes that compliance with them is necessary for any electronic evidence to be admissible in its secondary form. The court also discusses the discretionary authority of the criminal court under Section 311 of the Cr. P.C. to summon witnesses or recall and re-examine them if their evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the case. The court cites previous Supreme Court decisions on the interpretation of Section 311 and emphasizes that the power of the court under this section has not been curtailed.

The court order discusses the power of the court under Section 311 of the CrPC to summon and examine or recall and re-examine any witness if their evidence appears to be essential to the decision of the case. The court must exercise this power judiciously and not arbitrarily, and only if the evidence is germane to the issue involved and essential to the just decision of the case. Fair trial is the main object of criminal procedure, and the court must ensure that the interests of the accused, the victim, and society are protected. The court must be zealous in ensuring that the rules of procedure are followed to ensure justice.

The court order emphasizes the importance of following procedures to ensure justice and the court's duty to prevent any breaches. It cites various Supreme Court decisions to explain the power of Section 311 Cr. P.C. to summon witnesses or recall and re-examine them, but only if their evidence is essential to the just decision of the case and does not cause prejudice to the accused or allow the prosecution to fill up lacunae. The court also discusses Section 91 of the Cr. P.C., which allows the court to summon documents or other things if necessary or desirable for the case. The order concludes that electronic evidence without a certificate in terms of Section 65-B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act is inadmissible and that the prosecution failed to prove the original CAFs and CDRs or provide any such certificate.

The court order states that the prosecution did not follow the proper procedure for presenting electronic evidence in a case, but the court believes that this was due to confusion and misunderstanding of the law. The court orders that the nodal officers of the mobile service providers be summoned to provide the necessary evidence, and that the prosecution be given the opportunity to prove the electronic evidence in accordance with the law. The court also emphasizes the importance of giving the defense an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and evidence presented.

In summary, the court order discusses the admissibility of electronic records as evidence in court proceedings and the conditions that must be met for electronic records to be admissible. The court emphasizes the mandatory nature of these requirements and notes that compliance with them is necessary for any electronic evidence to be admissible in its secondary form. The court also
