The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Vijay Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication.

The court issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In another court order, the State was directed to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from the canal and its distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court also requested records from the High Court of Rajasthan and ordered the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date. The State was warned that a cost of Rs. 50,000/- would be imposed if they failed to submit the plans and action report. The court later ordered the State to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The State was directed to furnish copies of all compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order dated 10th September 2015 considered the issue of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and directed the State Government to remove all encroachments within one month. The District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust were directed to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered the State to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The Chief Engineer, Water Resources was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The State Government was also directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies.

In a subsequent court order, the court has ordered for an affidavit from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources to provide complete details regarding the action taken by the government in compliance with the tribunal's directions. The court has given the Counsel for the State another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The District Collector, Ganga Nagar has been directed to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court has suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to the environment. The court has also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that the remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal has committed an error that cannot be cured by other statutory remedies. However, the doctrine of availability of alternative remedy may be ignored if the inferior court or tribunal acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the proceedings of a writ in a manner that is contrary to the rules of natural justice. The petitioner seeks a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction. The court concludes that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is efficacious to meet the injury, if any caused to the petitioner, and if that involves any ground as required to invoke Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court dismisses the writ petition with the liberty to the petitioner(s) to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the removal of encroachments and contamination from the canal and its distributories. The court has issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.
