The case in question involves a petitioner named Vijay Singh Kulhari who filed an application under Section 91 read with Section 311 Cr.P.C. to call for a copy of an agreement and recall the complainant for cross-examination. However, the application was dismissed by the learned Magistrate and the revision petition was dismissed by the learned Judge.

Following this, the petitioner filed a petition before the Court, but it was dismissed as the agreement was deemed irrelevant to the controversy before the trial court. The Court also stated that a revision petition does not lie against an interlocutory order.

To understand the implications of this case, it is important to first understand the legal concepts at play. Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the power of the Court to order production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the Court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person already examined.

In this case, the petitioner sought to call for a copy of an agreement and recall the complainant for cross-examination under these provisions. However, the application was dismissed by the learned Magistrate and the revision petition was dismissed by the learned Judge.

The petitioner then filed a petition before the Court, but it was dismissed as the agreement was deemed irrelevant to the controversy before the trial court. The Court also stated that a revision petition does not lie against an interlocutory order.

An interlocutory order is an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and does not finally dispose of the case. It is an order that is passed to regulate the proceedings of the case and to ensure that the case is conducted in a fair and just manner. A revision petition is a petition that is filed before a higher court against an order passed by a lower court.

In this case, the Court held that the agreement sought by the petitioner was irrelevant to the controversy before the trial court. This means that the agreement was not necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial and therefore, the Court did not have the power to order its production under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The Court also held that a revision petition does not lie against an interlocutory order. This means that the petitioner could not file a revision petition against the order passed by the learned Magistrate dismissing his application under Section 91 read with Section 311 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of understanding the legal concepts at play when filing applications or petitions before a court. It is important to ensure that the application or petition is relevant to the controversy before the court and that the appropriate legal provisions are invoked. Additionally, it is important to understand the limitations of the court's powers and the scope of the remedies available under the law.
