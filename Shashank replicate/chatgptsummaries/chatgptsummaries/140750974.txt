The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the quashing of a notice issued by respondent No. 5 to produce a vehicle. The petitioner had argued that the notice was illegal and without jurisdiction, and had requested that it be quashed.

The court, however, ruled that respondent No. 5 did have the power to summon the vehicle under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. This section allows for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

However, the court also noted that while respondent No. 5 had the power to summon the vehicle, they must comply with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Cr.P.C. while doing so. This chapter deals with the process to be followed in the case of search and seizure, and includes provisions for the issuance of search warrants and the conduct of searches.

The court's ruling thus clarified that while respondent No. 5 had the power to summon the vehicle, they must do so in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Cr.P.C. This would ensure that the rights of the petitioner and any other parties involved in the matter were protected, and that the investigation or inquiry proceeded in a lawful and fair manner.

In light of this ruling, the court disposed of the petition with the direction that respondent No. 5 must comply with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Cr.P.C. while summoning the vehicle. This direction would serve as a reminder to all law enforcement agencies and officials that they must follow due process and adhere to the law while carrying out their duties.
