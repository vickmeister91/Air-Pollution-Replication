The Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to four petitioners who were apprehending their arrest in a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, Indian Forest Act, Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, Air (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, and Environment (Protection) Act. The case was related to the seizure of two kgs of stone chips, but no crusher machine was seized, which raised doubts about the accusation made by the informant.

The petitioners had approached the court seeking anticipatory bail, as they feared that they would be arrested in connection with the case. The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The court observed that the seizure of two kgs of stone chips was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the petitioners, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were involved in any illegal mining activity.

The court also noted that the informant had not provided any specific information about the involvement of the petitioners in the alleged illegal mining activity. The court further observed that the seizure of stone chips alone could not be considered as sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the petitioners.

The court, while granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners, imposed certain conditions. The petitioners were released on anticipatory bail on the condition of furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jehanabad, within a period of 12 weeks from the date of the order.

The court also directed the petitioners to cooperate with the investigating agency and to appear before the investigating officer as and when required. The court further directed the petitioners not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to four petitioners who were apprehending their arrest in a case related to illegal mining activity. The court observed that the seizure of two kgs of stone chips was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the petitioners, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were involved in any illegal mining activity. The court, while granting anticipatory bail, imposed certain conditions on the petitioners, including the furnishing of a bail bond and cooperation with the investigating agency.
