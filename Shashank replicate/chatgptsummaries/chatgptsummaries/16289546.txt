The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the court in relation to private and public sector banks and the applicability of writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court clarifies that while private law functions of private bodies cannot be challenged under Article 226, their public law functions can be subject to writ jurisdiction. The court also explains the difference between public law and private law and the types of bodies that fall under each category. The court further discusses the use of mandamus and certiorari as public law remedies and their applicability to private bodies. The court concludes that a writ of mandamus can be issued for statutory violation by a private body, including private banks.

The court order states that private companies engaged in commercial activities, such as banking, are not typically subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution unless they violate statutory provisions. Private companies carrying out banking activities are not considered institutions carrying out public duties, and their service conditions are not governed by statutory regulations. The court also notes that the service conditions of employees of companies or societies governed by bye-laws or provisions that do not have the force of law are in the nature of a contract and cannot be enforced through writ proceedings. The court also clarifies that private scheduled banks are not considered a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and do not perform public functions. The court also notes that a previous decision on a matter in issue is binding on both parties and cannot be reopened.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the SARFAESI Act and the availability of alternative remedies for aggrieved parties. The court held that an agreement of sale is not prohibited by Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act and that the existence of an alternative remedy does not necessarily bar the invocation of writ jurisdiction. However, the court also noted that the power of judicial review and/or superintendence should be exercised in exceptional cases and that the High Court should keep in mind the rule of self-imposed restraint while exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also held that the requirement of pre-deposit under sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act is mandatory and that the deposit is a condition precedent for preferring an appeal under the said section. The court ultimately dismissed the review petition.
