The National Green Tribunal recently heard a case brought by the Nasik Fly Ash Bricks Association against the Ministry of Environment and Forest and other respondents for failing to effectively implement notifications related to fly ash utilization, resulting in inadequate utilization of fly ash and over-exploitation of natural topsoil. The applicant pressed for three prayers, including directing the respondents to implement the MoEF Notification Dated 3rd November 2009 and banning the use of red clay bricks wherever thermal power stations are set up. The MoEF filed an affidavit dealing with various notifications issued on the subject of fly ash utilization.

The court order discusses the issue of fly ash generated by thermal power plants and the government's notification regarding its utilization. The court examines whether the power plants are complying with the notification and if there is an adequate enforcement and monitoring mechanism in place. The court summarizes the important aspects of the notification and its amendments, including the obligation of power plants to make ash available for manufacturing ash-based products and the requirement for construction agencies to use fly ash bricks or blocks. The court also notes the role of the State Pollution Control Board in ensuring compliance with the notification.

The court finds it difficult to identify the agency responsible for enforcing the utilization of fly ash at the power plant level. The court concludes that the Ministry of Environment, Central Pollution Control Board, and State Pollution Control Board are responsible for enforcing the notification. However, the court notes that there have been no efforts or actions taken by these agencies for effective enforcement of the notification. The court also finds that there is a lack of seriousness, apathy, and negligence on the part of all enforcement agencies in enforcing and regulating the utilization of fly ash at the demand site. The court also discusses the arguments made by the respondents regarding the distribution of fly ash and the variability of market demand and supply of bricks.

The court order states that the legality of a notification is not up for challenge in the present application. The court also clarifies that a previous judgment from the Madras High Court does not have a binding effect on the current case. The court partially allows the application with certain directions, including maintaining records of fly ash generation and utilization, conducting joint inspections, and taking measures for disposal and utilization of fly ash. The respondents are also required to publish information related to fly ash use and pay a cost to the applicant.

The court order also discusses a dispute over the sale of dry fly ash by Thermal Power Plants. The Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 argue that they have the authority to decide how much free fly ash they will distribute and that the Central Government exceeded its powers by giving directions to provide fly ash free of cost. They also argue that the National Green Tribunal Act does not give the NGT jurisdiction over the issues raised in the present Application. The court rejects these arguments and states that the NGT has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The court also distinguishes the present case from a previous case involving the Tamil Nadu Power Generation and Distribution Corporation Ltd.

The court order states that pond ash should be made available free of charge to manufacturers of bricks, blocks or tiles, farmers, road construction agencies, and agencies engaged in backfilling or stowing of mines. At least 20% of dry ESP fly ash should be made available free of charge to units manufacturing fly ash or clay-fly ash bricks, blocks, and tiles on a priority basis over other users. The State Government level monitoring committee is responsible for monitoring and facilitating implementation of this Notification. The Respondent Nos.2 and 3 have taken various initiatives to increase fly ash utilization. The court also mentions a policy decision taken by Mahagenco regarding 20% fly ash allocation to the units manufacturing fly ash or clay-fly ash bricks, blocks, and tiles at thermal plants of Mahagenco. The court also refers to a judgment by the Hon'ble High Court Judicature at Madras regarding providing fly ash on a free basis to various units as stipulated in the notification.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of effective implementation and enforcement of notifications related to fly ash utilization. The court emphasizes the role of various agencies, including the Ministry of Environment, Central Pollution Control Board, and State Pollution Control Board, in ensuring compliance with the notification. The court also directs the respondents to take measures for disposal and utilization of fly ash and to publish information related to fly ash use. The court's decision is a step towards promoting sustainable development and protecting the environment.
