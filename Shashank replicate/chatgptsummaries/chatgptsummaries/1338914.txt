The case in question is an appeal against a judgment and order passed by the learned Magistrate First Class, Sub-Ordinate District Council Court, Aizawl in Money Suit No. 15 of 2001, which was affirmed by judgment and order passed by the District Council Court, Aizawl in R.F.A. Case No. 23 of 2001. The respondent had filed a suit against the appellant for the recovery of a loan of Rs. 90,000/- and Rs. 50,000/- with an agreed interest rate of 10% per month. The appellant failed to present her written statement, and the suit was decreed ex-parte for the recovery of the principal amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- along with an equal amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- as interest, thereby decreeing the suit for the recovery of Rs. 2,80,000/-.

The appellant challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of the trial court, raising several grounds along with a prayer for remanding the case for retrial. The appellate court upheld the judgment of the trial court, and the appellant filed the present appeal. The court found that there was no evidence of any kind upon which the case was decided by the learned trial court. The interest claimed was 10% per month, which was irrational and unacceptable to the sense of equity and good conscience. The court held that the suit is required to be sent down to the trial court for trial afresh after giving appropriate opportunity to the defendant-appellant.

The court order states that a judgment must be based on reasons and not arbitrary action. The appellate court did not provide reasons for rejecting the submission made by the appellant's counsel, which is considered improper and illegal. Therefore, the appeal is allowed, and the judgments and orders of the lower courts are set aside. The case is sent back to the trial court with a direction to give the appellant an opportunity to present her written statement and decide the suit in accordance with the law. The parties are directed to appear before the trial court within 30 days, and the defendant must present her written statement within the next 30 days. The court also requests the prompt return of the LCR's.

In summary, the case involves a loan dispute between the respondent and the appellant, with an agreed interest rate of 10% per month. The appellant failed to present her written statement, and the suit was decreed ex-parte for the recovery of the principal amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- along with an equal amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- as interest, thereby decreeing the suit for the recovery of Rs. 2,80,000/-.
