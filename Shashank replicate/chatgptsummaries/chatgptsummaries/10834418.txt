The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a criminal petition filed by Mr. Manohar D. Chatlani against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had sought to quash an order passed by the Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Doddaballapura, taking cognizance of the offences under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and issuing summons to the petitioner.

The court found that the investigation had been done by a Range Forest Officer who was not authorized to do so under the Act. The court observed that the investigation was conducted by the Range Forest Officer without any authorization from the Chief Wildlife Warden or any other authorized officer under the Act. The court held that the investigation conducted by the Range Forest Officer was illegal and without jurisdiction.

The court further observed that the investigation conducted by the Range Forest Officer was in violation of the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court noted that Section 55 of the Act provides that no person shall investigate any offence under the Act except an officer authorized by the State Government. The court held that the investigation conducted by the Range Forest Officer was in contravention of the provisions of the Act and was therefore illegal.

The court also observed that the summons issued by the learned Magistrate was based on the investigation conducted by the Range Forest Officer. Since the investigation was illegal, the summons issued by the learned Magistrate was also illegal. The court held that the order taking cognizance of the offences under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and issuing summons to the petitioner was liable to be set aside.

The court directed the learned Magistrate to issue proper orders to investigate and submit a report in accordance with the law. The court held that the investigation should be conducted by an officer authorized by the State Government under the Act. The court also directed the learned Magistrate to ensure that the investigation is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court set aside the order taking cognizance of the offences under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and issuing summons to the petitioner. The court held that the investigation conducted by the Range Forest Officer was illegal and without jurisdiction. The court directed the learned Magistrate to issue proper orders to investigate and submit a report in accordance with the law. The court also directed the learned Magistrate to ensure that the investigation is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
