The National Green Tribunal recently heard an application filed by Shri N. Purushothaman against several respondents, including the Commissioner Corporation of Salem, the District Collector of Salem, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the District Engineer of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and Mr. Ramamoorthy. The applicant sought a direction against the respondents to consider his representation in respect of the running of the Yarn Twisting unit run by the 5th respondent in his business place.

The Pollution Control Board had passed the consent order on 6.8.2013, and the 5th respondent had produced a copy of the original consent order. The application was disposed of with certain directions.

The case revolves around the operation of a Yarn Twisting unit run by the 5th respondent in his business place. The applicant, Shri N. Purushothaman, had filed an application seeking a direction against the respondents to consider his representation in respect of the running of the unit. The Pollution Control Board had passed a consent order on 6.8.2013, and the 5th respondent had produced a copy of the original consent order.

The National Green Tribunal heard the application and disposed of it with certain directions. The exact nature of these directions is not specified in the available information.

It is important to note that the National Green Tribunal is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and issues. It was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, and its jurisdiction extends to the whole of India.

The case highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the role of specialized courts in enforcing them. The Pollution Control Board had passed a consent order in this case, indicating that it had assessed the environmental impact of the Yarn Twisting unit and had granted permission for its operation. However, the applicant felt that his representation had not been adequately considered, and he sought a direction from the National Green Tribunal.

The disposal of the application with certain directions suggests that the National Green Tribunal may have found merit in the applicant's arguments. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of these directions and their implications for the operation of the Yarn Twisting unit.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the role of specialized courts in enforcing them. It also underscores the need for stakeholders to be involved in the decision-making process and for their representations to be adequately considered.
