In a recent court case, the question was raised as to whether a deceased individual had obtained any interest in a property under a settlement deed executed by his wife. The settlement deed stated that the property would be held in trust for the wife during her lifetime, and in the event of the husband surviving her, the property would belong to him absolutely. However, as the husband predeceased his wife, his interest in the property was only contingent and did not vest in him during his lifetime. Therefore, he did not have any interest in the property that could be said to have ceased on his death, and Section 7 of the E.D. Act did not apply.

The court was asked to determine whether the deceased had any interest in the property that could be subject to estate duty under Section 7 of the E.D. Act. The court found that the deceased did not have any interest in the property that could be subject to estate duty under Section 7 of the E.D. Act. The court also found that as the interest did not extend to any income from the property, it was not possible to evaluate the interest, and no duty could be levied under Section 7.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the husband's interest in the property was only contingent and did not vest in him during his lifetime. Therefore, he did not have any interest in the property that could be said to have ceased on his death, and Section 7 of the E.D. Act did not apply. Additionally, as the interest did not extend to any income from the property, it was not possible to evaluate the interest, and no duty could be levied under Section 7.

The court's decision was a negative one, meaning that the court answered the question in the negative and against the revenue. This means that the deceased did not have any interest in the property that could be subject to estate duty under Section 7 of the E.D. Act. The court's decision was based on the fact that the husband's interest in the property was only contingent and did not vest in him during his lifetime.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the fact that the deceased did not have any interest in the property that could be subject to estate duty under Section 7 of the E.D. Act. The court found that the husband's interest in the property was only contingent and did not vest in him during his lifetime. Therefore, he did not have any interest in the property that could be said to have ceased on his death, and Section 7 of the E.D. Act did not apply. Additionally, as the interest did not extend to any income from the property, it was not possible to evaluate the interest, and no duty could be levied under Section 7. The court's decision was a negative one, meaning that the court answered the question in the negative and against the revenue.
