The court order discusses the magnitude of the disaster and the adverse impact it had on the health and environment of the affected population. The court has passed various directions to ensure appropriate medical treatment and research for the gas victims.

The court order discusses the functions and terms of reference of the Monitoring Committee and Advisory Committee for the Bhopal Gas victims.

The court also proposed further powers for the Monitoring Committee to improve medical care for gas victims.

The Monitoring Committee for Medical Rehabilitation of Bhopal Gas Victims proposed to have more powers to improve the quality of medical care available to the victims. These powers include the ability to take up complaints, direct concerned departments, collect samples of medicine, recommend penal action, engage experts, and call for public hearings.
