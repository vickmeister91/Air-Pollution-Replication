The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court requesting a writ of mandamus to direct the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to decide on their application for exemption and registration under the Income Tax Act. The HSPCB had applied for exemption under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act, which provides for tax exemption for charitable trusts and institutions. The CBDT had rejected the application on the grounds that the HSPCB was not a charitable trust or institution.

The HSPCB argued that it was a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and was therefore entitled to exemption under Section 12A. The HSPCB also argued that it was engaged in activities that were beneficial to the environment and the public, and therefore qualified as a charitable institution.

The court heard arguments from both sides and observed that the CBDT had not considered the matter in its entirety before rejecting the application. The court noted that the HSPCB was a statutory body established under an Act of Parliament and was therefore entitled to exemption under Section 12A. The court also observed that the CBDT had not considered the activities of the HSPCB and had rejected the application solely on the grounds that it was not a charitable trust or institution.

The court ordered the CBDT to withdraw their previous order and pass a fresh order after considering the matter in its entirety. The court also directed the CBDT to decide on the applications for condonation of delay within three months. The court, however, did not consider the prayer for quashing of an order rejecting registration as it was pending adjudication before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that statutory bodies established under Acts of Parliament are entitled to exemption under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act. The decision also highlights the importance of considering the matter in its entirety before rejecting an application for exemption.

The HSPCB's application for exemption under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act is important as it would enable the organization to receive tax-exempt donations and grants, which would help it carry out its activities more effectively. The HSPCB is responsible for monitoring and controlling pollution in the state of Haryana and is engaged in activities such as monitoring of air and water quality, enforcement of pollution control laws, and public awareness campaigns.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision in the HSPCB's writ petition is a significant development in the field of taxation of statutory bodies. The decision reaffirms the principle that statutory bodies established under Acts of Parliament are entitled to exemption under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act. The decision also highlights the importance of considering the matter in its entirety before rejecting an application for exemption. The HSPCB's application for exemption under Section 12A is important as it would enable the organization to receive tax-exempt donations and grants, which would help it carry out its activities more effectively.
