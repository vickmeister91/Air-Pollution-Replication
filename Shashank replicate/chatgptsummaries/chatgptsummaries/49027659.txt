The court found that the offence under Section 188 IPC was not legally sustainable due to a violation of Section 195 Cr.P.C.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking to quash the criminal proceedings against him. The prosecution had alleged that the petitioner, who was a contesting candidate, had sent money through two others to be distributed to voters by illegal means.
