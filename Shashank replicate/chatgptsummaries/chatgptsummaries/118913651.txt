The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The first order pertains to an appeal filed by Smt. Surma against the termination of her services as an Aganwadi worker. The petitioner claimed that no inquiry was conducted before her termination and that her services were terminated based on a show cause notice. The court found that no inquiry was conducted and that the principles of natural justice were violated. The court cited previous cases and explained the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court quashed the termination order and ordered the reinstatement of the petitioner.

The second court order discusses the duty of departments or offices of the state to make decisions on various matters, which may involve both administrative and legal issues. The Board of Education is required to ascertain both the law and facts in such cases, and must act in good faith and listen to both sides. The court emphasizes the importance of natural justice, which includes the principles of 'nemo judex in causa sua' (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side). The court also notes that the concept of natural justice has evolved over time and that even administrative orders must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The court discusses the various definitions of natural justice and the importance of a fair hearing. The court also notes that there is a considerable divergence of opinion on whether relief can be refused even if natural justice is not followed, and that the courts can use their discretion in such cases.

The third court order discusses the importance of natural justice in fair adjudication and how it is deeply rooted in tradition and conscience. The court also notes that procedural safeguards have been read into Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court quashes the impugned order terminating the services of an Aaganwadi worker as no inquiry with the participation of the petitioner took place. The court directs the respondent to reinstate the petitioner forthwith in service and the petitioner shall also be entitled to 50% backwages/Honorarium. The writ appeal stands allowed.
