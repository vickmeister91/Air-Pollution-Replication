The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ petitions filed by mining companies in Karnataka seeking the release of minerals seized from their stack yards. The court has been investigating allegations of illegal mining in the Bellary region of Karnataka since 2006 and has imposed a complete ban on mining in the district of Bellary. The court has also categorized mines into three categories based on the extent of encroachment and violations of the Forest (Conservation) Act.

In one of the court orders, the court directed the respondents to release the minerals subject to the petitioner furnishing a bank guarantee for the value of the ore. The case had been pending for several years, and the court received an affidavit from a Range Forest Officer detailing the status of the case and the ongoing investigations by the Lokayuktha and the CBI. The court also noted that several other writ petitions related to the case had been withdrawn by the petitioners.

In another court order, the court allowed the petitioners to withdraw their writ petitions. The Hon'ble Supreme Court accepted the findings of a survey conducted by a Joint Team and determined the boundaries of each lease involved in the present proceeding. The court quashed FOC cases registered against a petitioner. The Hon'ble Supreme Court accepted the recommendation of the Central Empowered Committee regarding 'C' category mines and cancelled leases in respect of those mines. The petitioner had procured mineral from a 'C' category mine, and the State was permitted to invoke and encash bank guarantees furnished with regard to the Forest Offence Case.

The court has ordered the suspension of mining operations and transportation for 15 mining lease holders in Karnataka due to illegal mining activities. The court has closed the issue, and no further re-examination of the boundaries of the leases involved will be allowed.

In another court order, the court discusses illegal mining in forest lands and the confiscation of illegally mined iron ore. The court rejects the argument that dumping mining waste does not constitute mining operations and orders the closure of Category 'C' mines. The burden of proving the legality of the mined ore is placed on the petitioner, and the government is entitled to encash the bank guarantee. The court also cites relevant provisions and orders of the Apex Court to support its decision.

In the final court order, the court states that the government rightfully seized illegally extracted ore from forest land, and the petitioner's writ petition only seeks the release of the seized minerals subject to furnishing a bank guarantee. The petitioner cannot absolve himself of any liability in the case or proceedings pursuant to which the stock of iron ore was seized. The court dismisses the petition subject to the direction that the respondent shall invoke and encash the bank guarantee furnished under the interim order. The petitioner shall have the liberty to pursue such proceedings as he may be advised, in accordance with the law to reclaim the amount of the bank guarantee in question. The petitioner is directed to pay Rs. 1,00,000 as cost to respondent No.1 within one month.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to illegal mining activities in Karnataka and the release of minerals seized from mining companies' stack yards. The court has imposed a complete ban on mining in the district of Bellary and has categorized mines into three categories based on the extent of encroachment and violations of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court has also directed the release of minerals subject to the petitioner furnishing a bank guarantee for the value of the ore and has ordered the closure of Category 'C' mines. The burden of proving the legality of the mined ore is placed on the petitioner, and the government is entitled to encash the bank guarantee.
