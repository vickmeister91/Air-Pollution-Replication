A recent court order has shed light on the importance of following proper legal procedures when filing a complaint. The case in question pertains to a complaint made by a complainant against two accused individuals, one of whom allegedly paid a bribe to the other to secure his vote for the presidency of a village Panchayat Court. 

Initially, the complaint was returned by the Magistrate, who suggested that the offence fell under a different section of the law and required the sanction of the Local Government for prosecution. However, the court order states that the Magistrate had no right to disregard the complainant's choice of section under which to proceed and that a sanction would be required regardless of which section was used. 

This ruling highlights the importance of respecting the complainant's choice of section under which to proceed. It also emphasizes the need for proper legal procedures to be followed when filing a complaint. In this case, the Magistrate's decision to return the complaint was not in line with proper legal procedures, and the court order serves as a reminder that such decisions can have serious consequences.

The complainant was advised to obtain the necessary sanction and proceed with the case. This advice is important because it ensures that the case is being handled in accordance with the law. It also ensures that the complainant has the necessary support to pursue the case and seek justice.

The court order also sheds light on the issue of bribery in village Panchayat Courts. Bribery is a serious offence that undermines the integrity of the justice system. The fact that one of the accused individuals allegedly paid a bribe to secure his vote for the presidency of the court is a clear indication of the need for greater transparency and accountability in these courts.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures when filing a complaint. It also highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in village Panchayat Courts. By respecting the complainant's choice of section under which to proceed and ensuring that proper legal procedures are followed, we can ensure that justice is served and that the integrity of the justice system is maintained.
