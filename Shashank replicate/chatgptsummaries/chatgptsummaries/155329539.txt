The Karnataka High Court recently heard six criminal petitions filed by individuals accused of violating pollution control laws. The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings initiated against them in various courts in Haveri. The court consolidated the cases and heard them together to avoid repetition of discussion. However, the court did not provide a decision or ruling in the summarized text.

In another court order, the court addressed three cases pending before the Court of Civil Judge and J.M.F.C., Haveri. The petitioners were accused of causing air pollution while operating their industrial plant and violating provisions of the Air Act. The petitioners challenged the legality and correctness of the order of the JMFC Court, which registered the case and initiated criminal proceedings against them. The court found that the initiation of criminal proceedings against the petitioners was an abuse of process of the Court and set aside the impugned orders. However, the Pollution Control Board is at liberty to take appropriate action if the petitioners violated any provisions of the Air Act.

The court order states that the petitions have been disposed of and action should be taken in accordance with the law. The judge has made some observations in this regard.
