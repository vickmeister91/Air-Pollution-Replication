The Allahabad High Court recently quashed three demand notices/orders issued by the U.P. Pollution Control Board, which had levied environmental compensation on M/S Ideal S.S. Hides Thru. Prop. Mohd. Muneef Meraj for alleged violation of provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court found that the impugned orders were issued in violation of the principles of natural justice, as no notice or opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner. The court directed the U.P. Pollution Control Board to take appropriate decisions afresh only after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner in the matter relating to levying of environmental compensation.

The case was brought before the court by M/S Ideal S.S. Hides Thru. Prop. Mohd. Muneef Meraj, who had been issued three demand notices/orders by the U.P. Pollution Control Board for alleged violation of provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The notices/orders had levied environmental compensation on the petitioner, and the petitioner had challenged the same before the Allahabad High Court.

The court found that the impugned orders were issued in violation of the principles of natural justice, as no notice or opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner. The court observed that the U.P. Pollution Control Board had not followed the procedure laid down under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before issuing the demand notices/orders. The court held that this was a clear violation of the principles of natural justice, and that the impugned orders were therefore liable to be quashed.

The court also observed that the U.P. Pollution Control Board had not provided any evidence to support its claim that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the U.P. Pollution Control Board had not discharged its burden of proof, and that the impugned orders were therefore liable to be quashed on this ground as well.

The court directed the U.P. Pollution Control Board to take appropriate decisions afresh only after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner in the matter relating to levying of environmental compensation. The court also directed the U.P. Pollution Control Board to follow the procedure laid down under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and to provide evidence to support its claim that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Act.

This judgment of the Allahabad High Court is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the principles of natural justice in administrative proceedings. The court has held that administrative authorities must follow the procedure laid down under the law, and must give an opportunity of hearing to the affected parties before taking any adverse action against them. The court has also emphasized the importance of evidence in administrative proceedings, and has held that administrative authorities must provide evidence to support their claims before taking any adverse action against the affected parties.
