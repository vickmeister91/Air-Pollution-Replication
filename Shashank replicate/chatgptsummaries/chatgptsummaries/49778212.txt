The court order pertains to various petitions related to the management of municipal solid waste in Amritsar. The first petition, filed by the Pollution Control Committee, sought the shifting of the dumping place of municipal solid waste and dead animals to an authorized and approved place for scientific disposal. The second petition was filed by M/s AKC Developers Ltd., the successful bidder for processing and disposal of municipal solid waste, challenging the cancellation of their contract by the Municipal Corporation.

The court disposed of both petitions and adjourned the first petition for six months. The court has adjourned a petition for six months to allow the Corporation to submit a status report on the progress made towards setting up a Solid Waste Treatment Plant. The plant must comply with the Water & Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts and obtain all necessary permissions before starting work. The petition relates to the dumping of solid waste in Amritsar, which has caused pollution.

The Corporation has submitted a status report stating that it is using a landfill site at Bhagtanwala and has applied for authorization under the Rules. The Pollution Control Board has requested a time-bound action plan from the Corporation for managing the Municipal solid waste in accordance with the Rules. The court ordered the Municipal Corporation to submit an action plan for managing solid waste in accordance with the Supreme Court's order. The Corporation had not obtained authorization for waste management, and the waste collection agency had closed down without notice. The piles of garbage on the streets were causing health concerns.

The petitioner had failed to obtain necessary clearance certificates from statutory agencies, and their contract was cancelled. The court ordered immediate steps to be taken for cleaning the city and proper disposal of garbage to prevent the spread of diseases. The court order discusses a case where a lease deed was cancelled due to the petitioner's failure to obtain necessary clearance from the Pollution Control Board. The State filed an affidavit pointing out illegalities and irregularities committed by the consultant of the project and functionaries of the Municipal Corporation.

The court also questions the need for permission from the Pollution Control Board for use as a landfill or dumping site. The consultant of the Municipal Corporation filed an affidavit justifying the grant of the contract to the petitioner, but it is unclear how the affidavit was placed on record since the consultant is not a party to the writ petition. The court order outlines rules for the management of municipal solid waste, including the requirement for municipal authorities or facility operators to apply for authorization to set up waste processing and disposal facilities.

The order also specifies compliance criteria and procedures for managing waste, and outlines specifications and standards for landfill sites, including site selection and planning requirements. Municipal authorities are required to comply with these rules and furnish annual reports to the relevant authorities. The court order states that existing landfill sites that have been in use for more than five years must be improved according to the given specifications.

The petitioner's argument that their contract was terminated without a hearing and violated natural justice is dismissed. The court also notes that the petitioner failed to seek authorization from the Pollution Control Board for their waste management site, which disentitles them from disputing the contract cancellation. The court also mentions several judgments related to fair and reasonable actions by the state and its functionaries.

The court order cites several judgments related to the enforcement of non-statutory contracts and the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner argues that the breach of contract can be remedied through a writ, while the respondent argues that only damages can be claimed through arbitration. The court cites Radha Krishna Agarwal's case to divide contracts into three categories, with the present case falling under the third category of non-statutory contracts.

The court concludes that no writ can be issued under Article 226 to compel authorities to remedy a breach of contract pure and simple. The court order pertains to a real estate developer's project for an administrative building and commercial complex on a plot of land belonging to the municipality. The court states that while principles of judicial review apply to government bodies exercising their contractual powers, there must be a public law element to the contractual decision before judicial review is invoked.

The court also cites previous cases to establish that disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of a non-statutory contract cannot be agitated in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court order discusses various cases related to the jurisdiction and scope of the powers of the Writ Court in exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

It emphasizes that the State or an instrumentality of State has an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court also mentions that the impact of every State action is on public interest and that an additional contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee under Article 14 of non-arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its actions.

The court order states that actions of the State or its instrumentality must be informed by reason and may be questioned as arbitrary in certain cases. The court will examine actions of the State if they pertain to the public law domain and refrain from examining them if they pertain to the private law field. The power of judicial review in a concluded contract is limited and is not all pervasive as in the matter of awarding a contract.

The contract for the erection of a Municipal Solid Waste Management Plant would not involve a public law element. The
