The court order in question relates to a case filed by M/s Krishna Udyog against the State of Haryana and others. The petitioner, a manufacturer of plywood, had applied for consent to establish and operate under the Water Act and the Air Act. However, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board had issued a notice to shut down the unit for non-compliance with the conditions of consent.

The matter was brought before the court, which was informed that the consent to operate had been granted to the petitioner until 31.03.2021. As a result, the petitioner did not press the petition any further. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition as having been rendered infructuous.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the conditions of consent when operating a business that has the potential to impact the environment. The Water Act and the Air Act are designed to regulate and control pollution, and it is the responsibility of businesses to ensure that they are operating in compliance with these laws.

In this case, it appears that the petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions of consent, leading to the notice to shut down the unit. However, it is not clear from the court order what specific violations had occurred.

It is worth noting that the court order does not provide any further details on the matter, such as whether the petitioner has taken steps to rectify the non-compliance or whether the unit has been shut down. It is also unclear whether the petitioner will be able to continue operating after the consent to operate expires on 31.03.2021.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the consequences of failing to do so. It is essential for businesses to take their environmental responsibilities seriously and to ensure that they are operating in compliance with the law to avoid legal action and potential harm to the environment.
