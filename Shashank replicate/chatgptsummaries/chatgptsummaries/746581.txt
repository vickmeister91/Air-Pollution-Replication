The court recently issued two orders related to environmental concerns in India. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Jayachandran, the President of Tamil Nadu Green Movement, challenging the approval given by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests, for the diversion of 2.98 hectares of forest land in Vallakaradu Reserve Forest of Theni Forest Division/Theni District for the construction of a new bus stand at Theni by the Commissioner, Theni, Allinagaram Municipality, Theni District. The petitioner argued that the approval was given without prior approval of the Central Government and that the proposed bus stand would pollute the reserve forest and harm the environment.

The court found that the Central Government had indeed given approval and that all legal formalities had been complied with by the State Government. Therefore, the writ petition was dismissed. The court order highlights the importance of following legal procedures and obtaining necessary approvals before undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment.

The second court order relates to the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the protection of the environment. The NPV has been calculated based on economic principles as directed by the Supreme Court. The court order states that the payment of NPV is for the protection of the environment and not for any proprietary rights. The court also mentions the need for afforestation on a different suitable place whenever deforestation takes place.

The order dismisses the writ petition challenging the proceedings of the Deputy Conservator of Forests relating to the first stage approval issued under Section 2 of the Act. The court finds no merit in the petition and dismisses it. The project to establish a new bus stand is for the benefit of the public and will advance public interest.

Both court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and following legal procedures while undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment. The court has emphasized the need to obtain necessary approvals from the Central Government and comply with legal formalities before undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment.

The court has also stressed the importance of paying NPV for the protection of the environment. The payment of NPV is not for any proprietary rights but for the protection of the environment. The court has also emphasized the need for afforestation on a different suitable place whenever deforestation takes place.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and following legal procedures while undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment. The court has emphasized the need to obtain necessary approvals from the Central Government and comply with legal formalities before undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment. The court has also stressed the importance of paying NPV for the protection of the environment and the need for afforestation on a different suitable place whenever deforestation takes place.
