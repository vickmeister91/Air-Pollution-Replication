The court order pertains to three separate cases, all of which deal with maintenance payments under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In the first case, Ravinder Yadav had filed a criminal revision challenging a judgment passed by the Family Court, Gurgaon, which had directed him to pay maintenance to his wife and minor son. The court heard arguments from both sides and upheld the judgment of the lower court, stating that the petitioner had tried to conceal his true income and assets and that the amount of maintenance assessed was not excessive. The court also noted that allegations of cruelty and infidelity were not relevant to the proceedings under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

In the second case, the petitioner, who is the husband, had claimed that he only had his pension as a source of income and had no other assets. However, evidence produced in court showed that he had substantial assets, including immovable property, and was actively trying to conceal his true income and assets. The court found that the petitioner was not a person of meager means and was liable to pay maintenance to his wife and minor child. The court also dismissed two applications filed by the petitioner's brother and mother, which alleged collusion between the parties and sought to implead themselves in the case.

In the third case, the court dismissed a criminal revision and ordered the petitioner to pay arrears of maintenance within three months. The applicants were not necessary parties in the proceedings and the court has imposed costs of Rs. 30,000. The record of the trial court will be sent back. The order was made on August 10, 2018.

In all three cases, the court has upheld the provisions of Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with maintenance of a wife, minor child or old-age parents. The court has also noted that attempts to conceal income and assets will not be tolerated and that maintenance payments must be made in a timely and regular manner. The court has also dismissed attempts to involve unnecessary parties in the proceedings and has imposed costs on those who have made such attempts.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of complying with the provisions of Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code and of the consequences of attempting to conceal income and assets. They also highlight the need for parties to the proceedings to focus on the relevant issues and to avoid unnecessary delays and complications.
