In October 2016, the Kerala High Court delivered a decision on a writ petition filed by E. Rasheedu against the State of Kerala and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner, a retired senior superintendent of the Board, had filed a public interest litigation challenging the legality of an order allowing an employee to go on deputation for higher studies and receive pay and allowances during that time. The petitioner argued that there was no provision for such deputation in the Kerala State Pollution Control Board Subordinate Service Regulations.

The court heard the case on October 14, 2016, and delivered its decision on the same day. The summary does not provide information on the details of the case or the court's decision. However, it is known that the court found that the Board had been deputing engineers for higher studies since 1977 and had decided to allow deputation for Ph.D. programs on a case-by-case basis. The court declared the first two prayers of the writ petition as infructuous, but the third prayer, seeking recovery of the salary paid to the employee during deputation, was pressed by the petitioner.

The court order states that deputation for Ph.D programs should be granted on a case-by-case basis, based on the benefit it will bring to the Board and the state. The Board allowed the 3rd respondent to undergo deputation for a Ph.D in water pollution monitoring and prediction, with the understanding that it would not result in out-of-turn promotion or additional monetary benefits. The state government believes that higher studies will benefit the discharge of statutory functions.

The court found no public interest in the litigation and dismissed the writ petition. The court's decision implies that the Board has the authority to allow deputation for higher studies on a case-by-case basis, as long as it benefits the Board and the state. The court also clarified that deputation for higher studies should not result in out-of-turn promotion or additional monetary benefits.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of considering the benefits and drawbacks of deputation for higher studies on a case-by-case basis. It also emphasizes the need for clear regulations and guidelines regarding deputation for higher studies to avoid confusion and legal challenges.
