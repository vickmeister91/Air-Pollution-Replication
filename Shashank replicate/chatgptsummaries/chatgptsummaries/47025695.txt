The state of Uttarakhand has been facing a major issue of improper waste management, leading to the dumping of municipal waste in rivers and forest lands, posing a threat to the health of people living nearby. To address this issue, several court orders have been issued, directing the state government and municipal authorities to take necessary measures for proper waste management.

One of the court orders was issued in response to a writ petition filed by the Shri Sai Nath Seva Mandal against the state of Uttarakhand and others for dumping municipal waste in Dhela river. The court directed the respondents to take remedial measures and stop dumping waste in the river. The court also ordered the respondents to restore the work and not make any payment to the contractor. The court further directed the state to file a report on the progress of setting up solid waste management in compliance with the rules.

Another court order discussed the implementation of the Solid Waste Management Scheme in various districts of Uttarakhand. The delay in implementation was due to a delay in environmental clearance by the Government of India. The court directed all District Magistrates to provide information on the progress made in implementing Waste Disposal Management Rules. The affidavits filed by the District Magistrates provide details on the steps taken by municipalities, Nagar Panchayats, and corporations for scientific disposal of municipal waste. The affidavits also highlight the lack of land for disposal of organic garbage in some areas and the proposals sent to the government for the same.

The court order also discusses the management of solid waste in various districts of Uttarakhand. The affidavit of District Magistrates from each district outlines the availability of land for garbage disposal and the progress made towards implementing Waste Management Rules. The government has also obtained permission for scientific disposal of municipal waste and sanctioned funds for different clusters. A committee has been formed to make land available for trenching ground in local bodies.

The court order outlines guidelines for waste management, including the integration of waste pickers and collectors into the system. It directs local authorities to implement these rules, ensure suitable land is allocated for waste processing and disposal facilities, and establish separate spaces for waste segregation and storage. The order also assigns duties to district magistrates, rural development departments, and the Central Pollution Control Board. Local authorities are responsible for preparing a solid waste management plan, collecting waste from households and commercial premises, and promoting home composting and community-level waste processing.

The court order also outlines the duties and responsibilities of waste generators, operators of waste processing facilities, and state pollution control boards or committees in managing solid waste. Waste generators are required to segregate and store waste in separate streams, wrap used sanitary waste securely, and dispose of construction and demolition waste and horticulture waste as per regulations. Operators of waste processing facilities must obtain necessary approvals and ensure safe and environmentally sound operations. State pollution control boards or committees are responsible for enforcing regulations, monitoring compliance, and regulating inter-state movement of waste.

The court order discusses the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016, which require waste generators to store horticulture and garden waste separately and dispose of it according to local body directions. The order also outlines various rules for waste management in different settings, such as events, street vendors, hotels and restaurants, and healthcare facilities. The order notes that despite the notification of these rules, little has been done to implement them. The Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 are also discussed, which outline the duties of occupiers to handle biomedical waste safely and in accordance with the rules.

The court order requires establishments to review and monitor their biomedical waste management activities and maintain records for five years. Existing incinerators must meet specified standards within two years. Municipal bodies are required to dispose of waste in a scientific manner to avoid contamination and pollution. The court emphasizes the importance of clean and hygienic environments for citizens and imposes mandatory directions for proper waste management, including daily cleaning of streets and public places and fines for violations.

The court order authorizes magistrates to impose fines for violating waste management rules and mandates that workers be provided with necessary equipment. It also directs the state government to make decisions on waste management proposals and for local bodies to prepare waste management plans. The order also includes directives for setting up waste processing and disposal facilities, safe storage and transportation of hazardous waste, and public awareness campaigns.

In conclusion, the court orders aim to ensure proper waste management in the state of Uttarakhand by directing the state government and municipal authorities to take necessary measures for scientific disposal of municipal waste, segregation of waste, and safe handling of biomedical waste. The orders also emphasize the importance of public awareness campaigns and the integration of waste pickers and collectors into the system. The court has authorized magistrates to impose fines for violating waste management rules and has mandated that workers be provided with necessary equipment. The orders are to be implemented in letter and spirit, and copies are to be sent to various government officials for compliance.
