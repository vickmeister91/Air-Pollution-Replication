The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shyam Sunder Sharma, who challenged the rejection of his application under Section 33(c)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 by the labour court in Bikaner. Sharma claimed that he was not allowed to discharge his duties and was entitled to wages, while the employer argued that no work was done by Sharma.

Section 33(c)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 deals with the power of the labour court to determine the entitlement of a workman to any benefit or payment. In this case, Sharma was seeking to establish his entitlement to wages for the period during which he claimed he was not allowed to discharge his duties.

The court held that only the entitlement of a workman can be determined under Section 33(c)(2) and since Sharma's entitlement was disputed, the order of the labour court was upheld and the writ petition was dismissed. However, the court also noted that Sharma was allowed to seek appropriate remedy to settle his entitlement.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it clarifies the scope of Section 33(c)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The court held that the provision only allows for the determination of the entitlement of a workman to any benefit or payment, and does not extend to the determination of the actual amount of such benefit or payment.

Furthermore, the court's decision highlights the importance of establishing entitlement before seeking a remedy under Section 33(c)(2). In this case, since Sharma's entitlement was disputed, the court was unable to grant him the relief he sought.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the interpretation and application of Section 33(c)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It underscores the need for workmen to establish their entitlement before seeking a remedy under the provision, and clarifies the scope of the provision in relation to the determination of entitlement.
