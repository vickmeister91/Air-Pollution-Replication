This court order pertains to a promissory note case where the defendant had appealed a decision that the District Munsif had no jurisdiction over the case. The Subordinate Judge reversed the decision and remanded the case for trial. However, during the trial, the defendant was absent and the plaintiff was awarded an ex parte decree. The defendant's application to set aside the decree was dismissed and the decision was upheld on appeal. The defendant then filed a Civil Revision Petition, which was dismissed as there was no evidence of a failure of justice and the defendant had no sufficient reason for his absence during the trial.

The case began with the defendant appealing a decision that the District Munsif had no jurisdiction over the promissory note case. The Subordinate Judge reversed this decision and remanded the case for trial. However, during the trial, the defendant was absent and the plaintiff was awarded an ex parte decree. An ex parte decree is a legal order that is granted in favor of one party in the absence of the other party. In this case, the plaintiff was awarded the decree because the defendant was not present to defend himself.

The defendant then filed an application to set aside the ex parte decree, but it was dismissed. The decision was upheld on appeal, and the defendant was left with no other option but to file a Civil Revision Petition. A Civil Revision Petition is a legal remedy that allows a party to challenge a decision made by a lower court. However, in this case, the petition was dismissed as there was no evidence of a failure of justice and the defendant had no sufficient reason for his absence during the trial.

The court's decision to dismiss the Civil Revision Petition was based on the fact that the defendant had no valid reason for his absence during the trial. The defendant had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he was unable to attend the trial. As a result, the court found that there was no failure of justice and that the ex parte decree was valid.

In conclusion, this court order highlights the importance of attending court proceedings and defending oneself in legal cases. The defendant in this case lost the opportunity to defend himself and was ultimately left with no legal remedy to challenge the ex parte decree. It is important for parties to attend court proceedings and provide valid reasons for their absence if they are unable to attend. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences and the loss of legal rights.
