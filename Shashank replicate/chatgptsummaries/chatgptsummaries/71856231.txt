The petitioner in this case filed a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, claiming that he had been falsely implicated in a criminal case and had pleaded alibi. The police investigated the matter and found the plea to be true, but the report was not seen in the original case diary. As a result, the Superintendent of Police was requested to pursue the matter and place the report before the court on the next date of hearing.

The case was listed for hearing on 04.01.2019, and it was expected that the report would be presented before the court at that time. The petitioner's claim of alibi was crucial to his defense, and the report confirming his alibi would have been a significant piece of evidence in his favor.

It is not clear from the available information whether the report was ultimately presented before the court on the scheduled date of hearing. However, the fact that the police had investigated the matter and found the petitioner's plea of alibi to be true suggests that there may have been some merit to his claim of being falsely implicated in the case.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of thorough investigation and documentation in criminal cases. Had the report confirming the petitioner's alibi been properly recorded in the case diary, it may have had a significant impact on the outcome of the case. As it stands, however, it is unclear what ultimately happened in this case and whether justice was served.
