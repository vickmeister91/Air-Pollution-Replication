On May 27, 2015, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh passed an order in a case filed by Raj Reddy Kallem. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C to set aside an order passed by a learned J.M.I.C. However, the court order stated that the petition had become infructuous as the petitioner had since been convicted. As a result, the present petition was disposed of as not pressed.

The case highlights the importance of understanding legal terminology and procedures. Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by a learned J.M.I.C, which refers to a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class. However, the petition became infructuous as the petitioner had already been convicted, meaning that the order sought to be set aside was no longer relevant.

The court's decision to dispose of the petition as not pressed indicates that the petitioner did not contest the court's finding that the petition had become infructuous. This may have been due to a lack of legal grounds to challenge the court's decision or a recognition that the petition was no longer relevant. It is also possible that the petitioner may have accepted the conviction and decided not to pursue the matter further.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding legal terminology and procedures when filing petitions or seeking legal remedies. It also highlights the need to carefully consider the relevance and validity of any legal action taken, particularly in cases where circumstances may have changed since the action was initiated.
