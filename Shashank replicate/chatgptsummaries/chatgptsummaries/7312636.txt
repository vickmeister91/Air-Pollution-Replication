The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) issued a notification withdrawing its earlier notifications and announcing that it would only accept analysis reports from laboratories recognized by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and Climate Change, Government of India New Delhi. This notification was challenged by three petitioner firms who were recognized by the RSPCB. They sought relief to restrain the Board from interfering with their work. The matter was brought before the court, which held that the petitioner firms had no indefeasible or vested right by their recognition by the Board and that the power conferred on the Board under Section 17(2) of both the Water Act and Air Act was one of legislative discretion.

The RSPCB argued that the matter was amenable to the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and that the petitioner firms had an alternative remedy under Section 14 of the Act. The court dismissed the writ petitions and held that the petitioner firms had an alternative remedy under the NGT Act, 2010, and should avail it.
