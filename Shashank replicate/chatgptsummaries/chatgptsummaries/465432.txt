The court order pertains to a defamation case where the plaintiff sued the defendants for publishing a defamatory news item about him. The news item alleged that the plaintiff had stolen elephant tusks. The defendants claimed that the news item was true and justified. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the appellate court ruled in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed to the higher court, but the court upheld the appellate court's decision. The court also discussed the legal principles related to the shooting of a wild elephant and the ownership of its tusks under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court order states that possession of a captive animal or animal article is presumed to be unlawful. In the case discussed, the tusks of a wild elephant were found to belong to the state government, not the plaintiff who had shot the elephant. The plaintiff's defense plea of justification by truth was not upheld, and it was found that he had removed the tusks with a dishonest intention. The court also discusses the importance of protecting forest and wildlife, and the unsatisfactory implementation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The second appeal was dismissed, but no order was made as to costs.

The case in question revolves around a news item that was published about the plaintiff, alleging that he had stolen elephant tusks. The plaintiff sued the defendants for defamation, claiming that the news item was false and defamatory. The defendants, on the other hand, claimed that the news item was true and justified. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the appellate court ruled in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff then appealed to the higher court, but the court upheld the appellate court's decision.

The court also discussed the legal principles related to the shooting of a wild elephant and the ownership of its tusks under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court noted that the Act provides for the protection of wild animals and their habitats, and prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal. The Act also provides for the protection of animal articles, such as tusks, horns, and skins, and prohibits their possession, sale, or transport without a license.

In the case discussed, the plaintiff had shot a wild elephant and removed its tusks. The plaintiff claimed that he had shot the elephant in self-defense, as the elephant had charged at him. However, the court found that the plaintiff had removed the tusks with a dishonest intention, as he had not reported the incident to the forest department and had not obtained a license for the possession of the tusks. The court also noted that possession of a captive animal or animal article is presumed to be unlawful, unless the possessor can prove that he obtained it lawfully.

The court further held that the tusks of a wild elephant belong to the state government, and not to the person who shot the elephant. The court noted that the Act provides for the vesting of ownership of wild animals and their articles in the state government, and that the state government has the power to regulate their possession, sale, or transport.

The court also discussed the importance of protecting forest and wildlife, and the unsatisfactory implementation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court noted that the Act has been enacted to protect the rich biodiversity of the country, and to ensure that the future generations can enjoy the benefits of the natural resources. However, the court observed that the Act has not been implemented effectively, and that there is a need for greater awareness and enforcement of the Act.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a defamation case where the plaintiff sued the defendants for publishing a defamatory news item about him. The court ruled in favor of the defendants, and also discussed the legal principles related to the shooting of a wild elephant and the ownership of its tusks under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court held that possession of a captive animal or animal article is presumed to be unlawful, and that the tusks of a wild elephant belong to the state government. The court also emphasized the importance of protecting forest and wildlife, and the need for greater awareness and enforcement of the Wild Life (Protection) Act.
