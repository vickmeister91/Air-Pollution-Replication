The court order pertains to a case where a petitioner had applied for renewal of a lease for mining iron ore on forest land. The Central Government declined the request, citing concerns of soil erosion, lack of efforts to rehabilitate the area, and failure to establish the inevitability of diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The petitioner argued that they had a vested right to seek renewal, but the court held that the right to seek renewal was subject to the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, which forbids conversion of forest land to non-forest use without prior approval of the Central Government.

The court order upholds the Conservation of Forests Act and denies a lease to the petitioner for non-forest use of a forest area. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving green spaces for future generations and criticizes the Central Government for not being adequately represented in the proceedings. The writ petition is dismissed without costs.
