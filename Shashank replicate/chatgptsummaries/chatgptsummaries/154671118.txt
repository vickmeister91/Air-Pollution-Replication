The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by C.K. Sood and two other senior officers of BSES Rajdhani Power Limited against an impugned order dated 29.04.2013. The case involves an FIR lodged in PS Palam Village in respect of the death of a child who got electrocuted near a pole. The petitioners were accused of failing to produce certain documents in response to a notice under section 91 Cr.PC. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately found that the accused had responded to the notice and had not willfully disobeyed it. The court dismissed the petition and did not find an offense under section 175 IPC.

The court order states that anyone who intentionally fails to produce or deliver a document or electronic record to a public servant can be punished with imprisonment or a fine. However, in this case, the accused did not willfully omit to produce the relevant documents as they were seeking time to retrieve them from an old record. Therefore, the court quashed the criminal proceedings against the accused and ordered the kalandara and all related proceedings to be quashed. The order was announced on December 12, 2013.
