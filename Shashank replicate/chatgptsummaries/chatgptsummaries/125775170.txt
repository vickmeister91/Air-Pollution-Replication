The court order pertains to the issue of unauthorized constructions and misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes in Delhi. The court notes that despite its efforts to bring sanity to urban living, little has been done to address the issue. The court emphasizes the importance of implementing the rule of law to protect the fundamental rights of citizens and preserve the environment.

The court appointed a Monitoring Committee to oversee compliance with its directions regarding industrial activity in residential areas. The court also addressed the issue of misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes and stated that a beginning must be made to set things right, beginning with major violators. The court directed the Delhi Municipal Corporation to give public notices to stop the misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes and appointed a Monitoring Committee to oversee the implementation of the law.

However, the government introduced a bill that provided a moratorium on all adverse action in respect of unauthorized development, which was intended to be a temporary measure for one year but has since been re-enacted until 31st December, 2017. The court order questions the government's motives for introducing the bill and highlights the need for accountability of those violating the law and those responsible for enforcing it.

The court order pertains to the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006, which provided protection to those who carried out unauthorized development in Delhi. The court stayed certain directions contained in a notification issued by the government of India on May 20, 2006, which virtually restored the status quo ante. The court also extended the time to stop misuse and comply with the undertaking given in respect of 40,814 commercial establishments until September 15, 2006. The court restrained the respondents from issuing any other notification for conversion of residential premises to commercial use, except with the leave of the court. The court also considered two applications filed by the applicants who had leased out their property in a residential area for commercial use.

The court order pertains to a property leased out for commercial purposes in a residential area, which was sealed by the Monitoring Committee for violating court orders. The lessee filed an appeal to de-seal the property, which was granted subject to payment of conversion charges and an undertaking to stop misuse. The property was later re-sealed for misuse and the applicants have now filed for permission to appeal to the appropriate statutory Appellate Tribunal against the sealing order. The court has directed the applicants to file an affidavit before the Monitoring Committee stating that they will use the premises only for residential purposes and for no other purpose whatsoever, and to identify the persons for whose residential use the premises are sought to be de-sealed.

The court has ordered the withdrawal of writ petitions transferred to the Delhi High Court and requested the Monitoring Committee to set up a website to make their reports available to the citizens of Delhi. The court has also requested the assistance of Mr. Ranjit Kumar in the matter. The order was issued on December 15, 2017.

In summary, the court order addresses the issue of unauthorized constructions and misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes in Delhi. The court emphasizes the importance of implementing the rule of law to protect the fundamental rights of citizens and preserve the environment.
