The court order pertains to two cases where residents of various municipal committees in Punjab challenged the imposition of charges for laying down sewerage. In the first case, the court examined the provisions of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, and concluded that the municipal committees had the authority to levy sewerage charges as a fee, subject to the previous sanction of the State Government. The court found that there was a quid pro quo and nexus between the service rendered and the charges levied. Therefore, the writ petitions were dismissed.

In the second case, the court discussed a writ petition challenging the charges levied for sewerage facilities in Patiala. The petition lacked details on whether there was a quid pro quo and nexus between the service rendered and the charges levied. The respondents provided details on the loan taken from the World Bank and Life Insurance Corporation of India to provide sanitation facilities. The court found that the sewerage charges collected were nominal and would not cover all expenses incurred by the Municipal Committee. The court dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of the learned Single Judge.
