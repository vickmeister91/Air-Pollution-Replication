The Madras High Court recently heard a case involving M/s.Romana Distillery Industries Pvt. Ltd, who had dug a well in Tirunelveli District to draw water for manufacturing packaged drinking water. The company had obtained all necessary orders and permissions from various authorities, but the District Collector issued a show cause notice under Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, calling for the company to be restrained from drawing water from the well. The District Collector subsequently passed an order prohibiting the drawal of ground water by the company and ordered the closure of the unit.

The company challenged the order in the Madras High Court, arguing that the District Collector had no jurisdiction to invoke his power under Section 133 of the Code, as the drawal of water was going to be performed in accordance with the orders issued by various authorities under at least four enactments governing the field. Additionally, the company argued that no preliminary order under Section 133(1) of the Code was passed, and therefore, the impugned order, which is a final order under Section 133 of the Code, is wholly without jurisdiction and the same is vitiated.

The court found in favor of the company, stating that the District Collector had no jurisdiction to pass the order. The court rejected the argument that the District Collector was empowered to pass a final order without passing a preliminary order under Section 133(1) of the Code. The court held that the impugned order, which was passed without a preliminary order, is not sustainable and is liable to be set aside.

The court further held that the orders passed by various authorities, which allowed the company to draw water from the well, were valid and in accordance with the law. The court noted that the company had obtained all necessary orders and permissions from various authorities, and therefore, the District Collector had no jurisdiction to pass an order prohibiting the drawal of ground water by the company and ordering the closure of the unit.

The court allowed the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the company and set aside the impugned order. The District Collector or any other aggrieved persons were given the liberty to work out their remedy against the orders passed by various authorities.

This case highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining all necessary orders and permissions from various authorities before undertaking any activity. It also emphasizes the need for authorities to act within their jurisdiction and not exceed their powers. The court's decision ensures that the company can continue to operate and provide packaged drinking water to consumers, while also upholding the rule of law.
