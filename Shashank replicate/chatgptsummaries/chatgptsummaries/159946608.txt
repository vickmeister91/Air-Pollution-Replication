The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by M/s Roshni Hardware & Mill Store against ICICI Bank Ltd. The petitioner had approached the bank for an overdraft facility, which was sanctioned but not repaid. The bank filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and during the trial, the petitioner moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for the production of the overdraft agreement and RBI guidelines. The application was rejected, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately agreed with the petitioner that relevant documents can be summoned in evidence from the possession of the respondent.

The court order states that the petitioner's application to summon an overdraft agreement and RBI guidelines was dismissed by the trial court, and the petitioner's plea regarding miscalculation of interest is irrelevant to the case. The court found that the overdraft agreement is not a relevant document for establishing the petitioner's defense, and the plea taken by the petitioner cannot be accepted. The court also found no irregularity in the trial court's decision and dismissed the revision petition.
