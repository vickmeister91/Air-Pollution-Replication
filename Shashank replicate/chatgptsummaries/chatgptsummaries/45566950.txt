In the first court order, the petitioner filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to close and seal an illegal road construction materials processing unit run by respondents 7 to 10. The petitioner claimed that the unit caused heavy air pollution and nuisance, affecting the health of residents in the locality. The respondents were accused of illegal quarrying and purchasing of unauthorised materials, which they processed and sold to other roadwork contractors. The Pollution Control Board had not issued any certificate for the operations of the respondents, and the 6th respondent had not issued any certificate to that effect.

The court noted that the respondents had not obtained any necessary certificates or permissions to operate the unit. The court also observed that the unit was causing heavy air pollution and nuisance, which was affecting the health of the residents in the locality. The court held that the respondents were operating the unit illegally and directed them to close and seal the unit in accordance with the law.

In the second court order, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation against respondents 7 to 10, who are involved in the mining and transportation of minerals. The court notes that a relative of the petitioner had already filed writ petitions in the matter, which were transferred to the National Green Tribunal. The court cites a judgment by the Supreme Court stating that environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal and not before the High Court. Therefore, the court dismisses the writ petition and directs the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal.

The court observed that the issues raised in the writ petition were environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act. The court noted that a relative of the petitioner had already filed writ petitions in the matter, which were transferred to the National Green Tribunal. The court held that the petitioner should approach the National Green Tribunal to litigate the matter.

In conclusion, the court orders deal with two different cases. In the first case, the court directed the respondents to close and seal an illegal road construction materials processing unit that was causing heavy air pollution and nuisance. In the second case, the court dismissed the writ petition and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal to litigate the matter. Both court orders highlight the importance of obtaining necessary certificates and permissions to operate units and the need to approach the appropriate forum to litigate environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act.
