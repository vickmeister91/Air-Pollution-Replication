The case in question involves a petitioner who challenged an order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Phalodi, which rejected the application of the petitioner for dropping the proceedings and ordered to close down the lime-kiln of the petitioner in village Sanwara. The respondent No. 2 Gordhan alleged in his complaint that the lime-kiln run by the petitioner is creating air pollution by throwing smoke and dust thereby causing nuisance making vicinity inhabitable because the lime-kiln has been installed in the mid of the residential houses of the village.

The court found that the initial order passed by the learned Executive Magistrate on 3.6.96, discloses that it is not a conditional order as per the requirements of Section 133 Cr.P.C. When no conditional order was passed it was not justified to pass at any later stage an order closing the lime-kiln more so when there was no stage of passing any injunction order under Section 142 Cr.P.C.

The court partly set aside the impugned order dated 7.2.98 to the extent it orders the closing of the lime kiln. The learned Sub Divisional Magistrate, Phalodi is directed to hear both the parties again after giving them reasonable opportunity to place material on record and to pass order under Section 142 Cr.P.C. in accordance with law within one month from the date of receiving copy of this order.

In summary, the petitioner had applied for the proceedings to be dropped and for the lime-kiln to remain open, but the Sub Divisional Magistrate rejected the application and ordered the lime-kiln to be closed due to allegations of air pollution and nuisance. However, the court found that the initial order was not conditional and therefore it was not justified to pass an order closing the lime-kiln at a later stage. The court partly set aside the order and directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to hear both parties again and pass an order in accordance with the law within one month.
