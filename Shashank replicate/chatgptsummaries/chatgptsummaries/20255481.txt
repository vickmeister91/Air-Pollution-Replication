The case against Jitul Rabha pertains to a wildlife protection case, which is a serious offence in India. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and the prevention of their hunting, poaching, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Jitul Rabha had been in custody since 18-02-2019, and his bail plea had been rejected by the trial court due to his absence during the consideration of charge. The consideration of charge is a crucial stage in a criminal trial, where the court examines the evidence and decides whether there is a prima facie case against the accused. The absence of the accused during this stage is considered a serious lapse, as it can lead to the denial of a fair trial.

However, the High Court granted Jitul Rabha bail on furnishing a bond of Rs. 15,000 with a suitable surety and subject to conditions to be imposed by the trial court. The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and it is based on various factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence, and the possibility of the accused influencing witnesses.

In this case, the High Court considered the fact that Jitul Rabha had been in custody for a considerable period, and that he had no previous criminal record. The court also took into account the fact that the offence in question was not of a heinous nature, and that the accused was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court, therefore, granted him bail on the condition that he furnishes a bond of Rs. 15,000 with a suitable surety and subject to conditions to be imposed by the trial court.
