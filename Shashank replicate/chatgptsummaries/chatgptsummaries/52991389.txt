In a court order dated December 4, 2014, Judge Vibhu Bakhru ruled on case number RKW.P.(C) No. 3479/2012, in which petitioner Ramesh Kumar challenged an order rejecting his application for an industrial plot under a relocation scheme. The reason for the rejection was that Kumar had failed to establish that he was carrying out manufacturing business prior to April 19, 1996, which was the cut-off date for eligibility.

However, the court found that Kumar had submitted sufficient evidence to indicate that he had an established unit prior to the cut-off date, which had been overlooked by the respondent. As a result, the impugned order was set aside, and the respondent was directed to consider Kumar's application for allotment of an industrial plot in accordance with its policy.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the evidence presented by Kumar. The petitioner had submitted documents such as electricity bills, bank statements, and sales tax returns to establish that he had been carrying out manufacturing business prior to the cut-off date. The court found that these documents were sufficient to prove that Kumar had an established unit prior to April 19, 1996.

The court also noted that the respondent had not given any reasons for rejecting Kumar's application. The court found that this was a violation of the principles of natural justice, which require that reasons be given for any decision that affects the rights of an individual. The court held that the respondent's failure to give reasons for the rejection of Kumar's application was a serious flaw in the decision-making process.

In light of these findings, the court set aside the impugned order and directed the respondent to consider Kumar's application for allotment of an industrial plot in accordance with its policy. The court's decision was a victory for Kumar, who had been unfairly denied the opportunity to relocate his manufacturing business.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support a claim, as well as the need for decision-makers to give reasons for their decisions. The court's ruling also underscores the importance of the principles of natural justice in ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and that their rights are protected.
