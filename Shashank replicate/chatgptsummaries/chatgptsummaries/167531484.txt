The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab, Chandigarh recently heard a complaint filed by Vishnu Kumar against The Sherwood Officers Society and RKM Housing Ltd. Kumar had paid Rs. 19 lakh for a plot of land that was never developed, and he sought a refund, interest, compensation, and litigation expenses. The Society denied the allegations and claimed that Kumar had not paid the full amount due. The Commission allowed both parties to present evidence and ultimately dismissed the complaint against RKM Housing Ltd. The Society also filed an application to dismiss the complaint against them, citing the Societies Registration Act, which was pending at the time of the court order.

In another case, the court order discusses a dispute between a member of a cooperative society and the society itself. The society argued that the Consumer Forum did not have jurisdiction to decide the matter, citing previous judgments. However, the court found that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides an additional remedy and that the Consumer Fora have jurisdiction to entertain complaints related to services provided by cooperative societies. The court also examined the legality of the society's scheme and found that it was not entitled to raise the scheme without the necessary certificates from the relevant departments.

The court order also states that the promoter of a building or colony development must provide specified documents at their office and construction site. If any person suffers loss or damage due to untrue statements in the advertisement or prospectus, the promoter, partners, or directors may be liable for compensation. The court found that the defendants engaged in unfair trade practices and deficiency in service by failing to deliver possession within the agreed time and not obtaining necessary permissions. The complainant is entitled to a refund of their payment with interest, compensation, and litigation costs. The defendants must comply with the order within 45 days.
