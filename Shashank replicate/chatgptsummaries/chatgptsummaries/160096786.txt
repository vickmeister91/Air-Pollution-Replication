In a recent court order, an application for condonation of delay in filing a criminal revision was allowed by the court. The revision had a delay of 623 days, but the court granted the application nonetheless. Additionally, the court allowed an application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail for the petitioner, who had been convicted for an offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000.

The court suspended the remaining part of the sentence and released the petitioner on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety. The case was listed for arguments on admission in the week commencing from 25.6.2018.

The court's decision to allow the application for condonation of delay in filing the criminal revision is significant as it shows the court's willingness to consider the merits of a case despite a delay in filing. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that every litigant be given a fair opportunity to present their case.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner is also significant as it shows the court's willingness to consider the circumstances of the case and the petitioner's personal circumstances. The court's decision to suspend the remaining part of the sentence is also significant as it shows the court's willingness to consider the petitioner's rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife. The Act also provides for the regulation of hunting, trapping, and trade in wildlife and their products.

The offence under the Act for which the petitioner was convicted is a serious one, and the court's decision to grant bail and suspend the remaining part of the sentence should not be seen as a lenient approach to wildlife crimes. Rather, it should be seen as a balanced approach that takes into account the circumstances of the case and the petitioner's personal circumstances.

In conclusion, the court's decision to allow the application for condonation of delay in filing the criminal revision and to grant bail and suspend the remaining part of the sentence for the petitioner is a significant one. It shows the court's willingness to consider the merits of a case despite a delay in filing and to consider the circumstances of the case and the petitioner's personal circumstances. The Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats, and the court's decision should not be seen as a lenient approach to wildlife crimes, but rather as a balanced approach that takes into account the circumstances of the case and the petitioner's personal circumstances.
