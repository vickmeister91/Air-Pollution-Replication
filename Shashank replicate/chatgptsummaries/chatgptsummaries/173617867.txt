In two separate court orders, Manzoor Ahmed was convicted for possessing and selling shawls made from the wool of the Tibetan Antelope, an endangered species protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first court order convicted Ahmed under section 55 of the Act for possessing seven Shahtoosh Shawls, which were seized during a raid on his residence. Ahmed failed to produce any legal source of procurement for the shawls, and after hearing arguments from both the prosecution and defense, the court found him guilty of the offense. The relevant provisions of the Act and the punishment for the offense were also discussed in the court order.

The second court order convicted Ahmed under sections 49 and 49B of the Act for possessing and selling shawls made from the Tibetan Antelope without a license to deal with such articles. The court rejected the defense's argument of false implication and lack of evidence and sentenced Ahmed to imprisonment for a term of not less than three years and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and the conservation of their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trade of endangered species and their products. It also regulates the possession, transportation, and sale of wildlife and their products.

Section 55 of the Act deals with the possession of any wild animal, animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy without a license or permit. The offense is punishable with imprisonment for a term of up to three years or with a fine of up to twenty-five thousand rupees or with both.

Sections 49 and 49B of the Act deal with the sale, purchase, or possession for sale of any animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy without a license or permit. The offense is punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than three years and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.

In both court orders, Ahmed was found guilty of possessing and dealing with shawls made from the wool of the Tibetan Antelope without a license or permit. The Tibetan Antelope is an endangered species, and its wool is highly valued for its softness and warmth. The demand for Shahtoosh Shawls made from the wool of the Tibetan Antelope has led to the poaching of the animal, which has resulted in a decline in its population.

The court orders highlight the importance of enforcing wildlife protection laws to prevent the illegal trade of endangered species and their products. The conviction of Ahmed sends a strong message to others involved in the illegal trade of wildlife that such activities will not be tolerated and will be punished under the law.

In conclusion, the court orders convicting Manzoor Ahmed for possessing and selling shawls made from the wool of the Tibetan Antelope without a license or permit under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, highlight the importance of enforcing wildlife protection laws to prevent the illegal trade of endangered species and their products. The punishment handed down to Ahmed sends a strong message to others involved in the illegal trade of wildlife that such activities will not be tolerated and will be punished under the law.
