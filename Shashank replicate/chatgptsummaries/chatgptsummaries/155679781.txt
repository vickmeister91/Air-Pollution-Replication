The first court order pertains to the case of Iqbal Amarsang Vaghela, who was granted regular bail in relation to an FIR registered against him for offences under the Gujarat Prohibition Act and the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution had alleged that a CNG rickshaw driven by Vaghela was intercepted and found to contain a large quantity of English liquor. However, the court noted that Vaghela had no criminal antecedents and was a resident of Gujarat, and therefore granted him bail with strict conditions.

The conditions of the bail included a solvent surety of Rs. 25,000 and regular reporting to the police station. Additionally, the court ordered Vaghela not to contact any co-accused and not to enter the district of Vadodara until the filing of the charge sheet. These conditions were imposed to ensure that Vaghela did not tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses in the case.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail to Vaghela was based on several factors, including his lack of criminal antecedents and his status as a resident of Gujarat. The court also took into account the nature of the offence and the evidence presented by the prosecution. By imposing strict conditions on Vaghela's bail, the court sought to balance the interests of justice with the rights of the accused.
