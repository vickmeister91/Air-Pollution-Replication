The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the acquisition of agricultural lands for industrial development in ecologically sensitive areas in Karnataka, India. The petitioners in each case argue that the proposed industrial activity would pollute the water sources meant for the supply of drinking water to Bangalore City. The court considers the impact on the environment and the change of land use pattern from the one mentioned in the Master Plan. The court also refers to previous judgments on environmental protection and pollution control, ecology, and town planning vis-a-vis industrial activity.

In the first case, the petitioners seek to quash notifications issued by the State Government for the acquisition of their agricultural lands for the benefit of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) for the formation of the Somapur Industrial Area. The court considers the impact on the environment and the change of land use pattern from the one mentioned in the Master Plan. The court also refers to previous judgments on environmental protection and pollution control, ecology, and town planning vis-a-vis industrial activity. The court emphasizes the need to protect the Thippagondanahalli Reservoir Catchment Area (TGR) and ensure that any development in the area is in compliance with environmental regulations.

In the second case, the court discusses the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development. The Public Trust Doctrine is explained, which states that certain resources like air, sea, waters, and forests should be made freely available to everyone and protected by the government for the enjoyment of the general public. The court directs that before acquiring lands for development, the consequences and adverse impact of development on the environment must be properly comprehended, and lands should not gravely impair the ecology and environment. The court also directs the appellant to incorporate the condition of allotment to obtain clearance from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board before the land is allotted for development.

In the third case, the court discusses the issue of environmental clearance for a proposed industrial estate in the TGR Catchment area, which is a source of drinking water for Bangalore and surrounding areas. The court considers the recommendations made by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to regulate development in the catchment area and protect it from contamination. The court also cites a notification issued by the Government of Karnataka in 2003, which places restrictions on different kinds of activities in the catchment area and specifies the authorities responsible for regulating them. Overall, the court order emphasizes the need to protect the TGR catchment area and ensure that any development in the area is in compliance with environmental regulations.

In the fourth case, the validity of notifications issued by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) declaring certain areas as industrial zones was challenged. The court found that the lands in question were located in ecologically sensitive areas and were in the catchment area of a drinking water source for Bangalore. The court held that the KIADB had not complied with the direction of the Supreme Court to properly comprehend the consequences and adverse impact of development on the environment before acquiring lands for development. The court quashed the notifications insofar as the petitioners' lands were concerned.

In all of these cases, the court emphasizes the need to protect the environment and ensure that any development in ecologically sensitive areas is in compliance with environmental regulations. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the need to properly comprehend the consequences and adverse impact of development on the environment before acquiring lands for development. These court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development in India.
