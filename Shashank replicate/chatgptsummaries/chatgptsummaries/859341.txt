The Madras High Court recently passed a judgment in two criminal revision cases filed by H. Mohamed Ibrahim Kaleel, Hawa Beevi, Shajitha Banu, Mumtaj Beham, Hairunnisha, and Sheik Mohideen against the State, represented by the Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station. The cases were filed against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Pudukottai, in Crl.M.P.Nos.540 and 398 of 2007 in C.C.No.509 of 2004.

The court analyzed the allegations made against the accused and the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate, Pudukottai, and concluded that the order passed in Crl.M.P.No.398 of 2007 was erroneous and liable to be set aside. The court also analyzed the provisions of Section 91(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and held that it cannot be invoked against the accused.

The court order pertains to a search warrant issued by the Judicial Magistrate, Pudukottai, which was challenged by the accused. The court ruled that Section 91(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be invoked against the accused and therefore, the search warrant was set aside. The court also ruled that the Judicial Magistrate had no jurisdiction to look into the alleged culpability of the accused and discharged them from the proceedings. The complainant was given the option to lodge a fresh complaint in the appropriate police station.

The court analyzed the provisions of Section 91(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing. The court held that this provision cannot be invoked against the accused as it is meant to be used only against third parties who are not accused in the case. The court also held that the accused cannot be compelled to produce any document or other thing that may incriminate them.

The court further analyzed the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate, Pudukottai, and held that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to look into the alleged culpability of the accused. The court held that the magistrate can only look into the question of whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed against the accused and whether the accused should be discharged or committed to trial. The court held that the magistrate had exceeded his jurisdiction by looking into the culpability of the accused.

The court also analyzed the allegations made against the accused and held that there was no prima facie case against them. The court held that the allegations were vague and lacked specificity. The court held that the accused cannot be compelled to face trial on vague and unspecific allegations.

The court, therefore, set aside the order passed in Crl.M.P.No.398 of 2007 and discharged the accused from the proceedings. The court also set aside the search warrant issued by the Judicial Magistrate, Pudukottai, and held that the complainant was free to lodge a fresh complaint in the appropriate police station.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court has passed a judgment in two criminal revision cases filed by H. Mohamed Ibrahim Kaleel, Hawa Beevi, Shajitha Banu, Mumtaj Beham, Hairunnisha, and Sheik Mohideen against the State, represented by the Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station.
