In a recent court order, Rafiq Ahmad was acquitted of charges of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by trading live wild birds without a license. The prosecution had alleged that he was found in possession of 50 live Rose ringed Parakeets and 35 live Black headed Munias, both of which are protected under the Act. However, the court found several material contradictions in the prosecution's case and acquitted the accused.

The court noted that the place of the raid was not clear, and there were doubts about the recovery of the birds. Additionally, no public witness was joined to the prosecution case. These discrepancies led the court to conclude that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the accused.

The defense argued that the recovery of evidence was from an open place and not linked to the accused. The court also noted that the Evidence Act's Section 27 did not apply in this case. As a result, the accused was acquitted of the charges, and the case property was confiscated to the state. Bail bonds were canceled, and the file was consigned to the record room.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or trading of wild animals and birds without a license. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the prosecution had alleged that Rafiq Ahmad was trading live wild birds without a license, which is a violation of the Act. However, the court found that the prosecution's case was riddled with discrepancies and lacked an independent witness. The court also noted that the recovery of evidence was from an open place and not linked to the accused.

The court's decision to acquit the accused highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that evidence is collected and presented in a manner that is consistent with the law. The court's decision also underscores the need for independent witnesses to be joined to the prosecution case to ensure that the evidence presented is reliable and credible.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and ensuring that those who violate the law are held accountable. However, it also highlights the need for due process and the importance of collecting and presenting evidence in a manner that is consistent with the law. Ultimately, the court's decision to acquit the accused underscores the importance of ensuring that justice is served in a fair and impartial manner.
