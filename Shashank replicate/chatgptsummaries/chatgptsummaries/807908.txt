In a recent court order, the plaintiffs claimed ownership of one-fourth of the water flowing through Yellareddi Kalva into the Anumakondapallem Tank. The court found that the plaintiffs' right to one-fourth of the water was established in a previous lawsuit, and therefore, they were exempt from paying water-cess. The government argued that even if the plaintiffs' ownership to one-fourth of the water was proved, it would not be sufficient to exempt them from paying water-cess. However, the court held that if there was a contract or grant by virtue of which the plaintiffs became entitled to one-fourth of the water, it would be unreasonable to suppose that the government would still be entitled to levy a cess as remuneration for the water.

The court also held that the government was not entitled to charge water-cess for the use of water that belonged to the landowner. The court reversed the District Judge's decree and restored that of the District Munsif. This decision has significant implications for landowners and water users in the region.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the government cannot charge a cess for the use of water that belongs to the landowner. This principle is rooted in the idea that the landowner has a right to the water that flows through their land, and the government cannot charge them for using it. This principle is particularly important in areas where water is scarce, and landowners rely on the water for their livelihoods.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of contracts and grants in determining ownership of water. If there is a contract or grant that entitles a person to a share of the water, then the government cannot charge them for using it. This is because the contract or grant establishes their right to the water, and the government cannot charge them for something that they already own.

The court's decision has significant implications for landowners and water users in the region. Landowners who have contracts or grants that entitle them to a share of the water can now use the water without paying water-cess. This will be a significant relief for many landowners who rely on the water for their livelihoods.

The court's decision also has implications for the government. The government will now have to be more careful in levying water-cess. They cannot charge landowners for using water that belongs to them, and they cannot charge landowners who have contracts or grants that entitle them to a share of the water.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertaining to the ownership of water flowing through Yellareddi Kalva into the Anumakondapallem Tank has significant implications for landowners and water users in the region. The court's decision is based on the principle that the government cannot charge a cess for the use of water that belongs to the landowner. The decision also highlights the importance of contracts and grants in determining ownership of water. Landowners who have contracts or grants that entitle them to a share of the water can now use the water without paying water-cess. This will be a significant relief for many landowners who rely on the water for their livelihoods. The government will now have to be more careful in levying water-cess, and cannot charge landowners for using water that belongs to them.
