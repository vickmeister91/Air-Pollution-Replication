In a recent court hearing, three bail applications were presented to the judge, all related to the same crime number involving the offence of possessing tiger skin under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants claimed innocence and lack of criminal antecedents, and the court found no prima facie evidence of their involvement in hunting the tiger. As a result, the court granted bail on a bond of Rs. 30,000.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on the lack of evidence linking the applicants to the crime. The applicants claimed that they had no involvement in the hunting of the tiger and that they were innocent of the charges against them. The court found no evidence to contradict their claims and therefore granted bail.

The bail was granted on the condition that the applicants furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety each. Additionally, the applicants must appear before the court on the given dates and comply with Section 437 (3) Cr.P.C. C.C. as per rules. This means that the applicants must attend all court hearings and comply with any other conditions set by the court.

The court's decision to grant bail is significant as it allows the applicants to be released from custody while they await trial. This is important as it ensures that the applicants are not held in custody for an extended period of time without being convicted of a crime. It also allows them to continue with their daily lives while they await trial.

However, it is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that the applicants are innocent of the charges against them. It simply means that they have been granted temporary release from custody while they await trial. The court will still need to determine whether or not the applicants are guilty of the charges against them.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the three applicants in the tiger skin possession case was based on the lack of evidence linking them to the crime. The bail was granted on the condition that the applicants comply with certain rules and attend all court hearings. While the granting of bail allows the applicants to be released from custody, it does not mean that they are innocent of the charges against them. The court will still need to determine their guilt or innocence in due course.
