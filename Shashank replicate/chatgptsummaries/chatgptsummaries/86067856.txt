The case at hand involves a petitioner who challenged an order passed by the second respondent, which prohibited him from entering his leasehold land through the Tiger Reserve Forest. The petitioner argued that he had a right to access the land through a pathway that had been used for several decades. The respondents argued that the petitioner was attempting to engage in large-scale commercial activity that would damage the fauna and flora of the tiger habitat.

The court examined Section 27 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which allows a person with any right over immovable property within the limits of the sanctuary to enter or reside in the sanctuary. The court found that the petitioner had a right to access his leasehold land and quashed the impugned order.

The court order states that individuals who do not fall under certain categories must obtain a permit to enter or reside in the sanctuary. However, those who have rights over immovable property within the sanctuary do not need a permit, but may have certain restrictions. The owner of a land can exercise their rights over the land, but the Collector may acquire the land or right.

In this case, the petitioner's leasehold land has been declared a "Critical Tiger Habitat," but there is no statutory embargo preventing the petitioner from exercising their rights. The court states that no administrative order can override statutory provisions or rules. The first respondent has proposed to acquire the lands, but until the land is acquired, the owner's right to access through the sanctuary cannot be denied.

The petitioner cannot be discriminated against when others are using the pathway to access their registered patta lands. The court sets aside the impugned order and closes the case.

Overall, the court's decision in this case upholds the rights of landowners within the sanctuary and ensures that administrative orders do not override statutory provisions or rules. The court recognizes the importance of protecting the tiger habitat, but also acknowledges the rights of individuals who have legal rights over immovable property within the sanctuary. The decision serves as a reminder that conservation efforts must be balanced with the protection of individual rights.
