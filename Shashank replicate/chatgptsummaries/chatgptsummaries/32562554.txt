Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) allows the court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C. requires the investigating officer to furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of the police report along with all documents and statements recorded during the investigation.

In this case, the accused had requested the summoning of various documents that were not filed on court record by the investigating officer. However, the court ruled that the IO is not supposed to collect evidence on behalf of the accused persons. This means that it is the responsibility of the accused to provide evidence to support their case, and the IO is not obligated to collect evidence on their behalf.

The court's decision to dismiss the application highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and the role of the investigating officer in collecting evidence. It also emphasizes the need for accused persons to take an active role in their defense and to provide evidence to support their case.

It is important to note that the accused persons in this case are currently out on bail. Bail is a legal process that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused person will appear in court when required and will not commit any further offenses while on bail.

The case is set to be put up for order on framing of charge on 18.2.2014. Framing of charge is the process by which the court decides whether there is enough evidence to proceed with a trial. If the court finds that there is enough evidence, it will frame charges against the accused and the trial will proceed.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the application filed by the accused Anjeet Kumar Sankhla highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and the role of the investigating officer in collecting evidence. It also emphasizes the need for accused persons to take an active role in their defense and to provide evidence to support their case.
