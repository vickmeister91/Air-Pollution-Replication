The Calcutta High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by a petitioner on the grounds that the petitioner had not exhausted all alternative remedies available to them. The court had previously disposed of a similar petition on the same subject matter and had directed the petitioner to file an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Operation) Act, 1981. The court dismissed the writ petition with liberty to the petitioner to seek alternative remedy in accordance with the law.

The petitioner had filed the writ petition seeking a direction to the respondents to take necessary steps to control air pollution caused by the operation of a particular factory. The petitioner had also sought a direction to the respondents to take action against the factory for violating the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Operation) Act, 1981.

The court noted that the petitioner had not filed an appeal under Section 31 of the Act, which provides for an appeal against an order made by the State Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted all alternative remedies available to them before approaching the court.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any representation to the State Pollution Control Board regarding the alleged violation of the provisions of the Act by the factory. The court noted that the petitioner had not even approached the Board for a hearing on the matter.

The court held that the petitioner had not followed the proper procedure for seeking relief under the Act. The court observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to exhaust all alternative remedies available to them before approaching the court. The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition with liberty to the petitioner to seek alternative remedy in accordance with the law.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting all alternative remedies available to a petitioner before approaching the court. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for petitioners to follow the proper procedure for seeking relief under the law.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's decision to dismiss the writ petition filed by the petitioner serves as a reminder to all petitioners to exhaust all alternative remedies available to them before approaching the court. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the proper procedure for seeking relief under the law.
