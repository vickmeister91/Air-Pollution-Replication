The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the criminal proceeding against the petitioners in B.F. Case No. 49 of 2003 lodged under Sections 33, 41 and 42 of the Indian Forest Act read with Section 2, 3(A) and 3(B) for contravention of the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The prosecution report stated that the petitioners had extracted and mined coal from the Ghanudih protected forest area.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately quashed the entire criminal proceeding, including the order taking cognizance of the offences against the petitioners, as it would amount to an abuse of the process of the court. The court found that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the petitioners and that the allegations made against them were vague and general in nature.

The court noted that the petitioners had been falsely implicated in the case and that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to support the charges against them. The court also observed that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure for obtaining sanction for prosecution under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court further held that the prosecution had not complied with the mandatory provisions of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires prior sanction of the government before prosecuting a public servant for an offence committed during the discharge of his official duties. The court found that the petitioners were public servants at the relevant time and that the prosecution had not obtained the necessary sanction for their prosecution.

The court also took note of the fact that the petitioners had already retired from service and that the criminal proceeding against them had been pending for a long time. The court observed that the continuation of the criminal proceeding would cause undue harassment and mental agony to the petitioners and that it would serve no useful purpose.

In light of these findings, the court quashed the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners and directed that the chargesheet and all other documents related to the case be destroyed. The court also directed that the petitioners be discharged from the case and that their bail bonds be cancelled.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to the quashing of a criminal proceeding against the petitioners in B.F. Case No. 49 of 2003 lodged under Sections 33, 41 and 42 of the Indian Forest Act read with Section 2, 3(A) and 3(B) for contravention of the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court found that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the petitioners and that the allegations made against them were vague and general in nature. The court also held that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure for obtaining sanction for prosecution under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and that it had not complied with the mandatory provisions of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court quashed the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners and directed that the chargesheet and all other documents related to the case be destroyed.
