The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Sachin Industries against the Commissioner of Mysore City Corporation. The petitioner had obtained a certificate of Importer-Exporter Code and was registered as a small manufacturer of plastic products. However, the Health Officer of the Mysore City Corporation had seized 1.75 tons of table rolls from the petitioner's industry on the premise that it violated the provisions of the Plastic (Manufacture, Usage and Waste Management) Rules, 2009.

The petitioner argued that the seizure of the plastic rolls was illegal, arbitrary, and unjustified. The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and declared the seizure of plastic rolls as illegal, arbitrary, and unjustified. The court also directed the respondent-MCC to pay the petitioner costs of Rs.20,000/- to be recovered from the salary of the Commissioner and the Officers concerned.

Furthermore, the court directed the Principal Secretary of Urban Development Authority to hold an enquiry into the alleged seizure and record findings, including persons responsible for the same. If found guilty, the court directed the authorities to direct their removal from service or other commensurate punishment.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of small manufacturers and businesses against arbitrary and unjustified seizures by government authorities. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions of the law while enforcing regulations.
