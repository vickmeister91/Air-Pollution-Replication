The Wild Life Protection Act is a law enacted by the Indian government to protect wildlife and their habitats. It provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The Act has been amended several times since its enactment in 1972, with the latest amendment being in 2006.

Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, and provides that whoever hunts any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, or IV shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Schedule I of the Act includes animals such as tigers, lions, and elephants, while Schedule II includes animals such as leopards, bears, and rhinoceroses.

Section 39/51 of the Act deals with the power of the authorities to arrest and seize property. It provides that any forest officer or police officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector may, without a warrant, arrest any person who has committed an offence under the Act, or who is reasonably suspected of having committed such an offence. The officer may also seize any property which he has reason to believe has been used for committing the offence, or which is likely to be used for committing any offence under the Act.
