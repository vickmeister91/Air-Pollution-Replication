The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by M/S.Pampra Coffee Plantations against the State of Kerala. The first writ petition challenges the vesting of private forest land under the Kerala Private Forest [Vesting & Assignment] Act 1971. The petitioner claims to be the absolute owner in possession of an extent of 825.38 Acres of property purchased in 1975. The court heard the matter comprehensively and reserved judgment in both writ petitions. The petitioner's property, being a plantation, was excluded from vesting even as per the Vesting Act. The court order includes a list of exhibits presented by both the petitioner and the respondents.

The second writ petition discusses a dispute over the ownership of a property known as the Pambra Estate, which was previously used for coffee cultivation. The petitioner had sought clearfelling of a portion of the estate and had subsequently been granted registration and exemption from ceiling area restrictions. However, a notification was later issued by the government vesting certain properties in the estate, which the petitioner contested. The court notes that the notification process should have been prompt and argues against an unending exercise of measurement and demarcation.
