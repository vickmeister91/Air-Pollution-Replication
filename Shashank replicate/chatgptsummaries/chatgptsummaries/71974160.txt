In a recent court order, the applicant, Mukesh Vyas, had sought a document under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C), which was not available with the police authority. The applicant had requested that the case diary be obtained to check if there was any reference to the document. The court directed the Government Advocate (GA) for the respondent/State to call for the case diary and listed the matter for hearing after two weeks.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C empowers a court to issue a summons or order to a person in possession of any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also allows the court to direct the person to produce the document or thing before the court or to send it to the court.

In this case, the applicant had sought a document that was not available with the police authority. The court, therefore, directed the GA for the respondent/State to call for the case diary to check if there was any reference to the document. The case diary is a record maintained by the investigating officer of all the proceedings in the investigation of a case. It contains details of the investigation, such as the statements of witnesses, the progress of the investigation, and any other relevant information.

The court's direction to call for the case diary is significant as it shows that the court is willing to use its powers under section 91 to ensure that the applicant gets access to the document he has requested. The court has also listed the matter for hearing after two weeks, indicating that it is taking the matter seriously and wants to ensure that justice is done.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of section 91 of the Cr.P.C in ensuring that justice is done in criminal cases. It also shows that the court is willing to use its powers to ensure that the parties involved in a case have access to all the necessary documents and information.
