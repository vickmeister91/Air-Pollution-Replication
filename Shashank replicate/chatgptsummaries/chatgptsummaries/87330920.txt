Dr. Ayesha Noorulayen Taskeen had filed two criminal petitions under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate rejecting her two applications filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner had sought to summon the income tax returns for the year 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 filed by the respondent-husband and another for directing the respondent to produce the TDS certificates for those relevant years issued by the different hospitals. The petitioner had claimed that these documents were relevant to establish the income of the respondent to determine the quantum of maintenance that could be ordered by the court.

However, the learned Magistrate had rejected the applications mainly on the ground that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that she had made efforts to secure copies of the documents from the concerned department or the hospital and that the concerned authorities have refused to furnish the copies thereof. The court had observed that the documents sought to be summoned were necessary for proper decision in the matter and that a fresh cause-of-action had arisen to the petitioner to renew her request before the learned Magistrate on this basis and seek summoning of the documents.

The case revolved around the issue of maintenance and the determination of the quantum of maintenance that could be ordered by the court. The petitioner had sought to establish the income of the respondent-husband through the income tax returns and TDS certificates for the relevant years. The learned Magistrate had rejected the applications on the ground that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that she had made efforts to secure copies of the documents from the concerned department or the hospital and that the concerned authorities have refused to furnish the copies thereof.

The court had observed that the documents sought to be summoned were necessary for proper decision in the matter and that a fresh cause-of-action had arisen to the petitioner to renew her request before the learned Magistrate on this basis and seek summoning of the documents. The court had also noted that the petitioner had a right to seek the documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C and that the learned Magistrate had erred in rejecting the applications.

The court had further observed that the learned Magistrate had failed to appreciate the fact that the petitioner had a right to seek the documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C and that the learned Magistrate had erred in rejecting the applications. The court had also noted that the petitioner had made a prima facie case for summoning the documents and that the learned Magistrate had not given any reasons for rejecting the applications.

In conclusion, the court had set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate rejecting the two applications filed by the petitioner under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C and had directed the learned Magistrate to consider the applications afresh and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. The court had also directed the respondent-husband to produce the income tax returns for the year 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 and the TDS certificates for those relevant years issued by the different hospitals before the learned Magistrate. The court had emphasized that the documents sought to be summoned were necessary for proper decision in the matter and that the learned Magistrate should consider the applications afresh and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.
