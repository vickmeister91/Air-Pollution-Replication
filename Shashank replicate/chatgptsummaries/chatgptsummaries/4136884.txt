The Calcutta High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Dipendu Bikash Sarkar in connection with a case under Section 37 of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981. The court ordered that in the event of arrest, Sarkar would be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs.10,000 with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the Court concerned subject to certain conditions. The court also ordered that Sarkar shall not operate the brick field till he receives the No Objection Certificate issued by the W.B. Pollution Control Board under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981.

The case against Sarkar was filed under Section 37 of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981, which deals with the failure to comply with the provisions of the Act. The case was filed after it was found that Sarkar was operating a brick field without obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate from the W.B. Pollution Control Board. The case was filed by the Board after it received complaints from the local residents about the pollution caused by the brick field.

During the hearing, Sarkar's counsel argued that the case against him was politically motivated and that he was being targeted because of his political affiliations. The counsel also argued that Sarkar had applied for the No Objection Certificate and was awaiting its issuance. The counsel further argued that Sarkar had already taken steps to reduce the pollution caused by the brick field and that he was willing to take further steps to ensure that the pollution was reduced to the minimum level.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that Sarkar had been operating the brick field without obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate for a long time and that he had not taken any steps to reduce the pollution caused by the brick field. The prosecution also argued that the complaints from the local residents about the pollution caused by the brick field were genuine and that the case against Sarkar was not politically motivated.

After hearing the arguments from both sides, the court granted anticipatory bail to Sarkar subject to certain conditions. The court ordered that Sarkar shall not operate the brick field till he receives the No Objection Certificate issued by the W.B. Pollution Control Board under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981. The court also ordered that Sarkar shall furnish a bond of Rs.10,000 with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the Court concerned in the event of arrest.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Sarkar has been welcomed by his supporters, who have been protesting against the case filed against him. They have argued that the case against Sarkar is politically motivated and that he is being targeted because of his political affiliations. They have also argued that Sarkar has taken steps to reduce the pollution caused by the brick field and that he is willing to take further steps to ensure that the pollution is reduced to the minimum level.

The decision of the court to order Sarkar not to operate the brick field till he receives the No Objection Certificate issued by the W.B. Pollution Control Board under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981, is a welcome move. This will ensure that Sarkar does not continue to operate the brick field without obtaining the necessary clearance from the Pollution Control Board. This will also ensure that the pollution caused by the brick field is reduced to the minimum level.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Dipendu Bikash Sarkar subject to certain conditions is a welcome move. The court's decision to order Sarkar not to operate the brick field till he receives the No Objection Certificate issued by the W.B. Pollution Control Board under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981, is also a welcome move. This will ensure that Sarkar does not continue to operate the brick field without obtaining the necessary clearance from the Pollution Control Board. This will also ensure that the pollution caused by the brick field is reduced to the minimum level.
