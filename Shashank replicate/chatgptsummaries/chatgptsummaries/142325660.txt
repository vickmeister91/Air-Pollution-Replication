In a recent court order, a petition filed by Subhash Chand against Ram Niwas Chahar and another person was rejected. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. claiming that the complainant had returned the original pronote or receipt to him. However, the court found that the complainant's claim was not genuine and that it was not possible for the court to issue directions for the production of the documents.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the complainant had not provided any evidence to support his claim that he had returned the original pronote or receipt to the petitioner. In addition, the court noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the complainant had not returned the original pronote or receipt to him.

As a result, the court concluded that it was not possible to issue directions for the production of the documents. Instead, the trial court will decide the effect of non-production of the documents at the time of the final decision.

The court's decision highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in court. Without evidence, it is difficult for the court to make a decision and issue directions for the production of documents.

Overall, the petition was disposed of with the direction that the trial court will decide the effect of non-production of the documents at the time of the final decision. This decision serves as a reminder to litigants to provide evidence to support their claims in court.
