The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard a case (CWP No. 12123 of 2020) in which M/s Muskan Trading Company had applied for a license to operate a stone crusher in village Baded, District Nuh. The petitioner was initially granted a license to operate the stone crusher from 2010 to 2013 and then applied for a renewal of the license. The license was granted with certain conditions, including compliance with pollution control laws and minimum wage laws. However, the stone crusher was inspected by the Central Empowered Committee and found to be operated by M/s Shiv Grit Suppliers without a valid license. The Director served a show cause notice to the petitioner, and after receiving a reply, the Director found that the petitioner had let out the stone crusher to M/s Shiv Grit Suppliers without a license. The Director ordered the suspension of crushing operations to be revoked, but both the petitioner and M/s Shiv Grit Suppliers were found liable for penal action under the law.

The court order pertains to the cancellation of a stone crusher license issued to a petitioner for operating a crusher without obtaining the necessary license. The order also mentions the cancellation of the license of a proprietorship firm for facilitating the operation of the crusher by letting out the crusher to an entity without a valid license. The petitioner has challenged the cancellation of their license, arguing that they did not violate the terms and conditions of the license. The court has directed strict compliance with related provisions and laws and allowed the resumption of operations subject to the outcome of a complaint filed against the petitioner.

The court order discusses a case where a license issued under Section 3 of the Act cannot be cancelled under Rules 5(3) of the Rules if there is no breach of condition on the part of the licensee. The court also discusses whether a licensee commits a breach of condition and remedies the breach within a period of 30 days of the issuance of notice by the Director, whether the Director would still have the jurisdiction to cancel the license. The court concludes that the Director had no jurisdiction to cancel the license in this case. The court also discusses whether the order dated 20.09.2018 passed by the Director can be challenged by reopening the same issue and whether the petitioner has a remedy of an appeal in terms of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act. The court allows the writ petition filed by the petitioner and quashes the impugned order dated 06.08.2020.

In summary, the court order deals with the cancellation of a stone crusher license issued to M/s Muskan Trading Company for operating a crusher without obtaining the necessary license. The court found that the Director had no jurisdiction to cancel the license in this case, and the petitioner was allowed to resume operations subject to the outcome of a complaint filed against them. The court also discussed the issue of whether a licensee commits a breach of condition and remedies the breach within a period of 30 days of the issuance of notice by the Director, whether the Director would still have the jurisdiction to cancel the license.
