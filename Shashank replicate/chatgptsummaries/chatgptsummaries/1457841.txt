The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sharanjit Singh against the State of Punjab and others regarding the setting up of a rice sheller in violation of environmental norms. The government had issued an order stipulating norms for setting up new rice shellers and saila plants in the state of Punjab to reduce air pollution and traffic hazards. However, respondent No. 7 had set up a rice sheller within 500 meters of a scheduled road, violating the norms. The government later allowed the sheller to be set up in relaxation of the norms subject to the court's decision.

The court directed the parties to file affidavits regarding the legality of the construction and expenditure incurred by respondent No. 7. It was found that the construction was illegal as no plans were submitted or sanctioned by the competent authority. The government had not noticed this aspect and had allowed the sheller to be set up in relaxation of the norms without applying its mind.

The court order states that the government did not properly evaluate the claim made by respondent No. 7 regarding their investment in a project before the issue of a show cause notice by the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The court also notes that the documents presented by respondent No. 7 to support their claim need to be evaluated for their genuineness.

The court orders the government to issue appropriate directions to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and to take action against officers who provided factually wrong reports. The court quashes the order permitting the setting up of respondent No. 7's unit in relaxation of siting guidelines and remands the matter back to the government to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law. The unit is allowed to operate for four months to dispose of paddy stocks accumulated by it.

The court order is a significant development in the ongoing battle against environmental pollution in the state of Punjab. The court has taken a strong stance against the violation of environmental norms and has directed the government to take appropriate action to prevent similar situations from arising in the future.

The court has also highlighted the need for proper evaluation of claims made by companies before the issue of show cause notices by regulatory bodies. This is an important step towards ensuring that companies are held accountable for their actions and that they are not allowed to violate environmental norms with impunity.

The court's decision to quash the order permitting the setting up of respondent No. 7's unit in relaxation of siting guidelines is a clear message to companies that they cannot flout environmental norms and expect to get away with it. The court's decision to remand the matter back to the government to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental norms are upheld and that companies are held accountable for their actions.

The court's decision to allow the unit to operate for four months to dispose of paddy stocks accumulated by it is a pragmatic approach that takes into account the practical difficulties that may arise from shutting down the unit immediately. This decision also ensures that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account and that the unit is given a reasonable amount of time to wind down its operations.

Overall, the court order is a positive development in the ongoing battle against environmental pollution in the state of Punjab. The court has taken a strong stance against the violation of environmental norms and has directed the government to take appropriate action to prevent similar situations from arising in the future. The court's decision to quash the order permitting the setting up of respondent No. 7's unit in relaxation of siting guidelines is a clear message to companies that they cannot flout environmental norms and expect to get away with it.
