The court has disposed of the petition with liberty to the petitioners to apply for license under the Municipal Corporation Act or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981 on or before 10th of May, 2017.

The petitioners, who are dairy farm owners, had approached the court seeking a direction to the District Administration to furnish all the material record pertaining to the demolition of five to six dairy farms carried out on 03.05.2017. The petitioners had claimed that the demolition was carried out without any notice or opportunity to be heard, and that the District Administration had not provided any reasons for the same.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, disposed of the petition with liberty to the petitioners to apply for license under the Municipal Corporation Act or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981 on or before 10th of May, 2017. The court also directed the respondents to furnish all the material record pertaining to the demolition of the dairy farms to the petitioners within a period of two weeks.

The court observed that the petitioners had not obtained the necessary licenses or consents under the relevant laws, and that the demolition was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law. The court also noted that the petitioners had not challenged the validity of the relevant laws, and that they were bound by the same.

The court further observed that the petitioners had the option to apply for the necessary licenses or consents under the relevant laws, and that they could not claim any right to continue their dairy farms without complying with the same. The court also noted that the respondents had not carried out any demolition activities after the filing of the petition, and that they had given an undertaking to the court to not carry out any such activities till 10.05.2017.

The court, therefore, disposed of the petition with liberty to the petitioners to apply for license under the Municipal Corporation Act or consent under the Act of 1974 and the Act of 1981 on or before 10th of May, 2017. The court also directed the respondents to furnish all the material record pertaining to the demolition of the dairy farms to the petitioners within a period of two weeks. If the dairy farm owners do not apply for the license or consent on or before 10.05.2017, the respondents would be at liberty to proceed against the dairy farms in accordance with law, but till 10.05.2017 the respondents will not carry out any demolition activities.
