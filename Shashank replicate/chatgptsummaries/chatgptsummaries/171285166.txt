The Gujarat High Court has issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Biren Rameshchandra Pandya against the State of Gujarat and five others. The petitioner has challenged the creation of a safari park of 400 hectares over reserved forest in the eco-sensitive zone of Gir National Park and Sanctuary. The petitioner has prayed for an appropriate writ, order, or direction to declare the Ambardi Reserved Forest Area as a protected area under Chapter IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and to have a uniform policy/guidelines for protection/conservation of reserved forests in the area considered as Asiatic Lion Landscape by the Gujarat Forest Department.

The court has examined the contentions raised by both parties and has observed that at this stage, it cannot be said that the action taken by the respondent-Government of creating Safari Park/Large Zoo is in any manner contrary to law. However, the court has issued certain conditions that must be fulfilled before the Safari Park can be opened to visitors. The petitioner's concerns about the impact on Asiatic lions and violation of environmental laws can be considered by the Central Zoo Authority.

The court order states that permission to create a Safari Park in Ambardi-Dhari of Gir Reserved Forest is conditional upon fulfilling 12 enumerated conditions. The State Government must obtain recognition from the Central Zoo Authority before the Safari Park can be opened to visitors. The court has rejected the petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court has taken into consideration the fact that the area in question is an eco-sensitive zone and is home to the Asiatic lion, which is an endangered species. The court has also noted that the State Government has taken certain steps to ensure the protection of the environment and the wildlife in the area. However, the court has also observed that there is a need for a uniform policy/guidelines for protection/conservation of reserved forests in the area considered as Asiatic Lion Landscape by the Gujarat Forest Department.

The court has issued certain conditions that must be fulfilled before the Safari Park can be opened to visitors. These conditions include obtaining recognition from the Central Zoo Authority, ensuring that the Safari Park does not have any adverse impact on the environment and the wildlife in the area, and ensuring that the Safari Park is not used for any commercial purposes.

The court has also observed that the concerns raised by the petitioner regarding the impact of the Safari Park on the Asiatic lion and the violation of environmental laws can be considered by the Central Zoo Authority. The court has directed the State Government to ensure that the concerns raised by the petitioner are addressed by the Central Zoo Authority.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Gujarat High Court in response to the writ petition filed by Biren Rameshchandra Pandya against the State of Gujarat and five others has laid down certain conditions that must be fulfilled before the Safari Park can be opened to visitors. The court has also directed the State Government to ensure that the concerns raised by the petitioner regarding the impact of the Safari Park on the Asiatic lion and the violation of environmental laws are addressed by the Central Zoo Authority.
