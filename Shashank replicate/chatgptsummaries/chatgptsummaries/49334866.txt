On June 25, 2019, the Madras High Court issued a court order regarding six writ petitions filed by various metal companies against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the District Environmental Engineer. The petitions requested a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to inspect the petitioner-units and afford them a reasonable opportunity to submit their compliance status before passing final orders in accordance with the law. The court order lists the details of each petitioner and respondent involved in the case.

One of the petitions involved stone crushing units operated by the petitioner-Units, which were classified as "non-area" lands. There were more than 13 other stone crushers being operated with the consent of the respondent-TNPCB. The petitioner-Units had obtained consent from various authorities but did not obtain consent from the TNPCB until 2008. The respondent-TNPCB issued a closure notice stating that the petitioner-Units were being operated without valid consent from the TNPCB and did not install adequate air pollution control measures. The petitioner-Units and other units installed necessary air pollution control measures. The court ordered the inspection of the petitioner-Units to ensure compliance with the Show Cause Notice.

In another petition, the petitioner-Units, who run stone crushing units, were granted renewal of consent by the respondent-TNPCB after inspections and compliance with pollution control measures. However, the Border Security Force (BSF) was allotted land adjacent to the petitioner-Units in 2015, and in April 2019, the BSF complained to the respondent-Board officials about air pollution caused by the stone crushing units. The respondent issued show cause notices to the petitioner-Units for violating consent conditions related to air pollution control measures. The petitioner-Units gave a reply stating that they would improve pollution control measures and submit an action taken report. The respondent-TNPCB passed a closure order under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including disconnection of power supply. The only remedy available to the petitioner-Units was to file an appeal before the appropriate authority under the said Act.

The court order stated that the petitioner-Units submitted that the closure order was passed during the pendency of the present Writ Petitions and inspection was conducted before passing the closure order. The court could not direct the respondents to withdraw the closure orders and permit the petitioner-Units to run the crushing process. The proper remedy open to the petitioner-Units was to file an appeal before the appropriate authority under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The Writ Petitions were dismissed, and the petitioners were at liberty to file an appeal before the appropriate authority under the said Act.

In summary, the Madras High Court issued a court order regarding six writ petitions filed by various metal companies against the TNPCB and the District Environmental Engineer. The court ordered the inspection of the petitioner-Units to ensure compliance with the Show Cause Notice. The court also stated that the proper remedy open to the petitioner-Units was to file an appeal before the appropriate authority under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The Writ Petitions were dismissed, and the petitioners were at liberty to file an appeal before the appropriate authority under the said Act.
