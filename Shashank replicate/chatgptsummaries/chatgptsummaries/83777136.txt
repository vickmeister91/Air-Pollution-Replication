The Allahabad High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by M/S Shri Krishna Colonisers seeking to quash a notification declaring a certain area in Lucknow as a "fruit belt" under the U.P. Promotion and Protection of Fruit Trees (Regulation of Harmful Establishment Housing Schemes) Act, 1985. The petitioners wanted to develop the land as a high-tech township, but officials informed them that no housing scheme could be permitted within the fruit belt. The court considered the need to protect the ecology and green cover of the area while balancing it with the need for development. The court ultimately upheld the notification, stating that allowing the writ petition would result in the destruction of the green cover and the removal of protection given by the Act, 1985 to the fruit belt.

The court order discusses the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which can only be infringed by a just, fair, and reasonable procedure. The right to a humane and healthy environment has been indirectly approved in various court cases, and the courts have used their innovative power to enforce and safeguard this right. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and balancing development needs with the protection of the environment and ecology. The Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle have been accepted as part of the law of the land, and the court has no hesitation in holding that they are part of the environmental law of the country.

The court order states that rules of Customary International Law that are not against municipal law should be followed by courts. The court also emphasizes the importance of the precautionary principle and the principle of polluter pays in environmental law. The court orders the suspension of licenses for the sale of fireworks in the NCR due to air pollution concerns and directs the CPCB to study the harmful effects of materials used in fireworks. The court also orders the preservation and protection of the "fruit belt" area and directs the state government to take measures to restore the density of fruit trees to a minimum of 20%. The court dismisses the argument that the notification of 1997 was issued without proper regulations and rejects the petition to quash the notification. The state government is directed to preserve and protect the "fruit belt" area and not use it for any purpose other than the preservation of ecology.
