The Karnataka High Court recently rejected a petition filed by Basanagouda S/O Kalagouda Patil, which sought to quash the proceedings in Criminal Case No.1846 of 2016. The case was in connection with private complaint No.9 of 2016 for the offences under Sections 21, 31(A) and Section 37 of AIR AC/1981, which were pending before the II-Additional C.J. (Junior Division) and Judicial Magistrate First Class-II Court, Dharwad.

The petitioner had argued that the case was based on a private complaint, which was filed by a person who had no locus standi to file the complaint. The petitioner also contended that the allegations made in the complaint were false and baseless. The petitioner further argued that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint as the alleged offences had taken place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court.

However, the court rejected all the contentions raised by the petitioner and held that the complaint was maintainable. The court observed that the allegations made in the complaint were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any material to substantiate his claim that the allegations made in the complaint were false and baseless.

The court further held that the question of jurisdiction could not be decided at this stage as it was a mixed question of fact and law, which could only be adjudicated after a thorough investigation. The court also observed that the date of running business and stopping the process of quarrying were all mixed questions of fact and law, which could not be adjudicated in a preliminary stage.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to appear before the trial court and face the charges levelled against him.
