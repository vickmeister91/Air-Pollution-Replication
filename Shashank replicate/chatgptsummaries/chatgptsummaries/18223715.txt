The Delhi Rent Control Act provides for the regulation of rents and eviction of tenants in Delhi. Section 14(1)(e) of the Act allows a landlord to seek possession of a property if they require it for their own use or for the use of any person for whose benefit the property is held. However, a tenant can seek leave to defend such a petition under Section 25(B)(4) of the Act.

In one case, a widow had let out a shop to a tenant on a monthly rent of Rs. 160/-. She filed a petition under Section 14(1)(e) of the Act seeking possession of the shop for her dependent son's tea/eatable shop. The tenant filed an application for leave to defend, challenging the petitioner's requirement and the existence of alternate accommodation.

The court found the respondent's affidavit to be contrived and granted the petitioner's petition. The court held that the petitioner's requirement was bona fide and that the respondent's grounds for defense were untenable. An eviction order was passed against the respondent for the shop in question.

In another case, a landlord filed a petition under Section 14(1)(e) of the Act seeking possession of a shop for her son's tea/eatable shop. The tenant filed an application for leave to defend, which was dismissed by the court. The court found that the petitioner's requirement was bona fide and that the respondent's grounds for defense were untenable. An eviction order was passed against the respondent for the shop in question.

However, the petitioner could not obtain possession for six months from the date of the order. This is because Section 25(B)(8) of the Act provides that if the court passes an order for the recovery of possession of any premises, the tenant shall be entitled to six months' time to vacate the premises.

In both cases, the court upheld the landlord's right to seek possession of the property for their own use or for the use of any person for whose benefit the property is held. The court also found that the tenants' grounds for defense were untenable and that the landlords' requirements were bona fide.

The Delhi Rent Control Act strikes a balance between the rights of landlords and tenants. While landlords have the right to seek possession of their property for their own use or for the use of any person for whose benefit the property is held, tenants have the right to seek leave to defend such petitions and to challenge the landlord's requirement and the existence of alternate accommodation.

In conclusion, the court orders in these cases highlight the importance of a bona fide requirement for seeking possession of a property under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. It also emphasizes the need for tenants to provide genuine grounds for defense and to not resort to contrived affidavits. The Act provides for a fair and just mechanism for the regulation of rents and eviction of tenants, and it is important for both landlords and tenants to understand their rights and obligations under the Act.
