The Gujarat High Court recently heard two writ petitions related to the ban of kite flying in Gujarat and the use of unsafe kite strings, manza, and lanterns during the festival of Uttarayan. The petitioners sought directions to ban kite flying or restrict it on particular days and to ban the use of Chinese manza, nylon strings, and coating of cotton strings with a mixture of crushed glass. The court admitted and expedited the petitions, granting liberty to the counsel for parties to move an application for fixing the date for hearing at a later point of time. The court also issued interim relief by way of directions to address the imminent threat to human lives, environment, and injuries caused to human beings, birds, and animals by using unsafe kite strings, manza, and lanterns.

The court order pertains to a petition seeking a ban on the use of nylon threads and other synthetic threads coated with glass for kite flying during the festival of Uttarayana in Gujarat. The court has directed the state authorities to take steps to prohibit the use of Chinese lanterns and prevent the manufacture, storage, and use of nylon threads and other synthetic threads coated with glass for kite flying. The court has also directed the state authorities to enforce circulars and notifications issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure strictly and create awareness among citizens about the ban. The court has allowed the use of glass-coated manja but banned Chinese manja and Chinese lanterns.

The court has issued an interim order prohibiting the sale of nylon thread, known as Chinese manza or dori, and other synthetic threads coated with harmful substances for kite flying. This order is subject to further orders to be passed by the court at the time of final disposal of the petitions.
