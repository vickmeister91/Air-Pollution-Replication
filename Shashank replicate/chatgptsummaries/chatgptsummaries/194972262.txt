The court orders discussed in this article all pertain to disputes over patents for processes of making low glycemic Indian sweets using various sweeteners. In the first case, the validity and correctness of a patent granted to Krishnamachari Ramu and Lavanya R for a process of making low glycemic sweets using Levulose was challenged by Srinivasa Raja, a partner at Adyar Ananda Bhavan. Raja claimed that the patent lacked novelty, involved no inventive step, and was obvious. The Intellectual Property Appellate Board allowed Raja's application seeking revocation of the patent, stating that the problem addressed by the patent was routine and the solution was not beyond what may be expected from an average person skilled in the art.

In the second case, the court discusses a dispute over a patent for a process of making low glycemic Indian sweets using fructose as a sweetener. The petitioners claim that their process involves preventing the Maillard Reaction/Caramelisation from occurring at high temperatures, resulting in a healthier sweet. The court analyzes the definition of "invention" under The Patents Act, 1970 and ultimately agrees with the third respondent that the process does not involve an inventive step and is not a new product or process. The court revokes the patent granted to the petitioners.

The third case pertains to a patent dispute over a method of making low glycemic Indian sweets using Levulose/Fructose/Fruit Sugar at elevated temperatures. The petitioners claim that their invention is new and addresses the needs of people with diabetes, including children with juvenile diabetes. The second respondent had granted a patent in favor of the petitioners, but it was revoked by the third respondent. The court found that there was no scientific proof to show that the process invented by the petitioners resulted in the elimination of browning occurring in the traditional method of making sweets. The matter was remanded back to the third respondent with a direction to consider the application filed by the first respondent for revocation of the patents granted in favor of the petitioners afresh.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of novelty and inventive step in the patenting process. The court in the first case found that the solution presented in the patent was not beyond what an average person skilled in the art could come up with, while the court in the second case found that the process did not involve an inventive step. In the third case, the court found that there was no scientific proof to support the claims made by the petitioners. These cases serve as a reminder that patents should only be granted for truly novel and inventive ideas, and that scientific evidence is crucial in supporting such claims.
