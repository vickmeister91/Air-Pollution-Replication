The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Sh. Krishan Mohan against Sh. Niranjan Lal for non-payment of rent and bonafide need of the tenanted premises. The petitioner is the owner of the property, and the respondent is running a grocery shop from the tenanted premises. The petitioner claims that the respondent is in arrears of rent and has not paid despite a demand notice. The respondent disputes the rate of rent and claims to have paid regularly.

After hearing both parties, the court finds that the rate of rent is Rs. 350/- per month, and the respondent was in arrears of rent from January 2008. The court directs the respondent to deposit the rent within a month. The petitioner also claims bonafide need of the tenanted premises for running his own business. The respondent disputes the bonafide need.

The court finds that the petitioner has a right to have his independent income and not depend on his children's income. The court orders eviction of the respondent from the tenanted premises. The court also notes that the nature of business the petitioner may do from the suit shop would depend on his resources and funds available to him.

In another court order, the court grants an eviction order in favor of the petitioner for a shop that he needs for his bonafide requirement. The petitioner is a pensioner with no other source of income and has no alternative accommodation to do business. The court notes that the pension may not be sufficient to meet his household expenses and that non-disclosure of the income of his children does not turn the need of the suit shop into malafide.

The court also states that the nature of business the petitioner may do from the suit shop would depend on his resources and funds available to him. The order is not executable prior to six months from the date of the order.

In both cases, the court has considered the bonafide need of the petitioner and has granted eviction orders in their favor. In the first case, the petitioner is the owner of the property and has a right to have his independent income. In the second case, the petitioner is a pensioner with no other source of income and has no alternative accommodation to do business.

The court has also considered the nature of business the petitioner may do from the suit shop and has stated that it would depend on his resources and funds available to him. The court has given the respondent a month to deposit the rent in the first case and has made the eviction order executable after six months in the second case.

Overall, the court has made decisions based on the facts presented by both parties and has considered the bonafide need of the petitioner in both cases. The court has also taken into account the financial situation of the petitioner and has made orders that are fair and just.
