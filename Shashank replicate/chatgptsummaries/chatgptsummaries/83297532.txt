The Income Tax Department recently filed a petition challenging an order in a criminal case related to tax evasion. During the investigation, the department seized a car believed to have been purchased in violation of the Income Tax Act. The owner of the car filed a complaint with the police alleging that a broker had cheated him and sold the car to the tax evader. The police filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain the car from the Income Tax Department, but the court set aside the order, stating that the car was not essential evidence and that the owner should seek interim custody from the Income Tax Department.

The case revolves around the seizure of a car by the Income Tax Department during an investigation into tax evasion. The department believed that the car had been purchased in violation of the Income Tax Act and seized it as part of their investigation. However, the owner of the car filed a complaint with the police, alleging that a broker had cheated him and sold the car to the tax evader. The police then filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain the car from the Income Tax Department.

The court, however, set aside the order, stating that the car was not essential evidence in the case. The court also directed the owner of the car to seek interim custody from the Income Tax Department. This decision by the court has significant implications for both the Income Tax Department and the police.

For the Income Tax Department, this decision means that they may not be able to rely on the seizure of assets as evidence in cases related to tax evasion. This could make it more difficult for the department to build cases against tax evaders and could lead to a decrease in the number of successful prosecutions.

For the police, this decision means that they may not be able to rely on Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain assets that they believe are connected to criminal activity. This could make it more difficult for the police to investigate and prosecute cases related to financial crimes.

Overall, this decision by the court highlights the importance of evidence in criminal cases and the need for law enforcement agencies to carefully consider the evidence they rely on when building cases. It also highlights the need for clear guidelines and procedures for the seizure of assets in cases related to financial crimes.
