The court order in question pertains to two criminal revision applications filed by three accused persons who were convicted by a trial court for the offence punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. The judgment was challenged before the Sessions Judge, who dismissed the appeals and confirmed the trial court's judgment. The accused then filed the present revision.

The court, in its order, upheld the conviction of the accused but modified the sentence to the period already undergone by them. The court considered the young age of the accused and the time spent contesting the case while modifying the sentence. The order is significant as it highlights the importance of considering the circumstances of the accused while deciding the sentence.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial legislation aimed at protecting wildlife in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. Section 51 of the Act deals with the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary, national park, or reserve forest. The section provides for imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, which may extend to seven years, and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.
