The court orders discussed in this summary involve disputes over land ownership and building permits in the Idukki district of Kerala, India. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Luke Stephen, who sought to quash communications from the Pallivasal Grama Panchayat and the District Collector directing him to show cause why his building permit and D&O license should not be cancelled. Stephen argued that since the building was already completed and operational, it was unjust and arbitrary to propose cancellation of the permit and license. The court heard the case and delivered a judgment on February 27, 2019.

The second court order discusses a dispute over the assignment of 10,000 acres of land outside the Cardamom Hill Reserve. The petitioner claims to have purchased the land from the assignees of Padannamackal Chacko, but the 5th respondent refutes this claim, stating that no proper procedures were followed by the government in assigning the land. The respondent also argues that the land is reserved forest land and covered by the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and therefore cannot be used for non-forest activities like construction. The respondent further claims that the petitioner has no valid title to the property and has illegally created documents to grab government property. The court order also mentions a fabricated document and a detailed counter affidavit filed by the respondent.

The third court order states that the land given for cardamom cultivation cannot be transferred without permission from the government and that documents were fabricated to grab government land. The petitioner did not obtain permission from revenue officials to construct buildings and conduct business on the property, which violates an interim court order. The petitioner did not have valid documents to establish title over the property. The issue at hand is whether interference should be made in a notice issued by the Secretary of the Grama Panchayat, directing the petitioner to produce a D&O license and building permit, since they are to be cancelled. The notice was issued based on directives from the District Collector, who stated that the buildings were constructed on land given for cardamom cultivation and therefore the permit and clearances cannot be sustained. The Secretary of the Grama Panchayat has no option but to cancel the permit and license.

The fourth court order discusses a dispute over a building permit issued by the Secretary of the Grama Panchayat. The petitioner claims to have purchased the property legally and obtained all necessary permits and clearances. However, the District Collector issued a notice to cancel the building permit and D&O license, which the Secretary of the Grama Panchayat had to comply with. The court finds that the District Collector's direction was illegal and arbitrary, as the power to revoke permits is only vested with the Secretary under Rule 18 of the Rules, 2011. The court also notes that the dispute is subject to ongoing criminal proceedings and refrains from relying on certain documents until the proceedings are finalized.

The fifth court order states that the Secretary has the power to stay, suspend, or revoke any permit issued if there is a violation of conditions or laws, or if the construction poses a threat to life or property. The District Collector cannot dictate terms to the Secretary and cancel permits without proper authority. The petitioner is allowed to continue their activities subject to any investigation or orders passed by competent authorities. The court emphasizes that authorities should be guided by law, reasons, and patience, rather than passion and abrupt actions. The writ petition is allowed to the extent mentioned. The order includes several exhibits, such as land tax receipts, building permits, and certificates issued by authorities.

The final court order includes a list of exhibits, which are true copies of various certificates, licenses, approvals, and other documents related to a resort. The exhibits include photographs of the resort's current condition, proceedings of government officials, and replies submitted by the petitioner. The order also includes a true copy of an interim order passed by the court in a previous case.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary permissions and clearances before constructing buildings or conducting business on government land. They also emphasize the need for authorities to act in accordance with the law and avoid arbitrary actions. The disputes discussed in these orders are subject to ongoing criminal proceedings, indicating the seriousness of the allegations made by the parties involved.
