Two court orders have been issued in cases related to the possession of animal skins without a valid license. The first case was filed by the Wildlife Inspector against Sodhi Freight Carriers, and the second case was filed under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Both cases involve the possession of animal skins without a valid license, and both cases have resulted in the framing of charges against the accused.

In the first case, the accused argued that the manager who was present during the raid had no knowledge of the articles and cannot be charged. However, the court held that the accused was in charge of the business and responsible for the conduct of the company, and therefore, liable to be proceeded against. The court also noted that the accused did not exercise due care when accepting the consignment for transportation, and therefore, a prima facie case against the accused has been made out. The court ordered the framing of charges against the accused.

In the second case, the accused was found in possession of a large number of animal skins without a license. The court found that the recovery of the skins indicated that they were meant for business and nothing else. The accused was charged under various sections of the Act, and the burden of proof was on them to show that they took due care. The court ordered that charges be framed and formal charges dictated separately.

The possession of animal skins without a valid license is a serious offense under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trade of wildlife. The possession of animal skins without a valid license is a violation of the Act and can result in imprisonment and fines.

In both cases, the accused were found to be in possession of animal skins without a valid license. The court held that the accused were responsible for the conduct of their businesses and did not exercise due care when accepting the consignments for transportation. The court ordered the framing of charges against the accused, indicating that a prima facie case had been made out against them.

The Act provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats and prohibits the trade of wildlife and their products. The possession of animal skins without a valid license is a violation of the Act and can result in imprisonment and fines.
