The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Mr. Ami Chand against the State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) and G.E. Capitals Ltd. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate-06, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi, in a complaint case. The petitioner's defense was that his signatures had been forged on cheques and loan documents, and he sought to call for original documents for comparison with his specimen signatures. The trial court rejected his application under section 91 Cr.PC, but the court of Sh. Sidharth Sharma allowed the petition, stating that the accused had a valuable right to bring on record that his signatures were forged.

The court order allows the defense to present evidence to prove their innocence, specifically through a comparison report from the FSL. If the report shows that the accused did not sign the cheques and documents in question, the case can be decided immediately. However, if the report goes against the accused, the trial court can use it to convict them. The order sets aside a previous decision and allows the accused to request FSL examination of the records. The trial court is directed to comply with this request.
