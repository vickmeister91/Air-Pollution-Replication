The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court recently set aside an order passed by the Court below, which had dismissed a petition filed by C. Neelaveni under Section 91(2) Cr.P.C. Neelaveni had filed a petition seeking a direction to the employer of S. Arun @ Ramasubramanian to produce certain documents relating to his monthly salary. The Court below had found that the respondent had accepted the employment and had also given the salary particulars, and therefore there was no requirement to call for the salary particulars from the employer of the respondent.

However, the High Court disagreed with the lower court's decision and directed it to send for the documents relating to the monthly salary of the respondent from his employer. The High Court also ordered the lower court to complete the proceedings within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

The case highlights the importance of Section 91(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This provision is often used by courts to obtain evidence that is crucial to the determination of a case.

In this case, Neelaveni had sought the production of certain documents relating to the monthly salary of the respondent, which she believed were necessary for the proper determination of the case. The lower court had rejected her petition on the grounds that the respondent had already provided the salary particulars and there was no need to call for the documents from the employer.

However, the High Court found that the lower court had erred in its decision and that the documents sought by Neelaveni were indeed necessary for the proper determination of the case. The High Court noted that the respondent had only provided the salary particulars and had not produced any documentary evidence to support his claims. Therefore, it was necessary to call for the documents from the employer to verify the respondent's claims.

The High Court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of Section 91(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in ensuring that courts have access to all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of a case. The provision is a powerful tool that enables courts to obtain evidence that may not be readily available to the parties involved in the case.

The case also highlights the need for parties to provide all the necessary evidence to support their claims. In this case, the respondent had only provided the salary particulars and had not produced any documentary evidence to support his claims. This had led to the lower court's decision to reject Neelaveni's petition. However, the High Court's decision shows that parties must provide all the necessary evidence to support their claims, and that mere assertions or statements may not be sufficient.

In conclusion, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court's decision to set aside the lower court's order and direct it to send for the documents relating to the monthly salary of the respondent from his employer is a significant one. It reaffirms the importance of Section 91(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in ensuring that courts have access to all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of a case. The case also highlights the need for parties to provide all the necessary evidence to support their claims, and that mere assertions or statements may not be sufficient.
