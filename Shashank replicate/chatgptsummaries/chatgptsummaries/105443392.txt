In the case of Sanjay, a petition for anticipatory bail was filed in response to FIR No. 109/2018, which was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Environment Protection Act, and the Mining Act. The petitioner had joined the investigation following an interim direction granted on August 10, 2018. The State of Haryana did not dispute this fact, and the interim order was made absolute. The case was ultimately disposed of on October 17, 2018.

The filing of a petition for anticipatory bail is a common legal strategy in India, particularly in cases where the accused party fears arrest. In this case, Sanjay was seeking protection from arrest in connection with the aforementioned FIR. The FIR itself was registered under several different laws, indicating that the alleged offense was multifaceted in nature.

The fact that Sanjay joined the investigation following an interim direction suggests that he was cooperating with law enforcement officials. This may have been a factor in the court's decision to grant the interim order and ultimately dispose of the case. It is unclear from the available information what specific allegations were made against Sanjay in the FIR, or whether he was ultimately charged with any crimes.

The fact that the State of Haryana did not dispute Sanjay's compliance with the interim direction is notable. It suggests that there was no reason to believe that Sanjay was attempting to evade the investigation or obstruct justice in any way. This may have been a factor in the court's decision to make the interim order absolute and ultimately dispose of the case.

Overall, the case of Sanjay highlights the importance of legal representation in India's criminal justice system. By filing a petition for anticipatory bail, Sanjay was able to protect himself from potential arrest and ensure that he had the opportunity to cooperate with law enforcement officials. The fact that the case was ultimately disposed of suggests that Sanjay was able to successfully navigate the legal system and avoid any serious consequences.
