The court order in question pertains to a Special Criminal Application (Quashing) filed by Sangitaben Kiritbhai Khant and two others against Kiritbhai Jayantibhai Khant and another person. The applicants' advocate argued that the lower courts had erred in not considering the true implication of invoking powers under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also allows the court to direct any person in possession of such document or thing to produce it before the court.

The applicants' argument was that the lower courts had failed to consider the true implication of invoking powers under section 91. They contended that the lower courts had not taken into account the fact that the power under section 91 is discretionary and should be exercised sparingly. The applicants also argued that the lower courts had not considered the fact that the power under section 91 should not be used as a substitute for the power of investigation.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the applicants' advocate, issued notice returnable on 18.3.2016 and permitted direct service to be made to the respondent. This means that the respondent will be served notice of the court order directly, rather than through the usual process of service.

The court's decision to issue notice returnable on 18.3.2016 indicates that the court will hear the matter on that date. The court's decision to permit direct service to be made to the respondent is significant because it suggests that the court is taking the matter seriously and wants to ensure that the respondent is aware of the court order.

Overall, the court order in question relates to a dispute between the applicants and the respondent regarding the invocation of powers under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The applicants have argued that the lower courts erred in not considering the true implication of invoking these powers, and the court has issued notice returnable on 18.3.2016 and permitted direct service to be made to the respondent. It remains to be seen how the matter will be resolved, but the court's decision to hear the matter and permit direct service suggests that it is taking the dispute seriously.
