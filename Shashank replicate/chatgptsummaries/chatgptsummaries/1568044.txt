The court order in question pertains to a dispute between Ramji Dass and Bhupinder Singh and others. The case involves an ex parte order passed against Ramji Dass by the Tribunal under the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act. Ramji Dass had applied to set aside the ex parte order, but the Tribunal declined to do so. Ramji Dass appealed to the High Court, but the appeal was dismissed. 

The court found that the Tribunal had failed to appreciate the real point in controversy, which was whether due service of summons had been proved. The court held that the Tribunal had erred in assuming that an ex parte order passed at one hearing would hold good for the entire future course of the proceedings. The court also found that the learned Single Judge had erred in upholding the Tribunal's order.

The court order states that a previous order was not operative and the tribunal had the duty to consider afresh whether or not to hold proceedings in the absence of Mahant Ramji Das. The tribunal was wrong to proceed ex parte against Mahant Ramji Das without due service and the ex parte proceedings and decree were set aside. The case was remitted back to the tribunal for further proceedings. The parties were directed to appear in the tribunal on a given date and costs incurred so far would be costs in the cause. The appeal was allowed.
