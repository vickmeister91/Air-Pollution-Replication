The court order pertains to an appeal filed by Harish Chadha against a judgment of conviction and order on sentence for an offense punishable under Section 276 (C) (2) of the Income Tax Act. The complaint against Chadha was that he did not file any return for the year 1995-96 despite earning a profit of Rs. 4,05,81,265/- in the export business. Notices were issued to him, and he filed the return in 2001, but he did not deposit the tax, penalty, and interest willfully. The court found him guilty of willfully attempting to evade payment of tax and sentenced him to two years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lac.

In another case, an individual was convicted of willfully attempting to evade payment of tax, penalty, or interest under the Income Tax Act. The defense argued that the individual's financial inability to pay the dues meant that the evasion was not willful. However, the court pointed out that a statutory provision (Section 278 E) presumes the existence of a culpable mental state in such cases, and it is up to the accused to disprove it. The court also noted that the defense relied on legal precedents that were prior to the incorporation of Section 278 E. The court ultimately upheld the conviction, finding that the accused had failed to disprove the existence of a culpable mental state.

The court order upholds the conviction of Harish Chadha for tax evasion and states that his claimed financial transactions with his co-brother are disputed and not covered under the Income Tax Act. The court also notes that Chadha's financial means are not as he claimed and that tax evasion is a serious offense that deserves stern punishment. The court upholds the sentence of 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh.

The court has maintained the sentence of 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh for the offense committed. The appeal has been disposed of, and the file will be consigned to RR. The TCR will be sent back with a copy of the order. The judgment was announced and dictated in open court on 09.08.12.

In summary, the court order pertains to the conviction of Harish Chadha for tax evasion under Section 276 (C) (2) of the Income Tax Act. The court found him guilty of willfully attempting to evade payment of tax and sentenced him to two years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lac. The court also upheld the conviction of another individual for willful tax evasion, noting that a statutory provision presumes the existence of a culpable mental state in such cases. The court emphasized that tax evasion is a serious offense that deserves stern punishment. The sentence of 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh was maintained in both cases. The appeal has been disposed of, and the file will be consigned to RR.
