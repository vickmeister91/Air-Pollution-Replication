The Bombay High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by an NGO, Abhivyakti, regarding a 6-hectare land in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. The NGO claimed that the land was a water body connected to the main Panvel Creek and should be declared a wetland and protected. The land in question is owned by City Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited (CIDCO), which denies the existence of a pond and claims that the land is jirayat, meaning water accumulates only during monsoon.

The court noted that the PIL lacked factual basis and was motivated. The court found that satellite imaging showed no water body on the land in question and that the PIL was motivated to stall development in Navi Mumbai. The court found the PIL to be frivolous and imposed a cost of â‚¹1,00,000 on the petitioner, to be paid to the High Court Legal Aid Fund within two weeks.

The court order has brought to light the issue of wetlands and their protection. Wetlands are areas where water is the primary factor controlling the environment and the associated plant and animal life. Wetlands are important for biodiversity, water storage, and flood control. They also provide ecosystem services such as water purification, carbon sequestration, and recreation.

Wetlands are under threat due to human activities such as land reclamation, drainage, and pollution. The loss of wetlands has serious consequences for the environment and human well-being. Wetlands are protected under the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.

In India, wetlands are protected under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The rules define wetlands as "areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters."

The rules require the identification and notification of wetlands, the preparation of a list of wetlands, and the preparation of a comprehensive management plan for each wetland. The rules also prohibit activities such as reclamation, conversion, and dumping of waste in wetlands.

The court order in the Kharghar case highlights the importance of factual basis and motivation in PILs. PILs are a powerful tool for public interest litigation, but they must be based on facts and not motivated by personal interests. PILs must serve the larger public interest and not be used to stall development or harass individuals or organizations.

The court order also highlights the need for the protection of wetlands. Wetlands are important for the environment and human well-being, and their loss has serious consequences. The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, provide a framework for the protection and management of wetlands, but their implementation needs to be strengthened.

In conclusion, the court order in the Kharghar case brings to light the issue of wetlands and their protection. Wetlands are important for biodiversity, water storage, and flood control, and their loss has serious consequences. The court order also highlights the importance of factual basis and motivation in PILs. PILs must serve the larger public interest and not be used to stall development or harass individuals or organizations. The implementation of the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, needs to be strengthened to protect wetlands effectively.
