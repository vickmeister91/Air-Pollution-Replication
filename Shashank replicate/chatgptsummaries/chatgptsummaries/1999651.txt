The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by the Divisional Forest Officers against a mining lease granted to S. Nageswaramma in a forest area. The lease had expired, and an application for renewal was made without obtaining prior approval from the Central Government, which was a violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Forest Department canceled the lease, and the respondent filed a writ in the High Court.

The High Court directed the respondent to extract the stacked material subject to obtaining prior approval from competent authorities. However, the court found the direction issued by the High Court to be illegal and allowed the appeal without costs.

The case revolves around the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which was enacted to protect forests and wildlife in India. The act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes must be approved by the Central Government. In this case, the mining lease granted to S. Nageswaramma was in violation of this act as the renewal application was made without obtaining prior approval from the Central Government.

The Forest Department canceled the lease, and the respondent filed a writ in the High Court challenging the cancellation. The High Court directed the respondent to extract the stacked material subject to obtaining prior approval from competent authorities. However, the court found this direction to be illegal as it went against the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court's decision to allow the appeal without costs means that the cancellation of the mining lease will stand, and the respondent will not be able to extract any material from the forest area without obtaining prior approval from the Central Government. This decision upholds the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and ensures that forest land is protected from unauthorized use.

The case highlights the importance of following the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. Failure to do so can result in the cancellation of leases and legal action, as seen in this case.

In conclusion, the court order in this case upholds the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and ensures that forest land is protected from unauthorized use. The decision to cancel the mining lease and disallow the extraction of stacked material without prior approval from the Central Government sends a strong message about the importance of following the law and obtaining necessary approvals before any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes.
