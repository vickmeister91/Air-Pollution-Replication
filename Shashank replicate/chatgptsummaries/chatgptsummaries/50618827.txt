In a recent court order, the judge has granted a one-week extension for the filing of an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner has requested this application, and the respondent has filed a reply. The court has ordered that both parties must submit their respective documents within the next week.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows the court to issue an order for the production of any document or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This section is often used in criminal cases to obtain evidence that may be crucial to the case.

The court has not provided any details about the case in question, but it is likely that the application under Section 91 is related to the ongoing proceedings. The judge has ordered that the case will be listed again after the one-week extension has expired.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant an extension for the filing of the application and reply indicates that the judge is taking a careful and considered approach to the case. This is a positive sign for both parties, as it suggests that the judge is committed to ensuring that all relevant evidence is considered before making a decision.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures in criminal cases. By allowing both parties to submit their documents within a set timeframe, the court is ensuring that the case is handled fairly and transparently. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the case will be, but this order suggests that the judge is committed to upholding the principles of justice and due process.
