The National Green Tribunal in Pune recently heard a case brought by Shivaji Suryabhan Sangle against the Union of India, the State of Maharashtra, and others regarding the laying of a metallic pipeline through the Maldhok sanctuary, which is home to the Great Indian Bustard, a protected species of bird. The petitioner sought a mandatory injunction against the Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Limited to stop the work of laying down the underground pipeline in the protected sanctuary of Taluka Karjat and other forest lands within Karjat and Shrigonda Talukas of Ahmednagar District. Respondents denied that the pipeline passed through any part of the forest area of the sanctuary.

The court order pertains to an application filed by a petitioner against Respondent No.7, who had laid an underground pipeline in the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary. The Respondent argued that they had obtained permission from the Supreme Court and had paid a compensatory amount, and that the pipeline was covered by surface vegetation and would not cause any damage to the environment. The court considered whether the pipeline required forest clearance, whether there was a private forest in the area, and whether the project was illegal. The court found that the National Green Tribunal Act did not cover the implementation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and that the Respondent had obtained permission from the Supreme Court. The court also noted that the Respondent had felled trees without permission and had been penalized for it. The court dismissed the petition and directed the Collector to verify whether the penalty had been paid and to recover it if necessary.
