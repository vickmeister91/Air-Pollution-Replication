The court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner is seeking a "No Objection Certificate" (NOC) under section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court has directed respondent no.4 to consider the request of the State on the basis of the previous proposal without insisting on a fresh proposal and take an appropriate decision in accordance with the law. The case has been listed again for September 4, 2015.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. Under the Act, any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes requires the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Board for Wildlife to advise the Central Government on matters relating to the conservation of wildlife.

In the present case, the petitioner is seeking an NOC for the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The petitioner has submitted a proposal to the State Government for the diversion of forest land, which has been forwarded to respondent no.4 for consideration. However, respondent no.4 has not taken any decision on the proposal, and the petitioner has approached the court seeking a direction to respondent no.4 to consider the proposal and take an appropriate decision in accordance with the law.

The court has directed respondent no.4 to consider the request of the State on the basis of the previous proposal without insisting on a fresh proposal. This means that respondent no.4 cannot ask the petitioner to submit a fresh proposal and must consider the proposal that has already been submitted. The court has also directed respondent no.4 to take an appropriate decision in accordance with the law. This means that respondent no.4 must consider the proposal in light of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and any other relevant laws and regulations.

The court's direction is significant because it ensures that the petitioner's proposal will be considered on its merits and in accordance with the law. It also ensures that respondent no.4 cannot delay the decision-making process by insisting on a fresh proposal. The court's direction is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that decisions be made fairly and without undue delay.

The case has been listed again for September 4, 2015. This means that the court will review the progress of the case on that date and may issue further directions if necessary. The listing of the case for a future date is a common practice in legal proceedings and allows the court to monitor the progress of the case and ensure that all parties are complying with its directions.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner is seeking an NOC for the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court has directed respondent no.4 to consider the request of the State on the basis of the previous proposal without insisting on a fresh proposal and take an appropriate decision in accordance with the law. The case has been listed again for September 4, 2015.
