In the case of GHCL vs State, the court heard arguments from both sides on September 2, 2008. The main issue at hand was whether the company had breached a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forests in 2006. The court found that the allegations in the complaint were for breach of this notification and that the company may have also violated the Air Act and Water Act.

The court issued a rule returnable on November 12, 2008, and granted interim relief for further proceedings of Criminal case No. 1242 of 2007. This meant that the case would be heard again on November 12, 2008, and that the company would be granted temporary relief until then. However, the respondent was not precluded from taking action in accordance with the law for any breach by the applicant under provisions of any other Act.

The case of GHCL vs State was a significant one, as it dealt with issues related to environmental regulations and the responsibilities of companies in ensuring compliance with these regulations. The Ministry of Environment & Forests had issued a notification in 2006, which the company was alleged to have breached. The court found that the allegations were indeed for breach of this notification, and that the company may have also violated the Air Act and Water Act.

The court's decision to issue a rule returnable on November 12, 2008, was an important one, as it allowed for further proceedings in the case. The interim relief granted to the company meant that it would not face any immediate consequences for its alleged breaches, but the respondent was not precluded from taking action in accordance with the law for any breach by the applicant under provisions of any other Act.

Overall, the case of GHCL vs State highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need for companies to ensure compliance with these regulations. The court's decision to issue a rule returnable on November 12, 2008, and grant interim relief for further proceedings of Criminal case No. 1242 of 2007, demonstrates the seriousness with which such breaches are taken and the need for companies to take their responsibilities in this regard seriously.
