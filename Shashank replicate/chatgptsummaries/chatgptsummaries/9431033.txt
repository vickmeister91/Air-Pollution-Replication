The court order pertains to two cases involving disputes over land in Vengambur Village, Erode District. In the first case, B.R. Viswanathan filed a writ petition to prevent the District Forest Officer from interfering with his possession and enjoyment of the land. The Forest Department claimed that the land had been declared a reserve forest and could not be leased out without their concurrence. The court found that Viswanathan had no vested right over the land and that the Public Works Department had no authority to collect lease rents for the land. The court also noted allegations of tampering of records and illegal actions by the Tahsildar, Erode.

In the second case, a petitioner had filed a criminal petition against forest officials, and the court had directed the Deputy Superintendent of Police to conduct an inquiry into the matter.

The court found that the petitioner was trying to take advantage of a dispute between two departments and that no relief could be granted to the petitioner. The review application was allowed, and the writ petition was dismissed.
