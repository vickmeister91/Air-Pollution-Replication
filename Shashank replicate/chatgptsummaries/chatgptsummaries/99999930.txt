The State of Rajasthan recently challenged a court order that allowed Nawab Ali to use 5 Bighas of land as a burial ground for Kayamkhani Muslims and construct a boundary wall around it. The State argued that the construction of a boundary wall by a private person is a 'non-forest activity' and requires prior approval of the Central Government under The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003. The court modified the judgment and decree, stating that the construction of the boundary wall would be subject to the prior permission of the Central Government.

The case was heard in the Rajasthan High Court, where the State of Rajasthan challenged the order that allowed Nawab Ali to use the land as a burial ground and construct a boundary wall around it. The State argued that the construction of a boundary wall by a private person is a 'non-forest activity' and requires prior approval of the Central Government under The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003. The State contended that the land in question was a forest land and that the construction of the boundary wall would have an adverse impact on the environment.

The court, however, modified the judgment and decree, stating that the construction of the boundary wall would be subject to the prior permission of the Central Government. The respondent, Nawab Ali, was allowed to apply for approval under Rule 6 of The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003, and the concerned authority was directed to decide on the application within three months.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act provides for the establishment of a Central Government authority to oversee the conservation of forests and the management of forest lands. The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003, were framed under the Act to regulate the diversion of forest lands for non-forest purposes.

The court's decision to modify the judgment and decree was based on the provisions of The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003. The court held that the construction of the boundary wall by a private person on forest land is a 'non-forest activity' and requires prior approval of the Central Government. The court also held that the land in question was a forest land and that the construction of the boundary wall would have an adverse impact on the environment.

The court's decision to allow Nawab Ali to apply for approval under Rule 6 of The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003, was based on the fact that the concerned authority was directed to decide on the application within three months. The court's decision was aimed at ensuring that the construction of the boundary wall would not have an adverse impact on the environment and that the conservation of forests would be upheld.

In conclusion, the court's decision to modify the judgment and decree in the case of the State of Rajasthan v. Nawab Ali was based on the provisions of The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003. The court held that the construction of the boundary wall by a private person on forest land is a 'non-forest activity' and requires prior approval of the Central Government. The court's decision to allow Nawab Ali to apply for approval under Rule 6 of The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003, was aimed at ensuring that the construction of the boundary wall would not have an adverse impact on the environment and that the conservation of forests would be upheld.
