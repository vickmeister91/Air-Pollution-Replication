The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Ajay Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a previous writ petition filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The court issued several directions to the state and pollution control board to inspect the canals, remove inlets discharging filthy substances, and prepare short and long-term schemes to prevent untreated effluent discharge into the canal. The court also directed the state to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The case was adjourned to a later date.

The court has ordered the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them to ensure they are free of contamination. The state has been directed to come up with short and long-term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination in a given timeframe. The court has also directed the state to impose damages or compensation on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through public notices. The court has deferred imposing a cost on the state for failing to comply with previous orders but has warned that it will be imposed if the state does not submit the required reports and plans. The court has also ordered the District Collector to be present with relevant records on the next hearing date.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered the State Government to comply with the directions in letter and spirit.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of water bodies in Rajasthan. The court orders the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over civil cases related to environmental protection. The court cites the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but notes that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued if an inferior court or tribunal has committed a patent error that cannot be cured by other remedies.

The court order states that a petitioner cannot approach a writ court without exhausting all other remedies, unless the inferior court or tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. In this case, the original applicant's cause is within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and the tribunal has the power to condone any delay in filing the application. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed, but the petitioner is allowed to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by December 31, 2016, and the state authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until then. The NGT has the power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations sympathetically. After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT.
