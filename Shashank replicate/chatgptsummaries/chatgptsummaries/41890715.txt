The court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Smt. Sunita Motwani and her minor son, Karthickeya, challenging the judgment passed by the LIX Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City, in Crl. Appeal No.419/2018. The petitioners sought an alternative accommodation or monthly rent of Rs.19,000/- from the respondent, Amitabh Sinha, who is the husband of Smt. Sunita Motwani. The court examined Section 19 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which provides for a woman's right to reside in an alternative residence or secure the same level of living standard as enjoyed in the shared household. The court allowed the petitioners to file a fresh application before the learned Magistrate.

The court order states that the petitioner and her son are residing in a rented house and are entitled to secure some standard of living in which they have shared the residential house. The respondent filed an objection but did not deny the fact. The court has the power to pass an order for alternative residence sought against the husband or accommodation to the victim of domestic violence. The right of residence which a wife has does not mean the right to reside in a particular property. The court has to award rental and other accommodation as per Section 19 of the Act.

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, was enacted to provide for more effective protection of the rights of women who are victims of domestic violence. The Act recognizes that domestic violence is a violation of the fundamental rights of women and that it is the responsibility of the State to protect women from such violence. The Act defines domestic violence as any act of violence, including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse, committed by a person against a woman who is or has been in a domestic relationship with that person.

The Act provides for a woman's right to reside in an alternative residence or secure the same level of living standard as enjoyed in the shared household. The Act recognizes that women who are victims of domestic violence may not be able to continue to reside in the shared household due to the violence they have suffered. In such cases, the Act provides for the woman's right to reside in an alternative residence or secure the same level of living standard as enjoyed in the shared household.

The court order in this case recognizes the right of the petitioner and her son to secure some standard of living in which they have shared the residential house. The court has the power to pass an order for alternative residence sought against the husband or accommodation to the victim of domestic violence. The right of residence which a wife has does not mean the right to reside in a particular property. The court has to award rental and other accommodation as per Section 19 of the Act.

The court order allows the petitioners to file a fresh application before the learned Magistrate. The Magistrate will then examine the application and pass an appropriate order in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for a range of remedies that can be granted to a woman who is a victim of domestic violence, including protection orders, residence orders, monetary relief, custody orders, and compensation orders.

The court order also sets aside the impugned judgment passed by LIX Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bangalore City (CCH-60) in Crl. Appeal No.419/2018 dated 21.07.218 by confirming the order of the Court below. The First Appellate Court had set aside the impugned order passed in Crl. Misc.No.3380/2017 dated 28.12.2017 only on the ground that an enquiry has to be held in this behalf.

In conclusion, the court order in this case recognizes the right of the petitioner and her son to secure some standard of living in which they have shared the residential house. The court has the power to pass an order for alternative residence sought against the husband or accommodation to the victim of domestic violence. The right of residence which a wife has does not mean the right to reside in a particular property. The court has to award rental and other accommodation as per Section 19 of the Act. The order allows the petitioners to file a fresh application before the learned Magistrate, who will then examine the application and pass an appropriate order in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
