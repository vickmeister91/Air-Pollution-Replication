The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab, Chandigarh issued an order in response to a consumer complaint filed by Sheenu against M/S Marvel Homes Construction Private Limited and its director, Vinod Kumar, as well as the Municipal Corporation of Ludhiana. Sheenu alleged that the defendants did not provide the amenities promised in their brochure and sale deed for the Motia Marvel Homes project, and sought legal possession of her flat, compensation for mental agony, and payment of interest on the amounts paid. The Commission found that the defendants had violated various regulations and ordered them to provide the promised amenities, obtain necessary permissions and certificates, and pay compensation and interest.

In another court order, the complainant was awarded Rs. 2 lakhs in litigation expenses and directed the opposite parties to pay Rs. 1 lakh to the complainant, along with interest, for maintenance charges obtained from her. The court also ordered any other relief to be passed in favor of the complainant and against the opposite parties, and awarded the cost of the complaint in favor of the complainant. The court heard evidence from both parties and dismissed the objection that the complainant is not a consumer.

The court order stated that the complainant is a consumer and not a commercial buyer, as she had booked a flat to look after her parents. The court also ruled that the complaint is not barred by limitation and that Marvel Home Society is not a necessary party. The court also discussed the issue of facilities/amenities promised in the brochure and stated that the Ops are under legal obligation to provide them. The court referred to various judgments to support its ruling.

The court order referenced several judgments related to the obligation of builders and developers to provide necessary facilities and amenities as advertised in brochures and prospectuses. The order noted that failure to provide such facilities constitutes a deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. The order also discussed specific deficiencies in the case at hand, including the installation of lifts that do not meet the advertised specifications and the lack of open space. The court ultimately found the builder liable for these deficiencies and ordered compensation to be paid to the complainant.

In another court order, various complaints made by a complainant against a developer regarding the construction of a residential complex were discussed. The court found that the developer had fulfilled some promises made in the brochure, such as the provision of a swimming pool and a club house, while some promises were not made in the brochure, such as the provision of a fountain and glass cover. The court also found that the developer had obtained necessary approvals and certificates, and the maintenance of common spaces is the responsibility of the society formed by the residents. The court dismissed some complaints due to lack of evidence or agreement, while some complaints were partially granted.

The court order stated that the Ops (developers) are required to obtain a completion/occupation certificate as per the PAPRA or Municipal Corporation Act, 1976. The court also directed the Ops to complete the swimming pool, provide two car parkings, and pay compensation for installing lifts without automatic rescue device system. The Ops were also directed to pay compensation for mental agony and harassment, and litigation expenses. The order must be complied with within two days, or the complainant can file an application under Sections 25 & 27 of the CP Act against the Ops.

In summary, these court orders all relate to consumer complaints against builders and developers for failing to provide promised amenities and facilities in their projects. The courts have consistently ruled in favor of the complainants, finding the builders and developers liable for deficiencies in service and unfair trade practices. The courts have ordered compensation to be paid to the complainants, along with interest and litigation expenses. The courts have also directed the builders and developers to obtain necessary approvals and certificates, complete promised facilities, and provide necessary amenities. These court orders serve as a reminder to builders and developers to fulfill their promises and obligations to consumers, and to consumers to assert their rights and seek legal recourse when necessary.
