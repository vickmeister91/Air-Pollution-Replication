In a recent court hearing, a writ petition was presented challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Gujarat Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2002. The petitioner, who was the Chairman of a cooperative bank, is no longer in that position due to a merger with another bank. As a result, the petition was dismissed as infructuous, but the petitioner was given the liberty to challenge the vires of the provisions in an appropriate petition.

The Gujarat Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2002, was enacted to amend the Gujarat Cooperative Societies Act, 1961. The amendment aimed to provide for the registration and regulation of cooperative societies in the state of Gujarat. However, certain provisions of the amendment were challenged in the writ petition on the grounds of their constitutionality.

The petitioner, who was the Chairman of a cooperative bank, argued that the provisions in question were unconstitutional as they violated the fundamental rights of the members of the cooperative society. The petitioner contended that the provisions gave excessive powers to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, who could interfere in the functioning of the society without any valid reason.

However, the court dismissed the petition as infructuous as the petitioner was no longer the Chairman of the cooperative bank due to a merger with another bank. The court held that the petitioner no longer had the locus standi to challenge the provisions in question. Nevertheless, the court granted the petitioner the liberty to challenge the vires of the provisions in an appropriate petition.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Gujarat Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2002, as infructuous. The petitioner, who was the Chairman of a cooperative bank, was no longer in that position due to a merger with another bank. However, the petitioner was given the liberty to challenge the vires of the provisions in an appropriate petition.
