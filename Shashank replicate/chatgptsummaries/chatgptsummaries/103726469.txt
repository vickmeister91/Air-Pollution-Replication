The court orders pertain to writ petitions challenging circulars issued by the State Government regarding the procedure for holding a meeting of no confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor, as well as a meeting of no confidence held on July 16, 2009, in which only 12 out of 30 elected members attended.

In one court order, the court lists the parties involved in two cases, LPA No. 1564 of 2009 and LPA No. 1579 of 2009, but provides no details about the nature of the cases or the court's ruling.

Another court order pertains to a batch of appeals against a common order passed by a learned Single Judge. The order pertains to three writ petitions, namely, CWJC No.7646 of 2009, CWJC No.7567 of 2009 and CWJC No.8075 of 2009. The appeals are against the order passed by the learned Single Judge, whereby he directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a special meeting with regard to no confidence motion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance with the requisition as received and seek confidence of the House within the period as provided under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007. The order also discusses the factual exposition in all the cases and the commonality between them.

The court order discusses several writ petitions challenging the circular issued by the State Government regarding the procedure for holding a meeting of no confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor.

The court also noted that the District Magistrate could not have been conferred the power by executive instruction in the absence of a rule.

In another court order, the court discusses various sections of the Companies Act and the importance of compliance with accounting standards and presenting true and fair accounts. The court also cites other cases to establish the principle that if the provisions of an act can be given effect to, non-framing of rules would not vitiate the act. The court concludes that a vote of no confidence can be carried out without framing of rules and that the provisions of the statute are workable. The court also addresses the issue of convening another meeting for a vote of no confidence, stating that it is not in error to do so.

The court order pertaining to a meeting of no confidence held on July 16, 2009, in which only 12 out of 30 elected members attended, ruled that there was no proper notice given to all members and that the meeting was not valid. The court rectified the error and issued a direction to ensure that all members were properly noticed for the meeting. The appeals made against this ruling were dismissed.
