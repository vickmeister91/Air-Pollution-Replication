The court recently considered two writ petitions related to a tile factory that was causing pollution in a residential area. The first petition was filed by residents seeking action to stop the factory's operation, while the second petition was filed by the factory's managing partner challenging the withdrawal of their consent to operate due to unauthorized burning of sawdust and smoke escaping through channels other than the chimney.

After hearing both sides, the court found that the factory's actions were in violation of the consent to operate and refused to quash the order withdrawing it. The factory's counsel requested a hearing to reinstate the consent on appropriate conditions, which was opposed by the residents' counsel. However, the court did not make a decision on this matter.

In another case, the court set aside the Consent to Operate for a unit due to variance with the conditions imposed. The Pollution Control Board was directed to consider whether the unit's Consent to Operate can be reinstated with requisite conditions. Until then, the unit is not allowed to operate. The Pollution Control Board was given two months to complete the exercise. The court disposed of the case and ordered compliance with the orders.

The exhibits presented in the case included copies of complaints, licenses, and letters related to the case. The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of adhering to the conditions of consent to operate and the need for strict enforcement of pollution control measures.

In the first case, the court found that the factory's unauthorized burning of sawdust and smoke escaping through channels other than the chimney were in violation of the consent to operate. The court refused to quash the order withdrawing the consent and did not make a decision on the factory's request to reinstate the consent on appropriate conditions. This decision sends a strong message to industries that flout pollution control measures and emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of consent conditions.

In the second case, the court set aside the Consent to Operate for a unit due to variance with the conditions imposed. The Pollution Control Board was directed to consider whether the unit's Consent to Operate can be reinstated with requisite conditions. Until then, the unit is not allowed to operate. The Pollution Control Board was given two months to complete the exercise. The court disposed of the case and ordered compliance with the orders. This decision highlights the importance of adhering to the conditions of consent to operate and the need for strict enforcement of pollution control measures.

Overall, the court's decisions in both cases emphasize the importance of adhering to the conditions of consent to operate and the need for strict enforcement of pollution control measures. The court's decision to refuse to quash the order withdrawing the consent in the first case sends a strong message to industries that flout pollution control measures. The court's decision in the second case to set aside the Consent to Operate for a unit due to variance with the conditions imposed and direct the Pollution Control Board to consider reinstating it with requisite conditions highlights the need for strict enforcement of consent conditions. The exhibits presented in both cases, including copies of complaints, licenses, and letters related to the case, further emphasize the importance of adhering to pollution control measures and the need for strict enforcement.
