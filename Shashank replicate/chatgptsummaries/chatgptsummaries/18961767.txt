The case in question involved the prosecution of several individuals for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code. The accused parties had requested that the trial court exercise its jurisdiction and call for a complaint filed by one of the petitioners before the police. However, the trial court dismissed the application on the grounds that the document could be obtained under the Right to Information Act.

The petitioners then appealed to the Court of Sessions, which dismissed their revision. However, the High Court ultimately allowed the petition, stating that the trial court should have considered the relevance of the documents called for by the accused parties and that the provisions under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code are not a substitute for the Right to Information Act.

Specifically, the High Court noted that the trial court had erred in dismissing the application without considering the relevance of the documents requested by the accused parties. The court emphasized that the right to information is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution and that the Right to Information Act is a powerful tool for ensuring transparency and accountability in government.

The court also noted that Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows a court to call for documents or other evidence, is not a substitute for the Right to Information Act. While Section 91 may be used in certain circumstances, it cannot be used to circumvent the provisions of the Right to Information Act.

Ultimately, the High Court directed the trial court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code and call for the documents requested by the accused parties. The court emphasized that the trial court should carefully consider the relevance of the documents and ensure that the accused parties are not unduly burdened by the process.

This case highlights the importance of the right to information in ensuring transparency and accountability in government. It also underscores the need for courts to carefully consider the relevance of documents requested by accused parties and to ensure that the provisions of the Right to Information Act are not circumvented.
