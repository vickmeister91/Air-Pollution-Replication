In a recent court order, the plaintiff claimed to be the sole owner of a property and had entered into a collaboration agreement with the defendant for the reconstruction of the building on the said plot. The defendant had constructed the property up to the third floor, which was in violation of the agreement. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the third floor was illegal and constructed in violation of building bye-laws and the collaboration agreement. 

The defendant argued that the civil court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief under Section 347-E of the Delhi Municipal Act. However, the court allowed the plaintiff's amended plaint, which superseded the initial plaint, and held that the plaintiff had not challenged the sanctioning of the site plan but had pleaded that illegal construction was carried out in violation of building bye-laws. The court also held that the plaintiff's claim for declaration and cancellation of documents was maintainable.

The court order further stated that while there is no dispute with the legal precedent cited by the defense counsel, the specific circumstances of this case mean that the precedent does not apply. Therefore, the court ruled that the relief claimed in the suit is not barred by the DMC Act and that the civil court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The preliminary issue was decided in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant.

The case highlights the importance of collaboration agreements and building bye-laws in property disputes. It also emphasizes the need for parties to adhere to the terms of the agreement and comply with the relevant laws and regulations. In this case, the defendant's violation of the agreement and building bye-laws led to legal action by the plaintiff.

The court's decision to allow the plaintiff's amended plaint and maintain the claim for declaration and cancellation of documents is significant. It shows that the court is willing to consider the specific circumstances of a case and not just rely on legal precedent. This approach ensures that justice is served and that parties are held accountable for their actions.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder to property owners and developers to comply with the relevant laws and regulations and to ensure that collaboration agreements are followed. It also highlights the importance of seeking legal advice in property disputes to ensure that the rights of all parties are protected.
