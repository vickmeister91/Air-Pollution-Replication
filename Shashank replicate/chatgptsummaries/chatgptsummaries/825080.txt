The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Prakashan.C.K., who is the third accused in a case related to the Wildlife Protection Act. The court has denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner, but has allowed him to surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material. Once the petitioner has surrendered, he can then apply for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction.

The court has ordered the petitioner to surrender on either 20.09.2010 or 22.09.2010. This means that the petitioner must present himself before the investigating officer on one of these two dates. Failure to do so could result in further legal action being taken against him.

The denial of anticipatory bail means that the petitioner cannot avoid arrest by seeking bail in advance. Instead, he must surrender himself to the authorities and then apply for bail. This is a common practice in criminal cases, as it allows the investigating agency to question the accused and gather evidence before the accused is released on bail.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to surrender for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material is significant. It suggests that the court believes that there is evidence against the petitioner that needs to be gathered before a decision on bail can be made. This is a standard procedure in criminal cases, as it allows the investigating agency to build a strong case against the accused.

Once the petitioner has surrendered and the investigating agency has gathered the necessary evidence, he can then apply for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction. This means that the petitioner will have to appear before the magistrate and make a case for why he should be released on bail. The magistrate will consider the evidence presented by both the petitioner and the investigating agency before making a decision.

Overall, the court order in question is a standard procedure in criminal cases. The denial of anticipatory bail and the order to surrender for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material are common practices in such cases. The petitioner will now have to surrender himself and make a case for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction. The court's decision is a reminder that the law will take its course and that those accused of crimes will have to face the consequences of their actions.
