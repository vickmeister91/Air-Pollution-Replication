The court order pertains to four writ petitions that raise common issues regarding a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2011. The petitioners seek a declaration that the notification is not applicable to mining projects/units that already possess valid and subsisting environmental clearances. The court refers to relevant provisions of the 2006 notification and discusses the stages in the prior environmental clearance process for new projects. The validity of environmental clearance is also discussed.

The court examines the requirement of an environmental clearance (EC) for mining projects and activities. The validity of the EC is for the project life, subject to a maximum of 30 years. An amendment introduced in 2011 requires prior environmental clearance even at the stage of renewal of a mining lease. The petitioners seek a declaration that the Notification of 2011 does not apply to mining projects with valid and subsisting ECs. The court examines the EC granted to M/s S.N. Mohanty and the specific and general conditions that must be complied with.

The court discusses the conditions and safeguards required for mining operations to obtain environmental clearance. The specific and general conditions include monitoring groundwater levels, forestry clearance, noise control, and proper treatment of industrial wastewater. The court also examines a 2011 amendment requiring environmental clearance at the renewal stage, even for those who already have clearance. The respondents argue that this amendment is necessary to conform to the Supreme Court's directions in a previous case. The court examines the scope of the earlier notification and the Supreme Court's decision, ultimately concluding that the obligation to the community takes precedence over the obligation to individuals in cases of renewal.

The court order discusses the requirement of environmental clearance (EC) for mining operations in India. The court states that the obligation to society must take precedence over the obligation to individuals. The court also clarifies that the grant of renewal for a mining lease is a fresh grant and must be consistent with the law. The court further explains that the requirement of an EC applies to renewals as well, and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement, the requirement of the Act had to be satisfied before such renewal could be granted. The court also clarifies that if a person has a valid and subsisting EC at the point of time he seeks a renewal of the mining lease, he would not be required to obtain another EC prior to the grant of renewal by the respondents. The court allows the writ petitions and declares that the amendment introduced to Colum No.5 of the Schedule 1(a) of the Notification of 2006 would not apply to mining projects/units which already possess valid and subsisting ECs.

In summary, the court order discusses the requirement of environmental clearance for mining projects and activities in India. The court examines the validity of environmental clearance and the stages in the prior environmental clearance process for new projects. The court also discusses the conditions and safeguards required for mining operations to obtain environmental clearance. The court clarifies that the obligation to society takes precedence over the obligation to individuals and that the requirement of an EC applies to renewals as well. The court allows the writ petitions and declares that the amendment introduced to Colum No.5 of the Schedule 1(a) of the Notification of 2006 would not apply to mining projects/units which already possess valid and subsisting ECs.
