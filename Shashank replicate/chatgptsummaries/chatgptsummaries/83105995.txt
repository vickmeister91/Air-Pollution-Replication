The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Pawan Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state is also directed to provide a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments on the water bodies. The court imposes a compensation of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to publish notices to make citizens aware of this direction. The court also orders the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date and warns that a cost will be imposed if the state fails to submit the required reports and plans.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and the prevention of pollution in the canal. A committee was formed to demarcate encroachments and monitor their removal. The state government was directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures contributing to contamination of canal water. The compliance report filed by the state government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month. The state government was also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation from them. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the state government's compliance and warned of appropriate action if the directions were not followed.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide complete information and records relevant to the proceedings. The court has also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over civil cases related to environmental protection. The court has also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if the inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that the original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not yet been decided. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The case is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which has the power to condone the delay. The remedy given under the Act of 2010 is efficacious, and the writ court should be extremely slow in entertaining any issue under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The writ petition is dismissed with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters after December 31, 2016.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the removal of encroachments contributing to the contamination of canal water. The court has directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state has been ordered to provide a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments on the water bodies.

The court has warned of appropriate action if the state fails to submit the required reports and plans. The court has also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The writ petition has been dismissed with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.
