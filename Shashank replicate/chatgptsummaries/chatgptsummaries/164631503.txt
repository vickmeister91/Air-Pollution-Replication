The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus directing respondents 1 to 7 to revoke all permissions/clearances and to forbear from carrying on/permitting the carrying on of any mining activity at S.F.No.14(P) and S.F.No.4, Tirupalaivanam-I, Kanchivoyal, Ponneri Taluk. The petitioner contended that the mining activity was carried out in violation of the license granted by the Environmental Authority.

The court examined the facts and circumstances of the case and found that the mining activity was indeed carried out in violation of the license granted by the Environmental Authority. The court observed that the respondents had failed to comply with the conditions stipulated in the license and had carried out mining activity beyond the permissible limits. The court also noted that the respondents had failed to obtain the necessary clearances from the concerned authorities before commencing the mining activity.

In light of these findings, the court ordered that all permissions/clearances granted to the respondents for carrying out mining activity at S.F.No.14(P) and S.F.No.4, Tirupalaivanam-I, Kanchivoyal, Ponneri Taluk be revoked. The court also directed the respondents to forbear from carrying on/permitting the carrying on of any mining activity at the said locations. The court further ordered that whatever further action is taken for closure of the issue must be filed before this Court by compliance report.

The court's order is significant as it underscores the importance of complying with the conditions stipulated in licenses and obtaining the necessary clearances before commencing any activity that may have an impact on the environment. The court's order also serves as a warning to those who may be tempted to flout the law and carry out activities that may have an adverse impact on the environment.

It is important to note that the court's order was passed without imposing any costs on the petitioner. This is significant as it indicates that the court was satisfied with the petitioner's contentions and found merit in the arguments put forth by the petitioner. The court's decision to not impose any costs on the petitioner also serves as a reminder to litigants that they should not be deterred from approaching the court to seek redressal of their grievances.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder to all concerned that the environment must be protected at all costs and that any activity that may have an adverse impact on the environment must be carried out only after obtaining the necessary clearances and complying with the conditions stipulated in the licenses.
