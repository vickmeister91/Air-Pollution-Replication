In this court order, a landlord filed a petition against his tenant for non-payment of rent. The tenant was served with a legal notice of demand but failed to pay the arrears of rent. As a result, the tenant was proceeded ex-parte as he failed to appear before the court. The landlord was able to prove on record the relationship of landlord and tenant, arrears of rent, and non-payment of arrears of rent despite the demand notice.

The court, after considering the evidence presented by the landlord, ordered the eviction of the tenant from the tenanted premises. The file was then consigned to the record room. This means that the case has been closed and the court will not entertain any further proceedings in this matter.

The relationship between a landlord and tenant is governed by the terms of the lease agreement. The lease agreement outlines the rights and obligations of both parties. One of the primary obligations of the tenant is to pay rent on time. Failure to pay rent can result in legal action being taken against the tenant.

In this case, the tenant failed to pay rent despite being served with a legal notice of demand. The landlord was able to prove on record that the tenant had not paid the arrears of rent. The court, therefore, had no choice but to order the eviction of the tenant from the tenanted premises.

The eviction process can be a lengthy and complicated process. It is important for both landlords and tenants to understand their rights and obligations under the law. Landlords must follow the proper legal procedures when evicting a tenant. Tenants, on the other hand, have the right to defend themselves against eviction.

In this case, the tenant failed to appear before the court, which made it difficult for him to defend himself against the eviction. It is important for tenants to take legal notices seriously and to respond to them in a timely manner. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them.

In conclusion, this court order serves as a reminder to both landlords and tenants of the importance of fulfilling their obligations under the lease agreement. Landlords must ensure that they follow the proper legal procedures when evicting a tenant. Tenants must pay rent on time and respond to legal notices in a timely manner. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them.
