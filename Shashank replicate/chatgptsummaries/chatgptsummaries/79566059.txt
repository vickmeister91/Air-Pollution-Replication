The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case involving several stone crushing companies that had received closure notices from the Karnataka Pollution Control Board, despite operating under valid licenses. The companies sought a writ of certiorari to quash the notices and a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider their applications to operate their crushing units. 

The court found that the case was similar to a previous case in which the closure notice was quashed and a writ of mandamus was issued to permit the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity until their application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. The court followed the decision of the previous case and extracted the core of the judgment, which stated that existing stone crusher units have three months to trans-locate themselves to safer zones and must file an application with the Licensing Authority within a reasonable time.

The court order also stated that the petitioner had applied for a license in 2012, but the Licensing Authority did not grant or refuse the license within the prescribed time limit. The court directed the respondents to allow the petitioner to operate at the present site until the application is considered and disposed of. However, the order also mentioned that the Pollution Control Board cannot grant permission to the petitioner to operate in its present site, as it must relocate to a safer zone as identified by the State.

The court quashed Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 and allowed the stone crushing units of the petitioners to operate at the present site until their application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority. This decision provides some relief to the stone crushing companies, as they can continue to operate while their applications are being processed. However, they must also comply with the directive to relocate to safer zones within three months and file an application with the Licensing Authority within a reasonable time.

The court's decision is significant as it balances the interests of the stone crushing companies with the need to protect the environment and public health. The court recognizes that the companies have invested significant resources in their operations and have valid licenses, but also acknowledges the importance of ensuring that these operations do not harm the environment or public health. By allowing the companies to continue operating while their applications are being processed, the court provides some relief to the companies while also ensuring that they comply with environmental regulations.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of balancing economic interests with environmental concerns. While the stone crushing companies have a right to operate, they must also comply with environmental regulations and take steps to minimize their impact on the environment and public health. The court's decision provides a framework for achieving this balance and ensuring that economic development is sustainable and does not come at the expense of the environment or public health.
