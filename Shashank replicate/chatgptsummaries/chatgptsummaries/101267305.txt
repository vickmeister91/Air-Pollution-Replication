The Gujarat High Court recently heard two appeals against a judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge in Special Civil Application No.9722 of 1993 and Special Civil Application No.9626 of 1993. The appeals were directed against the imposition of scrutiny fee, security deposit, and premium, and the levy of development charges. The court ultimately quashed the notifications and the imposition of fees and charges. The appeals were heard by a Division Bench of the court.

The court order discusses the validity of various fees imposed by the HADA, including scrutiny fees, security deposits, premium fees, and development fees. The original petitioners argue that these fees must have a quid pro quo relationship with the services provided, while the State argues that the fees are justified and reasonable. The court examines the relevant provisions of the Act and concludes that there is an inbuilt mechanism for the levy and collection of fees, and that the fees imposed have a co-relation with the services to be rendered. The court also notes that the development authority must scrutinize proposals for development and ensure that they comply with the development plan.

The court order discusses the authority's power to scrutinize documents and ensure that development is made in accordance with the plan submitted. The security deposit is refundable upon compliance with specified conditions. The development fee collected must be used for the development of the entire area. The court rejects the argument that facts and figures must be presented to justify the quantum of fee imposed. The court also disagrees with the view that the authority must state the grounds and reasons for levying the maximum rate of development charges prescribed. The court finds that the classification of land for the purpose of development charges is not in contravention of the scheme of the Act or Article 14 of the Constitution. The court also discusses the scrutiny fee and its rates.

The court order discusses the scrutiny fee for carrying out any development work over any land. The fee is related to the services to be rendered by the authority to scrutinize all aspects of the proposed development to ensure it is in consonance with the development plan and not in contravention. The order also lists the various documents and particulars that need to be submitted along with the application for development work. These include a site plan, a detailed plan, and a certificate of supervision. The order also provides notations to be used for plans referred to in the regulations.

The court order outlines regulations for the construction of buildings and structures, including setback and margin requirements from plot boundaries and road lines. Plans and specifications must be prepared by licensed architects, engineers, or surveyors. Development in the Hajira Development Area is subject to various regulations depending on the location, including those related to classified roads, petroleum pipelines, oil wells, electricity grid lines, airports, railways, smoke and water pollution, and air pollution control. All development work must conform to the regulations and cannot be used for any purpose other than the sanctioned use without prior permission.

The court order states that any development work must comply with the regulations and cannot be used for any purpose other than the sanctioned use. Changing the use of a building or premises without prior permission is not allowed. The use must conform to zoning regulations. The court also upholds the imposition of a security deposit and a premium fee for construction made without prior permission. The court finds that the challenges made by the petitioners were without merit and dismisses the petitions.

The court order dismisses the petitions as they were without merit. The court also orders the recovery of unpaid fees with interest at a rate of 6% per annum until the amount is realized. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000 each on the original petitioners and orders them to pay within four weeks. The court declines the request to suspend the operation of the order.

In summary, the Gujarat High Court heard two appeals against the imposition of various fees and charges by the HADA. The court ultimately quashed the notifications and the imposition of fees and charges. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Act and concluded that the fees imposed have a co-relation with the services to be rendered. The court also discussed the authority's power to scrutinize documents and ensure that development is made in accordance with the plan submitted.
