The Bombay High Court has issued three court orders pertaining to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, which regulates developmental activities in areas falling within the municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Akshay Sthapatya Private Limited against the Union of India and four other respondents. The petition challenges the CRZ-2011 and seeks relief from the restrictions imposed on developmental activities in CRZ areas falling within the municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. The court provides a summary of the CRZ-2011 and its various categories, including CRZ-II, which pertains to areas developed close to the shoreline. The court also notes that areas requiring special consideration for development or redevelopment are regulated under paragraph V of CRZ-2011.

The second court order pertains to the regulation of development and redevelopment in the inter-connected islands of Greater Mumbai, specifically in CRZ II areas. It allows for slum rehabilitation schemes to be implemented by the State Government or its parastatal agencies, with certain conditions such as ensuring the stake of the State Government is not less than 51%. The order also mentions a letter from the Chief Executive Officer of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority requesting an amendment to CRZ-2011 to permit normal FSI to be utilized in areas comprised CRZ-II. The CRZ-2019 Notification was issued in January 2019, superseding CRZ-2011, and required fresh coastal zone management plans to be prepared by the State Coastal Zone Management Authorities.

The third court order pertains to a petition filed by a developer seeking relief from the restrictions imposed by the CRZ Notification, 2019. The court declared that the developer's land would be in CRZ-II as per the 2011 notification and the 2019 notification, and that development would be permitted as per the 2019 notification. The court directed the authorities to sanction building plans within eight weeks. The court also refused to stay the judgment, allowing the authorities to challenge it before the Supreme Court if they desire to do so.

The CRZ Notification, 2011, was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to regulate developmental activities in the coastal areas of India. The notification divides the coastal areas into four categories, namely CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III, and CRZ-IV. CRZ-I pertains to ecologically sensitive areas, while CRZ-II pertains to areas developed close to the shoreline. CRZ-III pertains to areas that are relatively undisturbed and are not designated as CRZ-I or CRZ-II, while CRZ-IV pertains to areas that have already been developed.

The CRZ Notification, 2019, superseded the CRZ Notification, 2011, and was issued with the objective of simplifying the regulatory framework for coastal zone management. The notification requires fresh coastal zone management plans to be prepared by the State Coastal Zone Management Authorities. The notification also allows for the development of tourism infrastructure in CRZ-II areas, subject to certain conditions.

The court orders issued by the Bombay High Court pertain to the regulation of developmental activities in CRZ-II areas falling within the municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. The court has allowed for slum rehabilitation schemes to be implemented by the State Government or its parastatal agencies, subject to certain conditions. The court has also permitted the utilization of normal FSI in areas comprised of CRZ-II, subject to an amendment to the CRZ Notification, 2011.
