Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a case where the plaintiff sought a declaration that certain documents executed by the defendant were null and void, and for a permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff's peaceful possession of a property. 

In the first case, Shri Tondi Singh filed a case against Shri Mahendera Singh and others for creating obstructions in the peaceful possession of a property owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought a declaration that any sale deed or agreement to sell executed by the defendant in exercise of his power under the GPA and Will executed by the plaintiff be declared null and void. The court examined the evidence presented by the plaintiff and found in favor of the plaintiff, granting the declaration and permanent injunction sought. 

In the second case, the plaintiff filed an additional affidavit in evidence, which included a registered GPA and an agreement to sell executed by the defendants. The court observed that a power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property. The court declared that the GPA and agreement to sell executed by the defendants were null and void as they were based on a cancelled GPA and Will. The court also restrained the defendants from creating any third-party interest in the suit property and interfering with the plaintiff's peaceful possession. The court held that the suit of the plaintiff was maintainable, not barred by limitation, properly valued, and had a cause of action. The court decreed the suit of the plaintiff with costs. 

In the third case, the court declared the registration of a property in the name of Sh. Rajesh Singh null and void, and has restrained the defendants from creating any hindrance or obstruction in the peaceful enjoyment of the plaintiff over the suit premises. The defendants are also restrained from creating any third party interest in the suit property on the basis of certain documents. The judgment has been sent to the concerned Sub Registrar for cancellation of the registered documents. The decree sheet will be prepared accordingly and the file will be consigned to the record room after due compliance. 

In all three cases, the court found in favor of the plaintiff and granted the declaration and permanent injunction sought. The court also restrained the defendants from creating any third-party interest in the suit property and interfering with the plaintiff's peaceful possession. The court held that the suit of the plaintiff was maintainable, not barred by limitation, properly valued, and had a cause of action. The court decreed the suit of the plaintiff with costs. 

These court orders highlight the importance of proper documentation and legal procedures when dealing with property transactions. It is essential to ensure that all documents are valid and legally binding to avoid any disputes or legal complications in the future. The court's decision to declare the documents null and void emphasizes the need for caution and diligence when executing property-related documents.
