The court order pertains to a dispute between Orissa Manganese & Minerals Ltd and Synergy Ispat Pvt Ltd over an agreement to sell iron ore. The appellant had terminated the agreement due to a violation of rules, but the respondent disputed the legality of the termination. The matter went to arbitration, and the High Court directed the appellant not to sell the iron ore to any third party without offering it to the respondent and to maintain accounts of the iron ore raised. However, the appellant claimed to have already set up a plant where all the iron ore was being consumed, and therefore, the question of selling it to a third party did not arise. The court accepted the appellant's claim and did not give any direction to sell the iron ore to the respondent during the pendency of the arbitration.
