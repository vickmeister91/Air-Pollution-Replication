On January 9, 2007, Justice V. Ramkumar issued a court order pertaining to a bail application filed by two individuals accused of killing a mouse deer in a reserve forest. The court denied anticipatory bail but allowed the accused to surrender before the Investigating Officer and apply for regular bail before a competent Magistrate. The accused were directed to surrender between January 10 and 15, 2007, and their bail application was to be disposed of on the same day.

The case involved the killing of a mouse deer, a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The accused were alleged to have killed the deer in the Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. The incident came to light when forest officials found the carcass of the deer in the forest and launched an investigation.

The accused had filed an anticipatory bail application before the court, seeking protection from arrest. However, the court denied the application, stating that the offence was serious in nature and that the accused were not entitled to anticipatory bail. The court also noted that the accused had not cooperated with the investigation and had absconded after the incident.

Despite denying anticipatory bail, the court allowed the accused to surrender before the Investigating Officer and apply for regular bail before a competent Magistrate. The court directed the accused to surrender between January 10 and 15, 2007, and their bail application was to be disposed of on the same day.

The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail but allow the accused to surrender and apply for regular bail is in line with the principles of natural justice. The accused have the right to be heard and to seek bail, but they must also cooperate with the investigation and face the consequences of their actions.

The court's order sends a strong message that wildlife crimes will not be tolerated and that those who commit such crimes will be held accountable. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats and imposes penalties for offences such as hunting, poaching, and killing of protected species.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of the killing of a mouse deer in a reserve forest is a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail but allow the accused to surrender and apply for regular bail is a fair and just approach that upholds the principles of natural justice. The accused must now face the consequences of their actions and cooperate with the investigation. The court's order is a step towards ensuring that wildlife crimes are not tolerated and that those who commit such crimes are held accountable.
