In the first court order, a revisional application under Section 115 C.P.C. was filed by the decree-holders against the non-petitioner-judgment-debtor for arrears of rent and ejectment. The non-petitioner had preferred an appeal in which a compromise was arrived at between the parties. The decree passed by the learned Munsif was modified and the compromise was made part of the decree. However, the judgment-debtor submitted an objection petition stating that he had been paying rent according to the decree of the appellate court and on refusal by the landlords to accept the rent and to issue receipt, rent had been regularly tendered through money-order. 

The learned District Judge accepted the appeal and set aside the order of the learned Munsif and ordered that the decree-holders were not entitled to proceed with the execution of the decree for ejectment unless the judgment debtor failed to deposit the arrears of rent up to March 15, 1974. Against the appellate judgment, the decree-holders had preferred this revision. However, the court held that the revision preferred by the decree-holders under Section 115, C.P.C. was not maintainable and that the decree passed by the learned District Judge was valid.

Moving on to the second court order, it discusses a compromise between a landlord and tenant regarding eviction. The court states that the compromise must indicate that the tenant is agreeing to suffer eviction because the landlord is entitled to it under the law. The court also notes that it is not necessary for the court to explicitly state that the compromise is lawful. 

The court examines various cases and concludes that the compromise in this case did not create a new tenancy and that the tenant had committed a breach of the compromise by not paying rent, thus losing the concession given to him. The court allows the landlord to proceed with the execution of the eviction decree.

In summary, the first court order dealt with a revisional application under Section 115 C.P.C. where the decree-holders were not allowed to proceed with the execution of the decree for ejectment unless the judgment debtor failed to deposit the arrears of rent up to March 15, 1974. The second court order discussed a compromise between a landlord and tenant regarding eviction and allowed the landlord to proceed with the execution of the eviction decree due to the tenant's breach of the compromise by not paying rent.
