In a recent court order, three accused individuals, Dharma Ram, Purakh Singh, and Sohan Singh, were granted bail in connection with F.I.R. No.12/21 at the Police Station Baap Regional Forest Office in District Jodhpur. The accused were charged with offences under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. 

The court granted bail to the accused on the condition that they furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. Additionally, the accused were ordered to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. 

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, to conserve and protect wildlife habitats. 

The granting of bail to the accused in this case is a significant development. It is important to note that bail is not a right but a privilege granted by the court. The court must consider several factors before granting bail, including the nature of the offence, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing or tampering with evidence. 

In this case, the court deemed it appropriate to grant bail to the accused. However, the court also imposed strict conditions to ensure that the accused do not abscond or tamper with evidence. The requirement to furnish a personal bond and two surety bonds is a common condition imposed by courts while granting bail. The accused must provide a financial guarantee to the court that they will appear for all hearings and comply with any other conditions imposed by the court. 

It is also important to note that the accused have been charged under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 deals with offences committed by companies. The accused may have been involved in hunting or poaching of wild animals, or they may have been part of a company that committed an offence under the Act. 

The Wild Life Protection Act is a stringent law that provides for severe penalties for offences committed under it. The Act provides for imprisonment for a term of three to seven years and a fine of Rs.10,000/- to Rs.25,000/- for hunting or poaching of wild animals. For offences committed by companies, the Act provides for a fine of Rs.50,000/- to Rs.1,00,000/-. 

In conclusion, the granting of bail to the accused in this case is a significant development. The court has imposed strict conditions to ensure that the accused do not abscond or tamper with evidence. The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The Act provides for severe penalties for offences committed under it, and it is important that the law is enforced effectively to protect our wildlife and their habitats.
