In a recent criminal case against Chhotu Lal Rathore, a petition was filed by Zakir Hussain to summon a cheque of Rs. 3,50,000 as evidence. However, the court rejected the petition and dismissed the stay application. The court found that the scope of section 91 CrPC is not to protect the accused from the misuse of documents and that the document can only be called if it is relevant during the course of the trial.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) deals with the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue a summons or order to produce such documents or things as it thinks fit.

In the present case, Zakir Hussain had filed a petition to summon a cheque of Rs. 3,50,000 as evidence in a criminal case against Chhotu Lal Rathore. The court, however, rejected the petition and dismissed the stay application. The court found that the scope of section 91 CrPC is not to protect the accused from the misuse of documents and that the document can only be called if it is relevant during the course of the trial.

The court observed that the document sought to be summoned was not relevant to the case and that it was being used as a tool to harass the accused. The court further stated that the accused cannot be made to suffer on the basis of irrelevant and unnecessary documents.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person should not be condemned without being given a fair opportunity to defend himself. The court's decision also upholds the principle of relevance, which requires that evidence should be relevant to the case and should not be used as a tool to harass the accused.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the petition to summon a cheque of Rs. 3,50,000 as evidence in a criminal case against Chhotu Lal Rathore is a welcome move. The decision upholds the principles of natural justice and relevance and ensures that the accused is not harassed on the basis of irrelevant and unnecessary documents.
