The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to industrial undertakings in Delhi and the decisions made by the Lt. Governor regarding their closure or continued operation. 

In the first case, Bajaj Food Products had filed a petition seeking permission to close its industrial undertaking, Delhi Cloth Mills at Bara Hindu Rao, Delhi. The Lt. Governor had previously rejected their application, prompting the petitioners to file a writ of certiorari to quash the decision. The court upheld the provisions of Section 25O of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 and directed the Lt. Governor to determine the application afresh within 60 days. However, the Lt. Governor once again refused permission to close the mill, prompting the court to review the decision. The court found that the impugned order did not address any of the reasons advanced by the petitioners for closure of the mill, and was therefore capricious and entitled to be struck down. The court directed the Lt. Governor to grant permission to close the mill within seven days, with the petitioners bound by the undertakings given to the court in the scheme of settlement for payment of compensation to the workers.

The second case involved a textile mill that was seeking permission to continue operating despite being a non-conforming industry under the Master Plan. The court rejected the mill's request, citing concerns about pollution caused by the mill's toxic effluents and the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan. The court also noted that the interest of the labor had been safeguarded by a settlement between the mill and the workers' unions. The court found that the Lt. Governor did not properly consider pertinent factors in making the decision to allow the mill to continue operating.

In the third case, the court found that the interest and welfare of the workers should be safeguarded, but in this particular case, the balance of public interest was not in favor of the Delhi Administration. The court granted permission to close the industrial undertaking of the petitioners at Bara Hindu Rao, Delhi, and directed the Lt. Governor to grant permission to close the mill within seven days. The petitioners were bound by the undertakings given to the court in the scheme of settlement for payment of compensation to the workers, and the parties were to bear their own costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of considering various factors when making decisions regarding the closure or continued operation of industrial undertakings. The interest and welfare of workers must be safeguarded, but public interest and environmental concerns must also be taken into account. The court plays a crucial role in ensuring that these factors are properly considered and that decisions are made in accordance with the law.
