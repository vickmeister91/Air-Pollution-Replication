The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against M/s Eldeco Infrastructure & Properties Ltd. under the Environment Protection Act. The complaint was related to the alleged violation of environmental norms by the company. However, the company had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate, which they argued made the complaint invalid. The company filed a petition seeking the quashing of the complaint and all subsequent proceedings.

The case was heard by the court, which agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint. The court's decision was based on a previous order passed by the court in a similar case. The court held that once an Environment Clearance Certificate is obtained, it is not necessary to obtain any further permission or clearance from the pollution control board. The court also observed that the pollution control board cannot take any action against a company if it has already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate.

The court's decision is significant as it provides clarity on the legal position regarding the validity of an Environment Clearance Certificate. The decision also highlights the importance of obtaining such a certificate before commencing any activity that may have an impact on the environment.
