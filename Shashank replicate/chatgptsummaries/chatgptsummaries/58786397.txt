The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Bhagirath, a resident of Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, regarding the issue of pollution of water in a minor canal passing through the district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and find out whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water and file a status report.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories upstream and downstream of populated areas to determine the standard of water. The state is also directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal within a specified time frame. The court imposes a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this penalty through various media. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of a related case.

The court orders the District Collector of Ganga Nagar to be present on the next hearing date and warns that a cost will be imposed if the state fails to submit a long-term and short-term plan and an action report. The court also directs the state to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments from the city of Sriganganagar and the prevention of pollution in the canals providing drinking water. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders.

The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notice to the persons who were contributing to the pollution as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The court further directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water.

The court order gives an opportunity to the Counsel for the State to file another response to the compliance report. The court orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental issues.

The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that the petitioner is seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concludes that the remedy given under Section 22 of the Act of 2010 is efficacious to meet the injury, if any caused to the petitioner, and if that involves any ground as required to invoke Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015.
