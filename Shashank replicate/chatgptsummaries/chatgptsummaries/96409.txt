A group of trade unions representing plantation workers in Valparai, Coimbatore District, have filed writ petitions against the Planter's Association of Tamil Nadu and various estates. The unions claim that the association's intention to terminate settlements regarding wages and working conditions is unfair and have requested withdrawal of the proposals. The court has advised both parties to have bilateral negotiations to resolve the issues amicably.

In another case, a dispute between a union and plantation owners over proposed changes to working conditions and wages is discussed. The union claims that the changes would result in a significant loss of income for workers and that the settlement cannot be reached without following proper procedures. The plantation owners argue that the changes are necessary due to financial constraints and that negotiations are ongoing. The court must determine whether the changes violate labor laws and whether the union has exhausted all available remedies before seeking court intervention.

The court order also discusses the maintainability of a writ petition regarding a labor-intensive industry that has cut down wages, and whether a writ can be issued against a private company. The court cites previous judgments and concludes that a writ can be issued to a private individual or company if they violate statutory or public duties or engage in monstrous activities. The court also notes that the issue at hand is contractual and not a violation of any public duty. The court discusses previous judgments related to the scope of the Factories Act, which aims to provide better living conditions for workers.

The scope and obligations of the Factories Act, 1948, which aims to provide better living conditions for workers, are also discussed in the court order. The Industrial Disputes Act deals with the fundamental rights, duties, obligations, and liabilities of both labor and management and involves public interest and public duty. The court finds that writ petitions are maintainable and that the forums constituted under the act are effective remedies. The court also discusses Section 33-A of the Act, which deals with the situation of an employer contravening the provisions of Section 33 of the Act during the pendency of the proceedings before the authorities under the Act. The court concludes that the employer must adhere to the statutory obligations under Section 33 of the Act and that the employee has the right to complain under Section 33-A of the Act, which will be treated as a dispute and dealt with accordingly.

The court order emphasizes the importance of adhering to statutory obligations under Section 33 of the Act, which prohibits employers from varying existing terms of employment to the disadvantage of workers. The court also highlights the right of workers to go on a lawful strike and the prohibition of strikes and lockouts under Sections 22 and 23 of the Act. The court criticizes the employer for not seeking permission before altering the conditions of service and depriving workers of their valuable right to resort to a legal strike. The court also dismisses the employer's plea of alternative remedy under Section 33-A of the Act and emphasizes the mandatory nature of seeking permission during the pendency of the dispute to maintain status quo. The court cites various judgments to support its ruling and emphasizes the importance of timely justice in a monstrous situation.

In another case, an employer violated a provision and argued that they should not be held accountable because there was a penalty in place. The court rejected this argument and stated that the penalty was only meant to punish the offender, not provide a remedy for the employee. The court also found that the alternate remedy argument could not be sustained, and that the situation created by the management was sufficient to invoke the court's jurisdiction. The court also discussed the issue of whether notice given to the Planters' Association of Tamil Nadu (PAT) was sufficient to bind individual employers/estates, and found that all negotiations and agreements had been made with PAT representing all the employers, and therefore the defense raised by the employers was without basis. The court ultimately found that the writ petitions were maintainable and the petitioners were entitled to relief.

Finally, the court order states that while the problems faced by the Plantation Industry may be valid, the employer cannot alter the existing service conditions without written permission from the authorities. The employer has the right to move the authority for altering the conditions of service during the pendency of the dispute, but the authority must pass a reasoned order after considering all materials and circumstances objectively. The writ petitions are allowed with liberty to the respondents to move the Conciliation Officer for permission under Section 33(1) of the Act before altering the conditions of service. Until then, the respondents must comply with the existing terms of the service conditions.

In summary, the court orders discussed various disputes between trade unions representing plantation workers and plantation owners over proposed changes to working conditions and wages. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to statutory obligations under the Factories Act and the Industrial Disputes Act, which aim to provide better living conditions for workers. The court also discussed the maintainability of writ petitions against private companies and the importance of timely justice in a monstrous situation. The court ultimately allowed the writ petitions and granted relief to the petitioners, while also advising both parties to have bilateral negotiations to resolve the issues amicably.
