The court order in question pertains to a suit brought by plaintiffs to establish their title in a patni taluk and to set aside an auction sale of the same. The sale took place in 1903 and the suit was filed in 1904, which raised the question of whether the suit was barred by the law of limitation. The Munsif held that the suit was not barred, but the District Judge held that it was. 

The plaintiffs argued that the sale was illegal and that they were entitled to the property. They claimed that the sale was conducted without proper notice and that the auction was not properly conducted. The defendants, on the other hand, argued that the sale was conducted properly and that the plaintiffs had no right to the property.

The court found that the suit was out of time for the adult plaintiffs, but not for the minor plaintiffs. The court also discussed the application of Section 8 of the Limitation Act and held that it did not apply to this case. Section 8 of the Limitation Act provides for the exclusion of time during which a plaintiff is a minor or of unsound mind. The court held that this provision did not apply in this case because the plaintiffs were not seeking to enforce any right to property during the period of minority.

The court also considered the question of whether the plaintiffs had been in possession of the property prior to the sale. The plaintiffs claimed that they had been in possession of the property for many years prior to the sale, while the defendants claimed that they had been in possession. The court found that the evidence was not clear on this point and that it would need to be determined at trial.

The court allowed the appeal and remanded the suit to the District Judge for a trial on the merits, regarding it as the suit of the minor plaintiffs. The court held that the minor plaintiffs were entitled to have their claim heard on the merits, even though the adult plaintiffs were barred by the law of limitation.

Overall, the court order in this case dealt with the question of whether a suit to establish title in a patni taluk and to set aside an auction sale of the same was barred by the law of limitation. The court found that the suit was out of time for the adult plaintiffs, but not for the minor plaintiffs. The court also discussed the application of Section 8 of the Limitation Act and held that it did not apply to this case.
