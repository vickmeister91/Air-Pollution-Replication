The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Shiv Hari against an order on charge passed by the trial court in a case titled 'State Vs Rajesh & Ors.' The FIR was registered on allegations of illegal water boring and theft. The trial court directed to frame charges against all accused persons, including Shiv Hari, for offences punishable under various sections of IPC and Environment Protection Act. Shiv Hari challenged the order on the grounds of lack of evidence and non-consideration of submissions.

The court heard both sides and examined the trial court record before concluding that the offence of conspiracy requires some kind of physical manifestation of agreement, and there was no evidence to suggest any conspiracy between Shiv Hari and other accused persons. The court order states that in order to prove the offense of conspiracy, physical manifestation of agreement is required, which may be evidenced by conscious acts or conduct of parties. Innocuous or inadvertent acts should not be considered. The prosecution must provide evidence of a meeting of minds between the accused persons.

In the present case, there is no evidence to connect the revisionist with the other accused persons, and therefore, the revisionist cannot be charged for the offense punishable under IPC. However, the revisionist can be charged under Section 5/15 Environment Protection Act for illegal boring on the plot under his ownership.

The court's decision is based on the principle that in order to prove a conspiracy, there must be some kind of physical manifestation of agreement between the accused persons.
