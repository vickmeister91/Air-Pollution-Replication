The Jharkhand High Court has issued an order for Manoj Kumar Jaisawal and Sunil Bhagat to surrender within a month in connection with a case registered under Sections 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 33A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court has directed that if they surrender within the said period, the trial court is to release them on bail, on furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- each with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of S.D.J.M, Lohardaga.

The case against Jaisawal and Bhagat is related to the violation of environmental laws. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 are two important pieces of legislation that aim to prevent and control pollution in India. The former act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, while the latter act provides for the prevention and control of water pollution.

The court's order to surrender and subsequent release on bail is a standard legal procedure in India. It is aimed at ensuring that the accused appear before the court and do not abscond. The bail amount is set at Rs. 10,000/- each, which is a relatively small amount. The two sureties of like amount each are also required to ensure that the accused do not flee.

The Jharkhand High Court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental laws in India. The country has been grappling with severe environmental issues, including air and water pollution, for several years. The government has taken several steps to address these issues, including the enactment of laws such as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

However, the implementation of these laws has been a challenge. Many industries and individuals continue to violate environmental laws, leading to severe environmental degradation. The Jharkhand High Court's order is a reminder that environmental laws must be taken seriously and that those who violate them will be held accountable.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's order for Manoj Kumar Jaisawal and Sunil Bhagat to surrender within a month in connection with a case registered under Sections 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 33A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is a significant step towards ensuring environmental protection in India. The court's order highlights the importance of environmental laws and sends a strong message to those who violate them. It is hoped that this order will serve as a deterrent to others and lead to greater compliance with environmental laws in the country.
