The court recently rejected Sri Markandaiah's petition to quash the rejection of his application for a new trade license to carry out Silencer Burning Welding Job. The court stated that there was no evidence to establish whether such a business could be undertaken in a residential zone and that permission or sanction from the authorities of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 was required. The court also noted that the no objection from some neighbors was not a substitute for the required sanction under the Act. Therefore, the rejection of the petitioner's application for a trade license was upheld.

The case of Sri Markandaiah is an interesting one, as it highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and sanctions before undertaking any business activity. In this case, Sri Markandaiah had applied for a new trade license to carry out Silencer Burning Welding Job, but his application was rejected on the grounds that he did not have the necessary permissions and sanctions to undertake such a business in a residential zone.

The court, in its ruling, noted that there was no evidence to establish whether such a business could be undertaken in a residential zone. The court also stated that permission or sanction from the authorities of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 was required. This is an important point, as it highlights the need for businesses to obtain the necessary permissions and sanctions before undertaking any activity that could potentially harm the environment or the health of the people living in the area.

The court also noted that the no objection from some neighbors was not a substitute for the required sanction under the Act.

Instead, they must obtain the necessary permissions and sanctions from the relevant authorities.

Overall, the case of Sri Markandaiah highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and sanctions before undertaking any business activity. It also highlights the need for businesses to be aware of the environmental and health implications of their activities, and to take steps to mitigate any potential harm.
