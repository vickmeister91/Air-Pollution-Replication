The Nadar Mahajana Sangam filed a writ petition to prevent the transfer of shares of the Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Ltd. However, the petition was dismissed by the learned single Judge, and the appellant filed a writ appeal. The court found that in the normal functioning of a private banking company, there is no participation or interference of the State or its authorities. The Reserve Bank of India provides regulatory measures to maintain a healthy economic atmosphere in the country. Private companies carrying on banking activity are kept under check so that their activities may not go wayward and harm the economy in general. The court held that private companies would normally not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, except in certain circumstances where there may be statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned, including the companies.

The court order emphasizes that a writ may not be issued if there is no non-compliance or violation of statutory provisions by a private body. The powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India should be sparingly used and only in clear cases where a person's rights have been seriously infringed and they have no other adequate and specific remedy available to them. The court dismisses the writ appeal filed by the appellant as they have no locus standi to file the writ petition.

The court's decision in this case highlights the limited scope of the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court held that private companies would normally not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, except in certain circumstances where there may be statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned, including the companies.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of regulatory measures in maintaining a healthy economic atmosphere in the country. Private companies carrying on banking activity are subject to these measures, and the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India should only be used in clear cases where a person's rights have been seriously infringed and they have no other adequate and specific remedy available to them.
