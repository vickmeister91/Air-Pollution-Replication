The court order in question pertains to a case filed by the Punjab State Pollution Control against Daljit Singh and Jatinder Singh for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Kharar. However, the petitioner filed a revision petition to set aside the impugned order.

Upon examination of the case, the court found that the order was contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and set it aside. The complaint was restored to its original position, and the parties were directed to appear before the trial court for further proceedings. The trial court was also directed to speed up the trial and finish the case within six months.

The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution. The act provides for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintenance or restoration of the wholesomeness of water. It also establishes the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Boards to carry out the provisions of the act.

In this case, the Punjab State Pollution Control had filed a complaint against Daljit Singh and Jatinder Singh for violating the provisions of the act. However, the complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Kharar. This means that the case was dismissed because the prosecution failed to appear in court or failed to take any action in the case.

The petitioner, in this case, filed a revision petition to set aside the impugned order. A revision petition is a legal remedy available to a party aggrieved by an order passed by a subordinate court. The revision petition is filed before the higher court, which has the power to examine the legality and correctness of the order passed by the subordinate court.

Upon examination of the case, the court found that the order was contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Criminal Procedure Code is a procedural law that governs the procedure to be followed in criminal cases. The court found that the order passed by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Kharar, was not in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The court, therefore, set aside the impugned order and restored the complaint to its original position. This means that the case will now be heard by the trial court, and the parties will have to appear before the court for further proceedings.

The court also directed the trial court to speed up the trial and finish the case within six months. This is an important direction as it ensures that the case is heard and decided within a reasonable time frame. Delay in the disposal of cases is a significant problem in the Indian judicial system, and this direction by the court is a step towards addressing this issue.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is significant as it sets aside an order that was contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and restores the complaint to its original position. The direction to speed up the trial and finish the case within six months is also an important step towards ensuring that cases are heard and decided within a reasonable time frame. The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is an essential piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution, and this case highlights the importance of enforcing the provisions of the act.
