The court order pertains to a writ application filed by M/s. Rajdhani Timber Products challenging the allotment of additional land by the government and seeking a revision of the premium cost of the land. The petitioner claimed that they were entitled to the benefits of IPR 1979-83 and IPR-1980. However, the court noted that the petitioner was not entitled to these benefits and directed them to deposit the premium amount as determined by the government to settle the land.

The court also noted that the petitioner did not follow the proper procedure for allotment of the land. Therefore, they were not entitled to the benefits of the land. The court ordered the petitioner to deposit the premium amount as determined by the government to settle the land.

In another court order, the petitioner was not granted the benefit claimed for allotment of land as it was not rooted through the Industries Department of the Government. The State Government had suspended licenses granted to all wood-based industries, including the petitioner's small-scale industry, due to a direction given by the apex court in T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India and others. As a result, the purpose for which the petitioner required additional land had failed, and the question of allotment of the same did not arise. The writ application was dismissed.

In both court orders, the petitioner's claims were dismissed. The court noted that the petitioner did not follow the proper procedure for allotment of the land and was not entitled to the benefits of the land. The court also noted that the State Government had suspended licenses granted to all wood-based industries, including the petitioner's small-scale industry, due to a direction given by the apex court in T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India and others. Therefore, the purpose for which the petitioner required additional land had failed, and the question of allotment of the same did not arise.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of following proper procedures for allotment of land and obtaining necessary licenses and permits. It also emphasizes the need to comply with court orders and directives given by the apex court. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of claims and the loss of benefits and opportunities.
