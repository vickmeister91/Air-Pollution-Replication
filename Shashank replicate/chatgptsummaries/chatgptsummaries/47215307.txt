The court order pertains to a bail application made by Parsadi, who is accused of killing a tiger. Parsadi's counsel argued that he did not kill the tiger and that the allegations were against another person named Kailash. The prosecution, however, argued that Parsadi was guilty of keeping the moustache hairs of the dead tiger, which falls under the definition of 'TROPHY' as defined under section 2(31) of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court dismissed the bail application and granted Parsadi the liberty to file a fresh bail application if charges were framed against him. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties. Parsadi's counsel argued that he did not kill the tiger and that the allegations were against another person named Kailash. The prosecution, however, argued that Parsadi was guilty of keeping the moustache hairs of the dead tiger, which falls under the definition of 'TROPHY' as defined under section 2(31) of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court found that the prosecution's argument was more convincing and that Parsadi was guilty of keeping the moustache hairs of the dead tiger. The court also noted that Parsadi had only disclosed the existence of three moustache hairs of the dead tiger. The court found this to be suspicious and believed that Parsadi was trying to hide something.

The court's decision was based on the Wild Life Protection Act, which prohibits the killing of tigers and the possession of any part of a tiger's body. The court found that Parsadi had violated this law by keeping the moustache hairs of the dead tiger. The court also noted that Parsadi had not provided any evidence to support his claim that he did not kill the tiger.

The court's decision to dismiss the bail application was based on the seriousness of the offense and the evidence presented by the prosecution. The court believed that Parsadi was a flight risk and that he could tamper with the evidence if he was released on bail. The court, therefore, denied Parsadi's bail application and granted him the liberty to file a fresh bail application if charges were framed against him.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Parsadi's bail application was based on the evidence presented by both parties. The court found that Parsadi was guilty of keeping the moustache hairs of the dead tiger, which falls under the definition of 'TROPHY' as defined under section 2(31) of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court also believed that Parsadi was a flight risk and that he could tamper with the evidence if he was released on bail. The court, therefore, denied Parsadi's bail application and granted him the liberty to file a fresh bail application if charges were framed against him.
