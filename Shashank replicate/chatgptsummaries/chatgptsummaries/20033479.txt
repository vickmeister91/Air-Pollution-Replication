The court recently heard three applications for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The applications were filed on behalf of the petitioners Asgar Khan, Sanjay Kurariya, and Bihari Singh Sikarwar in Forest Crime No.28060/2013 registered by Incharge Regional Tiger Strike Force, Sagar, District- Sagar under Sections 50, (3)(4)(6)(8), 51, 52 and 57 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution case was that the petitioners accepted bribes and allowed the real culprits to go spot-free. 

During the hearing, the court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately denied the petitioners' request for anticipatory bail. The court believed that the allegations against the petitioners were serious and that they could not be granted anticipatory bail. The court also noted that the petitioners had not cooperated with the investigation and had not provided any evidence to support their claims of innocence.

In a separate case, the court dismissed the first applications for anticipatory bail filed by Asgar Khan, Sanjay Kurariya, and Bihari Singh Sikarwar in the case of Misc. Criminal Case No.19606/2018 against the State of M.P. The court believed that the facts and circumstances of the case did not warrant anticipatory bail for the petitioners. The court noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claims of innocence and that the allegations against them were serious.

The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the petitioners is significant as it means that they could be arrested at any time. The court's decision also sends a strong message that those who are accused of serious crimes cannot expect to be granted anticipatory bail without providing evidence to support their claims of innocence.

Overall, the court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims of innocence when seeking anticipatory bail. It also underscores the seriousness of the allegations against the petitioners and the need for a thorough investigation into the matter.
