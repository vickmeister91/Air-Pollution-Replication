The State of Gujarat appealed against a judgment by the High Court of Gujarat that granted Essar Oil Limited the benefit of Sales Tax incentive under the Government of Gujarat's Capital Investment Incentive to Premier/Prestigious Unit Scheme, 1995-2000. The scheme provided Sales Tax incentives for Premier/Prestigious Units according to the location, investment, and status of the project. Essar fell under the category of Premier Unit and opted for the Sales Tax deferment scheme. The duration of the incentive was to be for a period of 17 years from the date of commercial production. The High Power State Level Committee was the Sanctioning Authority for granting permanent registration of all the Prestigious/Premier Units.

The court order outlines the procedure for granting temporary and permanent registration to eligible prestigious/premier units. The order also mentions the necessary documents required for registration, including a receipt for filing the IEM, NOC from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, and a detailed project report. The order also provides background information on Essar's project in Vadinar, Gujarat, and the approvals and permissions required for the project, including permission under the Forest Conservation Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The order mentions Essar's application for registration under the Premier/Prestigious Unit Scheme and the proposal for diversion of forest land for the project.

The court order pertains to Essar's request for approval to divert 15.49 hectares of forest land for the construction and operation of offshore and onshore facilities for a refinery project. The state government granted permission subject to compliance with certain conditions, including obtaining permission from the central government and clearance under the Coastal Regulation Zone Regulations. Essar started construction work but was forced to stop by the state forest department, which filed a criminal complaint against Essar and its contractor. Essar was granted approval under the Forest Conservation Act in 1999, but subsequent PILs filed by environmental groups led to the High Court restraining the government from granting further authorization for laying pipelines in the Marine National Park and Sanctuary. Essar filed a review/recall application seeking to overturn the judgment.

The court order pertains to a case involving Essar's project at Vadinar and a judgment and order passed by the High Court in 2000. Essar sought a review and recall of the judgment and order, which was rejected by the High Court. The Government of Gujarat extended the time for going into commercial production for Essar, and Essar challenged the High Court's judgment and order by filing a Special Level Petition. The court granted a stay of the judgment insofar as Essar was concerned. The Industries Commissioner refused to grant any further extension of time for Essar to go into commercial production, and Essar submitted representations to different authorities of the State Government. The court quashed and set aside the High Court's judgment and directed the State Government to issue authorization to Essar for laying oil pipeline in the National Marine Park/Sanctuary area. The Chief Wild Life Warden issued the requisite permission, and the accused officials and contractors of Essar involved in the Criminal Case of 1999 were discharged from all charges.

Essar requested an extension of time for the commencement of commercial production for the purpose of sales tax deferment incentive scheme. The state government constituted a committee to consider the representations made by Essar and other companies. Essar filed a writ petition before the High Court, contending that it was prevented from completing the project and could not commence commercial production within the time limit. The High Court excluded the intervening period and extended the time limit for commencement of commercial production. The court gave a direction to the state government while considering Essar's application for incentives. The judgment is not by consent, and the respondents are entitled to the benefit of the Sales Tax Waiver Scheme.

The court order states that a party cannot lose the benefit of a Sales Tax Waiver Scheme due to an act of court, such as an order of injunction. The concept of restitution is explained as restoring parties to their original position before an erroneous court action displaced them. Restitution is a remedy against unjust enrichment or benefit, and the obligation to restitute lies on the party that received the unjust benefit. The court debates whether the respondent's inability to avail the benefit of the scheme is due to their own act or the appellant's act. Due diligence must be exhibited by the party seeking equity, and if the state has not received any unjust benefit, there is no question of restitution.

The court order discusses the principles of restitution and actus curiae in relation to a case where the state filed an SLP against orders passed by the High Court on PILs. The court found that the principle of restitution cannot be applied against the state as it did not gain any benefit from the orders. The actus curiae principle was also discussed, which states that an act of the court cannot prejudice anyone. The court found that a mere erroneous judgment of a court cannot be a ground for restitution. The court also considered whether the orders passed by the High Court resulted in any undue advantage to the appellant and whether the actus curiae principle can be invoked in this case. The court found that the principles of restitution were not applicable in this case.

The court order pertains to a case where the respondent had given up its claim of irrevocable license in order to revive the suit, but later tried to urge the same plea before the Trial Court and this Court. The court held
