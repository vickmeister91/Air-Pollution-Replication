The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri Naga Stone Quarry seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondents from blocking access to their property through a connecting road passing through a forest area. The petitioner had obtained all necessary clearances for stone quarrying on private patta land. However, the respondents, who are forest officials, had blocked the road, thereby curtailing the petitioner's right to access their property.

The court, after hearing both parties, directed the respondents to provide a right of way restricted to a width of 12 feet. The court also directed the respondents to conduct surprise inspections to ensure that the width is not increased. The petitioner was held liable for any violations committed by lorry owners, drivers, or employees.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the petitioner's right to access their property. The court recognized that the petitioner had obtained all necessary clearances for stone quarrying on private patta land and that the respondents had no right to block the road. The court's decision also ensures that the respondents cannot arbitrarily increase the width of the right of way, thereby protecting the forest area.

The court's decision is also significant as it holds the petitioner liable for any violations committed by lorry owners, drivers, or employees. This means that the petitioner must ensure that their employees and contractors comply with all relevant laws and regulations. This is an important step towards ensuring that the environment is protected and that the rights of all parties are respected.

Overall, the court's decision is a balanced one that takes into account the rights of both parties. The court recognizes the petitioner's right to access their property while also ensuring that the forest area is protected. The court's decision also holds the petitioner liable for any violations committed by their employees and contractors, thereby ensuring that all parties are held accountable for their actions.
