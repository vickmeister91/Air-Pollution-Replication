The court order in question pertains to a case between Seenappa and Smt Ademma. The appeal was filed against the concurrent findings of the courts below granting a decree for injunction in favor of the respondent. The father of the first appellant executed a registered sale deed in respect of the suit property in favor of the plaintiff, the respondent herein. The respondent continued in possession of the suit property all along, and there was an obstruction to the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit property in the year 1984. The suit came to be decreed, and the appeal by the appellants before the first appellate court was also dismissed, confirming the decree for injunction. The appeal was dismissed, and no substantial question of law for consideration arose in this appeal.

To provide some context, an injunction is a legal remedy that requires a person to do or refrain from doing a certain act. In this case, the respondent was granted a decree for injunction, which means that the court ordered the appellants to refrain from obstructing the respondent's peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit property.

The dispute in this case arises from the fact that the father of the first appellant executed a registered sale deed in favor of the respondent, who continued to possess the property. However, in 1984, there was an obstruction to the respondent's peaceful possession and enjoyment of the property. As a result, the respondent filed a suit, which was decreed in their favor. The appellants then filed an appeal before the first appellate court, which was also dismissed, confirming the decree for injunction.

The appellants then filed another appeal, which is the subject of this court order. However, the court found that no substantial question of law for consideration arose in this appeal and dismissed it.

Overall, this court order reaffirms the importance of peaceful possession and enjoyment of property and the legal remedies available to protect these rights. It also highlights the need for parties to respect the terms of registered sale deeds and to seek legal recourse if their rights are infringed upon.
