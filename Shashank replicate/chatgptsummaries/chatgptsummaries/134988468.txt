The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Sajith A.K. and two others seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C. No. 3224/2018 on the file of Principal Senior Civil Judge and ACJM Puttur D.K. The petitioners were accused of transporting deer skin and nails of a tiger, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioners argued that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was not authorized under Section 55 of the Act to file a complaint against them. However, the court rejected their contention and dismissed the petition, as the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station fell within the definition of an authorized officer under the Act.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the appointment of authorized officers who are empowered to investigate and prosecute offences under the Act.

In the present case, the petitioners were accused of transporting deer skin and nails of a tiger, which are prohibited under the Act. The Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station filed a complaint against the petitioners under Section 55 of the Act, which empowers authorized officers to file complaints in court. However, the petitioners argued that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was not an authorized officer under the Act and therefore, could not file a complaint against them.

The court rejected the petitioners' contention and held that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station fell within the definition of an authorized officer under the Act. The court observed that the Act defines an authorized officer as any person appointed by the Central Government or the State Government to be an authorized officer for the purposes of the Act. The court noted that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was appointed as an authorized officer by the State Government under Section 38 of the Act and therefore, was empowered to file a complaint against the petitioners.

The court also observed that the petitioners had failed to produce any evidence to show that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was not authorized to file a complaint against them. The court held that the burden of proof was on the petitioners to show that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was not an authorized officer under the Act, and since they had failed to discharge this burden, their contention had to be rejected.

In light of the above, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioners seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C. No. 3224/2018 on the file of Principal Senior Civil Judge and ACJM Puttur D.K. The court held that the Inspector of Puttur Town Police Station was an authorized officer under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and was empowered to file a complaint against the petitioners for the alleged violation of the Act. The court also observed that the petitioners would have the opportunity to contest the charges against them during the trial, and that the present petition was premature and misconceived.
