The Madras High Court received several writ petitions and miscellaneous petitions regarding the establishment of a new bus stand in Tindivanam Ery land. The petitioners argued that the resolution passed by the Tindivanam Municipality to establish the new bus stand was illegal, arbitrary, and contrary to environmental law. They requested a writ of declaration to declare the resolution as such and to direct the respondents to implement G.O.Ms.No.136 dated 15.9.2006. The court disposed of both writ petitions by a common judgment, stating that the construction of the new bus stand on the Ery land was not in the public interest and would cause damage to the water resources and ecology of Tindivanam Town. The court noted that the Municipality had passed two conflicting resolutions regarding the establishment of the new bus stand and sought clarification.

The court order discusses the establishment of a new bus stand in Tindivanam and the legal issues surrounding it. Two resolutions were passed by the Tindivanam Municipality, one to establish the bus stand in Tindivanam Ery and the other in Wakf Board land. The court dismissed a public interest litigation to quash the resolution to establish the bus stand in Wakf Board land. The government granted permission to the municipality to take over 6 acres of land from the Wakf Board on a lease basis for the bus stand. However, the municipality passed a resolution in 2006 seeking to establish the bus stand in the Ery site, which was already discarded. The court declared this resolution illegal and in violation of environmental laws. The municipality argued that all procedures were followed for the purchase of the land and that the resolution was not in violation of any laws.

The court order describes the process of selecting a site for a bus stand in Tindivanam. The proposal was sent in 1997, and various inspections and reports were conducted over the years. The government eventually granted permission to acquire land belonging to the Wakf Board in 2005, and a temporary bus stand was inaugurated in 2005. However, in 2008, a committee was formed to identify alternate sites for the bus stand, and it was found that the Tindivanam Ery site was the best suited. The report also states that the construction of the bus stand at this site would not affect the water storage capacity of the tank.

The court order discusses the establishment of a new bus stand in Tindivanam, Tamil Nadu, on land owned by the municipality. The petitioners argue that the proposed site is an Ery, a type of water body, and that the construction of the bus stand would lead to environmental degradation and depletion of groundwater. However, the court finds that the proposed site is suitable for the bus stand and that the construction would not affect the water storage capacity or cause flooding. The court also notes that the existing bus stand is insufficient and causes traffic congestion, and that the new bus stand would serve the needs of the town and its residents. The court cites various government orders and court decisions that emphasize the importance of protecting water bodies from encroachment, but ultimately concludes that the proposed bus stand would not violate these principles.

The court order discusses various cases related to the protection of natural water resources such as ponds, tanks, and Erys. The court held that even if a part of a pond has become dry and filled up, it does not lose its character as a pond, and therefore, the government cannot alienate it. The court also directed the state government to take necessary steps to restore natural water storage resources to their original status as part of rainwater harvesting schemes. The court further discussed the need to protect Erys and other water bodies and harmonize the need for development with the need to protect natural resources. The court also discussed the proposal to establish a bus stand on Ery land and the various inspections and opinions of authorities regarding the same.

The court order discusses the transfer of land for the construction of a bus stand in Tindivanam. The government passed two orders allowing the transfer of land, but the project did not come to fruition. The third respondent municipality passed a resolution to proceed with the land brought from the revenue department at the Tindivanam Ery site. However, the use of water bodies for alternate use has come under scrutiny, and the court suggests that the government should consider the changed circumstances and new laws before deciding on the transfer of Ery land. The court also notes that subsequent events of fact or law can be taken into consideration while deciding a case.

The court order states that the decision on whether to locate a bus stand at a particular site should be made by the government, taking into consideration various laws and court rulings related to the protection of water bodies and the environment. The court cannot substitute its view for that of the government, but it can issue a mandamus to the government to pass appropriate orders. The court emphasizes the need for a balance between development and environmental protection, and the government's role in protecting water bodies. The court also dismisses certain petitions and orders that no further steps should be taken for construction of the bus stand until a final decision is made by the government.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court received several writ petitions and miscellaneous petitions regarding the establishment of a new bus stand in Tindivanam Ery land. The court disposed of both writ petitions by a common judgment, stating that the construction of the new bus
