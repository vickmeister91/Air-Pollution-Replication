The court order pertains to two cases where the petitioners had applied for allotment of retail outlets by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). In the first case, the petitioner was a physically handicapped person who had applied for the allotment of a retail outlet. The Deputy Commissioner had refused to grant the No Objection Certificate (NOC) despite obtaining NOCs from seven concerned departments. The petitioner had filed a writ petition which was disposed of by the court directing the issuance of NOC if there was no disqualification. However, a complaint was submitted by an advocate regarding the lease deed, which had already been cancelled. The Deputy Commissioner rejected the NOC based on this complaint, which the court found to be without merit and quashed the impugned order.

In the second case, the petitioner had applied for the allotment of a petrol pump, but the application was rejected due to the non-cancellation of an earlier lease. The rejection was based on a complaint received from an advocate, which was found to be correct by the District Revenue Officer. However, the court found that the complaint lacked reason and application of mind, and set aside the rejection. The court also dismissed an application for impleadment by the complainant, citing lack of locus standi. The court directed the Indian Oil Corporation to seek a No Objection Certificate from the Forest Department if necessary.

In both cases, the court found that the rejection of the applications was not justified. The court observed that the petitioners had fulfilled all the necessary requirements for the allotment of retail outlets and petrol pumps. The court also noted that the complaints against the petitioners lacked merit and were not based on any valid grounds.

The court emphasized that the right to carry on trade or business is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The court held that the authorities cannot arbitrarily reject applications for the allotment of retail outlets and petrol pumps without any valid reasons. The court also observed that the authorities must apply their minds and take into account all relevant factors before rejecting such applications.

The court further observed that the authorities must act fairly and transparently while dealing with such applications. The court held that the authorities cannot reject applications based on complaints that lack merit or are not based on any valid grounds. The court also held that the authorities must provide reasons for their decisions and must give the applicants an opportunity to be heard before rejecting their applications.

The court directed the Indian Oil Corporation to issue NOCs to the petitioners if there were no disqualifications and to seek a No Objection Certificate from the Forest Department if necessary. The court also directed the authorities to act fairly and transparently while dealing with such applications and to provide reasons for their decisions.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two cases where the petitioners had applied for the allotment of retail outlets and petrol pumps by Indian Oil Corporation. The court found that the rejection of the applications was not justified and that the complaints against the petitioners lacked merit. The court directed the Indian Oil Corporation to issue NOCs to the petitioners if there were no disqualifications and to seek a No Objection Certificate from the Forest Department if necessary. The court also directed the authorities to act fairly and transparently while dealing with such applications and to provide reasons for their decisions.
