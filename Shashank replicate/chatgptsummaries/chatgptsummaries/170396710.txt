In a recent case, Swami Bajranand Ji filed a petition against an order issued by the Collector, District Shivpuri, under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner was issued a notice to show cause for violation of non-forest activity, which was contrary to the license given to the petitioner under the Schedule Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Right) Act, 2006. The petitioner claimed that he was granted Community Forest Rights by the committee under the provision of the Act, 2006, and was carrying out religious activity over the site.

The court disposed of the petition with a direction to the petitioner to appear before the Collector, District Shivpuri, along with the documents and reply to assert his claim under Community Forest Rights and plead his part of truth. The Collector was directed to pass a reasoned order in accordance with the law within three months from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the order. The status quo in respect of the land in question shall be maintained by the parties, and forest dwellers shall be allowed to visit the Aashram and temple without any obstacle until the proceedings are decided by the Collector.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of forest dwellers and recognizes the importance of community forest rights. The Schedule Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Right) Act, 2006, provides for the recognition of forest rights of forest-dwelling communities, including the right to live in and cultivate forest land, and the right to use and protect forest resources. The Act also recognizes the role of forest-dwelling communities in the conservation of forests and wildlife.

The court's direction to the Collector to pass a reasoned order in accordance with the law within three months from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the order is also significant.
