In the case of Ashok Sarkar, the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceeding against him in connection with C.P. Case No. 998 of 2007. The petitioner's counsel argued that a similar case had been quashed by a coordinate bench of the court. The court issued an urgent notice to the Opposite Party No. 2 and ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner until the next hearing on December 10, 2014.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner sought to quash the criminal proceeding against him on the grounds that a similar case had been quashed by a coordinate bench of the court.

The court issued an urgent notice to the Opposite Party No. 2, which refers to the party against whom the petitioner has filed the case. This notice was issued to inform the party that the petitioner has filed a petition to quash the criminal proceeding against him and to give them an opportunity to respond to the petition. The court also ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner until the next hearing on December 10, 2014. This means that the petitioner cannot be arrested or detained until the next hearing.

The court's decision to issue an urgent notice and order no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner until the next hearing is significant. It shows that the court is taking the petitioner's petition seriously and is willing to consider his arguments. It also provides the petitioner with some relief as he cannot be arrested or detained until the next hearing.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the inherent powers of the High Court. These powers allow the court to make orders that are necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, prevent abuse of the process of any court, or secure the ends of justice. In this case, the court used its inherent powers to issue an urgent notice and order no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner until the next hearing.
