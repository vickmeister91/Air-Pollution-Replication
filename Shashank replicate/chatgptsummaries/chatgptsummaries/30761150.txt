The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by V. Lakshmipathi and Shabri Granites Private Limited against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners sought to set aside an order passed by the learned Prl. Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.) and JMFC, Kanakapura, in C.C. No.69/2007 taking cognizance for the offences punishable under Sections 24(f)(g), (gg)(h), 73(d) of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, Rule 144 of the Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969, and Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act and issuing summons against the petitioners and to quash the entire proceedings thereon.

The court allowed the petition and set aside the order, stating that the investigation held by the respondent is admittedly without the requisite permission of the jurisdictional Magistrate i.e. the trial Court, and therefore the charge-sheet filed on the basis of such investigation is not in accordance with law.

The case in question involves allegations of violations of various provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, the Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969, and the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioners, V. Lakshmipathi and Shabri Granites Private Limited, were accused of committing these violations and were issued summons by the learned Prl. Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.) and JMFC, Kanakapura, in C.C. No.69/2007.

The petitioners challenged this order and sought to have it set aside. They argued that the investigation conducted by the respondent was without the requisite permission of the jurisdictional Magistrate, and therefore the charge-sheet filed on the basis of such investigation was not in accordance with law.

The court agreed with the petitioners and set aside the order. The court noted that the investigation conducted by the respondent was indeed without the requisite permission of the jurisdictional Magistrate, and therefore the charge-sheet filed on the basis of such investigation was not in accordance with law.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures in conducting investigations and filing charge-sheets. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to law enforcement agencies to ensure that they obtain the requisite permission of the jurisdictional Magistrate before conducting investigations and filing charge-sheets.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the petitioners and serves as an important reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures in conducting investigations and filing charge-sheets.
