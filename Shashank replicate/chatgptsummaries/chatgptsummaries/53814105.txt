The court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff appealed against a judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge, Rourkela in T.A. No. 02 of 1990 affirming the judgment and decree passed by the Subordinate Judge, Rourkela in T.S. No. 27 of 1984. The suit was for a declaration that the notice issued by the Notified Area Council (Civil Township), Rourkela under Sec. 273-A of the Odisha Municipal Act is invalid and for permanent injunction restraining the Notified Area Council authorities from demolishing the structure.

The plaintiff had constructed a shop without obtaining permission from the Executive Officer, which was in contravention of the provisions of the Odisha Municipal Act. The Executive Officer held that the plaintiff had constructed the shop illegally and was directed to demolish the structure. The plaintiff appealed against this decision, arguing that the notice issued by the Notified Area Council was invalid and that the Civil Court had jurisdiction to examine cases where provisions of the Act had not been complied with, or the statutory tribunal had not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.

The court held that the Civil Court did indeed have jurisdiction to examine cases where provisions of the Act had not been complied with, or the statutory tribunal had not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure. However, in this case, the plaintiff had constructed the shop without obtaining permission from the Executive Officer, which was in contravention of the provisions of the Odisha Municipal Act. Therefore, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and upheld the judgment and decree passed by the lower courts.

The court order also states that when a notification is issued under Sub-sec.(a) of Sec.5 of the Odisha Municipal Act, including an area in the municipality, all the provisions of this Act and of the rules, bye-laws, notifications or orders made thereunder which, immediately before such inclusion were in force throughout such Municipal area shall be deemed to apply to such area unless it is otherwise directed in and by the said notification.

The court held that the Civil Court had jurisdiction to examine cases where provisions of the Act had not been complied with, or the statutory tribunal had not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure. However, in this case, the plaintiff had constructed the shop illegally, and therefore, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and upheld the judgment and decree passed by the lower courts.
