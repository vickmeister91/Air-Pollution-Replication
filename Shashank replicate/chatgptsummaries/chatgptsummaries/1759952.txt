The court order pertains to a case filed by parents and relatives of 26 students who lost their lives in the collapse of a school building during an earthquake in Gujarat, India. The appellants, who were the defendants in the case, were accused of constructing the building with poor quality materials and without obtaining the necessary permissions. The Trial Court found the appellants guilty of negligence and partly allowed the suits, awarding compensation to the plaintiffs. The High Court upheld the Trial Court's decision and ordered the appellants to pay compensation to the claimants.

The court has ordered the defendants to pay compensation to the claimants for the collapse of a school building during an earthquake. The court has applied principles from previous judgments to determine the compensation amount, which is Rs. 2,00,000/- per student. The defendants have argued that they are not liable for the collapse as it was due to an Act of God, and they were not negligent in the construction of the building. The court has referred to previous cases to determine the liability of enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industries.

The court order establishes a new principle of liability for hazardous or inherently dangerous industries, stating that enterprises engaged in such activities owe an absolute and non-delegable duty to ensure the safety of those working in and living around the factory. The enterprise must be held strictly liable for any harm caused by the hazardous activity, regardless of whether it took reasonable care or not. The court also discusses the essential components of negligence and the principle of res ipsa loquitur. Finally, the court notes that while an earthquake is an Act of God, the duty of taking reasonable care in construction is distinct and separate from the natural calamity.

The court order states that the duty of taking reasonable care in the construction of a school building is vested upon the appellants and is distinct and separate from the natural calamity, in the form of an earthquake, that took place. The court found that there was a failure on the part of the appellants to exercise due care expected of a reasonable and prudent man, and there was a failure to comply with all statutory requirements in constructing the building. The court found the appellants liable to pay compensation and damages to the plaintiffs. The court also discussed the quantum of compensation to be awarded in case of children.

The court order discusses the determination of compensation for the death of children in a fire at a school. The court cites previous cases and principles, including the expectation of pecuniary benefit and the potential future earnings of the children. The court determines that the compensation for children between the ages of 5 to 10 should be three times the original amount, and for children between the ages of 10 to 15, the appropriate multiplier should be 15. The court also considers the notional income of the children and awards compensation accordingly. The court orders the appellants to pay a total amount of Rs. 3,75,000/- with interest at the rate of 8% per annum to each claimant. The judgment and decree of the Trial Court are modified accordingly.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where the defendants were accused of constructing a school building with poor quality materials and without obtaining the necessary permissions, which resulted in the death of 26 students during an earthquake. The court found the defendants guilty of negligence and ordered them to pay compensation to the claimants.
