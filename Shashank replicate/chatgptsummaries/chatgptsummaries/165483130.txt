The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to inspect and ensure that construction on land covered by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011 was as per plans sanctioned by the MCGM prior to 4.1.2002. The NGT has also directed the MCGM to remove any unauthorized structures that were constructed after 4.1.2002 without prior recommendation from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).

The NGT has further directed the MCGM to constitute a team to inspect the site and take appropriate legal action under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act to remove any unauthorized structures. The MCGM has been ordered to file a detailed affidavit explaining its stand and the Municipal Commissioner has been directed to be present before the Tribunal on the next date.

However, the Division Bench has stayed the operation of the order requiring the Commissioner's presence. The petition was disposed of requiring MCGM to file the necessary affidavit, if not already filed before the Tribunal.

The NGT's order is significant as it seeks to ensure that construction in the CRZ area is carried out in accordance with the law and that unauthorized structures are removed. The CRZ Notification, 2011 was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to regulate activities in the coastal zone and to protect the coastal environment.

The notification divides the coastal zone into four categories - CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III and CRZ-IV. CRZ-I areas are ecologically sensitive and are subject to strict regulation, while CRZ-II areas are designated as urban areas and are subject to certain restrictions. CRZ-III areas are rural and undeveloped areas, while CRZ-IV areas are designated as water areas.

The NGT's order is particularly relevant to CRZ-II areas, which are urban areas that are subject to certain restrictions. The order seeks to ensure that construction in these areas is carried out in accordance with the law and that unauthorized structures are removed.

The NGT's order is also significant as it seeks to ensure that the MCGM takes appropriate legal action under the MRTP Act to remove any unauthorized structures. The MRTP Act is a key piece of legislation that regulates land use and development in Maharashtra. The Act provides for the preparation of development plans, the regulation of land use, the control of development and the acquisition of land for public purposes.

The NGT's order is likely to have a significant impact on the MCGM's approach to regulating construction in the CRZ area. The order seeks to ensure that the MCGM takes a proactive approach to regulating construction and that unauthorized structures are removed.

In conclusion, the NGT's order is a significant step towards ensuring that construction in the CRZ area is carried out in accordance with the law and that unauthorized structures are removed. The order seeks to ensure that the MCGM takes appropriate legal action under the MRTP Act to remove any unauthorized structures and that a proactive approach is taken to regulating construction in the CRZ area. The order is likely to have a significant impact on the MCGM's approach to regulating construction in the CRZ area and is a positive step towards protecting the coastal environment.
