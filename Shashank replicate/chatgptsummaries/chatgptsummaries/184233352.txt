The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) challenging an order passed by the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) in criminal revision No. 10/17. The order in question affirmed an earlier order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Rampur, Naikin, District-Sidhi in Crime No. 351/2017. The petitioner claimed that he is the registered owner of a tractor bearing No. 35 DI Model with registration No. MP-53/AA-6930, which was seized for illegal transport of sand.

The petitioner sought relief from the court, claiming that the order passed by the 2nd ASJ was erroneous and that the tractor should be returned to him. The court allowed the application and ordered that the truck be delivered to the petitioner on Supurdnama subject to certain conditions.

The case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with cases of illegal transport of sand. It also underscores the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights and to seek legal recourse when necessary.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the law must be followed and that individuals must be held accountable for their actions. It also highlights the importance of seeking legal counsel when dealing with legal matters, as this can help to ensure that one's rights are protected and that justice is served.
