The court recently issued two orders pertaining to the installation of bore-wells for agricultural purposes. In the first case, the petitioner had applied for permission to re-bore a bore-well on his agricultural land, which was rejected by the District Level Advisory Committee. The petitioner claimed that the report relied upon by the Committee was factually incorrect and that applications filed by some other persons had been allowed. However, the court held that it cannot go into disputed questions of facts and that the petitioner can approach a civil court to verify the correct factual position. The court also cited the directions issued by the Government of NCT of Delhi under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 with respect to grant of permission for bore-wells.

The second case involved a petitioner who had sought permission for re-boring of a tube well for agricultural purposes, but the Competent Authority refused to grant permission as it found that the site was not being used for agricultural purposes. The court found no merit in the petitioner's case and dismissed the petition. 

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of following the guidelines and regulations set forth by the government with respect to the installation of bore-wells for agricultural purposes. The court noted that permission for borewell installation for agricultural purposes can be granted to genuine agriculturists based on recommendations from the Block Development Officer and Agriculture Department/Irrigation & Floor Control Department. The permission will be granted by the Advisory Committee under the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Revenue).

The court's orders highlight the need for proper documentation and adherence to regulations when seeking permission for bore-well installation for agricultural purposes. The court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's case in the second order underscores the importance of using the land for agricultural purposes in order to be eligible for permission to install a bore-well. 

Overall, the court's orders serve as a reminder to individuals seeking permission for bore-well installation for agricultural purposes to carefully follow the guidelines and regulations set forth by the government and to ensure that their land is being used for agricultural purposes. Failure to do so may result in the denial of permission to install a bore-well.
