The Bombay High Court recently heard and decided on four petitions challenging an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, 62nd Court, Dadar, Mumbai, issuing process under various sections of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, 2000. The petitioners, who were accused, challenged the order on the grounds of environmental clearance and an increase in vehicular traffic leading to air and noise pollution. The complainant relied on studies conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and noise monitoring conducted by the accused. The court reserved its judgment on February 13, 2019, and pronounced it on May 2, 2019.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed against several parties for violating noise and air pollution regulations in BSWL. The complainant relied on studies conducted by NEERI and noise monitoring conducted by one of the accused parties. The court found that the accused parties had not complied with an order passed by the NGT and had violated several sections of the Environment Protection Rules and Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules. The court issued process against accused parties 1-5, 10-15, 19-22. The accused parties filed writ petitions challenging the order.

The court order discusses arguments made by various parties regarding the applicability of certain sections and rules related to noise pollution control, as well as the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and the sufficiency of notice given under the Environment (Protection) Act. The complainant cites orders and directions given by the National Green Tribunal and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board regarding compliance with pollution standards. The court must determine whether the accused parties have committed any offenses under the relevant laws and rules.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has directed the Traffic Commissioner to check the pollution levels of vehicles on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link for compliance with BS-IV standards. The complainant alleges that the Traffic Department has not taken sufficient measures to control pollution and noise pollution caused by the sea link. The accused have failed to comply with relevant provisions of environmental protection rules and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The court is considering whether the complainant has followed the correct procedure for lodging a complaint under the Act.

The court order discusses the sections of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and relevant rules that pertain to the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution. The accused, who are officers, have been issued directions regarding controlling air and noise pollution. The court analyzes the sections under which the learned Magistrate has issued process and concludes that the accused, who are not involved in any kind of manufacturing, industry, and operation, are not responsible for any emission of environmental pollution. The court also discusses the penalties for contravention of the provisions of the act and the rules, orders, and directions issued thereunder.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Environment Protection Act and Rules, as well as the Noise Pollution Regulation and Control Rules. It clarifies that certain sections and rules do not apply to the issue of heavy vehicular traffic, which is not considered an industry, process, or operation. The complaint filed against various individuals and entities is also discussed, with some being dropped from the case. The court emphasizes the importance of government officers fulfilling their duties to maintain ecological balance and prevent pollution.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal in penalizing those who violate environmental laws. The court notes that while the Tribunal has the power to impose penalties for non-compliance with its orders, it cannot try or punish accused persons found guilty under the Environmental Protection Act. The court also refers to an order by the National Green Tribunal directing the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to prescribe noise standards for the use of sirens and multi-toned horns, and notes that the Tribunal has the power to hold authorities in contempt and prosecute them for non-compliance with its orders.

The court order discusses the use of inherent powers by the High Court to quash and set aside criminal proceedings. The court cites various judgments to establish the criteria for issuing process and the need for the magistrate to consider the complaint and other documents relied upon by the complainant. The court also notes that the High Court has supervisory powers to stop the abuse of powers and unnecessary criminal litigations when no specific offense is made out. The court examines the allegations made against the Nevatia group and finds them to be vague and unsupported by evidence. The court notes that the authorities have taken steps to comply with the orders of the National Green Tribunal and that if there is air or noise pollution, it should be controlled.

The court order states that documents and communication are part of the complaint regarding air and noise pollution. The accused parties have taken steps to comply with the National Green Tribunal's order, but the complainant suggests that stricter monitoring of PUC and honking is necessary. The court finds that the petitioners were not parties in the National Green Tribunal's application and there is no material to issue process against them. The order of issuance of process is set aside and quashed for the petitioners only. The court appreciates the complainant's efforts to fight against air and noise pollution. The writ petitions are allowed and the criminal applications are disposed of accordingly.

In conclusion, the court order discusses various aspects of environmental protection laws and regulations, including noise and air pollution
