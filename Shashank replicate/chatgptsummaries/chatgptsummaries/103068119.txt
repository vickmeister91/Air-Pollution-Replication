The court order in question pertains to a case involving M/s Bhola Motor Garage, which was convicted under Section 44 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The conviction was based on the fact that the garage had been using water for servicing vehicles without obtaining the necessary permission from the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner, who was the owner of the garage, challenged the conviction and appealed to the Addl. Sessions Judge in Ludhiana. However, the appeal was dismissed, and the petitioner subsequently filed a revision petition before the Punjab-Haryana High Court.

The petitioner's main argument in the revision petition was that the sentence already undergone by him was excessive and should be reduced. The court accepted this submission made by the petitioner's counsel and reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by the petitioner. This means that the petitioner will not have to serve any additional time in jail for the offense.

In addition to reducing the sentence, the court also ordered that if the petitioner intends to continue operating the motor garage, he must obtain the necessary permission from the Pollution Control Board. This is an important condition, as it ensures that the garage will not continue to violate environmental regulations in the future.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with environmental regulations. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is a crucial piece of legislation that is designed to protect our water resources from pollution. By enforcing this law, the court has sent a strong message that environmental violations will not be tolerated. At the same time, the court's decision to reduce the petitioner's sentence shows that it is willing to consider mitigating factors and take a balanced approach to sentencing.
