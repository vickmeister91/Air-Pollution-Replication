The Uttarakhand High Court recently heard a public interest petition filed by a lawyer concerned about violations of environmental laws by private respondents and violations of court orders for the protection of "bugyals" in Uttarakhand. The petitioner argued that a mega wedding event organized by the Gupta family at Auli, a remote mountain resort known for skiing in winters, would cause irreparable damage to the fragile ecosystem of the "bugyal". The court did not stop the wedding but issued orders for the preservation of the environment and eco-balance at Auli and its vicinity. The court also directed an inquiry into the decision-making process for granting approval and permission for the wedding and ordered the private respondents to deposit at least 200 crores for the protection of the environment.

The court order pertains to a wedding that took place in Auli, Uttarakhand, India, in June 2019. The court did not stay the wedding but raised concerns about the environmental impact of such events on the fragile ecosystem of the upper Himalayas. The court directed the organizers to deposit an amount of Rs. 3,00,00,000/- (Rupees Three Crores only) and imposed restrictions on the use of helipads and other activities. The court also directed the State Pollution Control Board to apprise the court of the pollution caused by the event. The court received a report on the waste generated by the event and directed the return of an amount of Rs. 2,50,00,000/- (Rupees Two Crore Fifty Lakh only) to the organizers. The court raised concerns about the impact of such events on the Alpine meadows or Bugyals in the region and the need to protect them.

The court order discusses the importance of Bugyals, which are alpine meadows in the Uttarakhand region of India. These meadows are important for the local inhabitants, who use them for grazing and religious purposes, as well as for the biodiversity resources they provide, including medicinal and aromatic plants. The court order cites previous orders that have protected Bugyals as ecosystems and prohibited tourist activities that would harm them. The court expresses concern over the degradation of Bugyals due to overuse and commercialization, and directs authorities to take remedial measures to protect them.

The court ordered the removal of all permanent structures from alpine meadows/sub-alpine meadows/Bugyals in the State of Uttarakhand, constituted Eco-Development Committees to protect and preserve nature, environment and ecology, restricted the number of tourists visiting the alpine meadows/sub-alpine meadows/Bugyals, banned the construction of any permanent structure on the alpine meadows/sub-alpine meadows/Bugyals, banned overnight stay in the Alpine meadows/Sub-alpine meadows/Bugyals, and banned commercial grazing of cattle on alpine meadows/sub-alpine meadows/Bugyals. The court requested institutes to submit reports on whether "Auli" is a "Bugyal" and two institutes submitted reports stating that it is not a "Bugyal". The petitioner claimed that "Auli" is being polluted and ecologically threatened by holding events such as the marriage ceremony, but the private respondents denied this claim.

The court order discusses the status of Auli as a "Bugyal" or Alpine Meadow. The report concludes that Auli does not fall under this category and instead can be categorized as a forest blank. The court notes that Auli is in close proximity to environmentally sensitive areas and is a rich reserve of biological resources, particularly medicinal and aromatic plants. The court emphasizes the need to protect and conserve these resources and cites India's commitment to the United Nations' convention on biological diversity. The court concludes that Auli cannot be viewed as an exotic tourist destination and requires conservation measures.

The court order discusses the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, which mandates the Central Government to develop national strategies, plans, and programs for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The Act also enables the State Government to declare areas of biodiversity importance as biodiversity heritage sites. The court notes that no site has yet been declared as a Biodiversity heritage site in Uttarakhand. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting and improving the environment and safeguarding forests and wildlife, which is a fundamental duty of every citizen. The court also acknowledges the role of courts in ascertaining facts and ensuring the implementation of anti-pollution laws.

The court order discusses the issue of holding a large event in an eco-sensitive area in Uttarakhand, India. The court finds that the state government should not have given permission for the event and that there is a need to balance tourism with environmental protection. The court orders the government to constitute an expert committee to identify biodiversity heritage sites and determine the carrying capacity of tourist destinations in biodiversity-sensitive zones. The court also orders the remaining amount of money deposited by the event organizers to be used for repairing damages caused and returned to the organizers if there are no further deductions. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable tourism and limiting activities in eco-sensitive areas to sports and adventure tourism.

The court order directs the government of Uttarakhand to focus on sustainable tourism and prohibits large events in the destination of Auli. The petition has been disposed of and a copy of the order will be sent to the Secretary of Tourism and the Secretary of Forest for compliance. The Registrar General of the Court has been directed to take necessary action.
