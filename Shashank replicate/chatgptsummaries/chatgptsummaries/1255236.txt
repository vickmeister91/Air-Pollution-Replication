The court orders discussed in this summary all involve disputes over land and religious significance. In the first case, a small strip of land behind the Shahi Jama Masjid mosque in Merta City was claimed by the mosque's managing committee, who had leased it out to tenants. However, Hindus from Merta City claimed that the land had religious significance for them and had installed stone slabs with inscriptions and images on it. The court found that the plaintiffs were in possession of the land and entitled to mesne profits, but also found that two of the stone slabs had been there for over 33 years and had religious significance for the defendants. The court allowed the defendants to worship the slabs after the shops on the land were closed, but ordered the removal of the other four slabs. The plaintiffs appealed the decision, arguing that there was no evidence that the slabs were being worshipped, but the court upheld the decision.

In the second case, objections were raised by the parties in a dispute over a piece of land claimed by a mosque. The court addressed objections related to the maintenance of the suit, notice to the Waqf Board and Devasthan Commissioner, and the constitution of the appeal. The court also considered arguments related to the evidence presented in the case, including the worship of idols and the installation of 'Devlis'. Ultimately, the court overruled most of the objections and upheld the decision of the lower court.

The third case involved a dispute over land and the presence of stone slabs called "Devlis" on the land. The court ruled that the defendants who were not originally named in the suit could still be added to the appeal, and that the government and municipal board were not necessary parties to the suit. The court also examined the ownership and possession of the land, the significance of the Devlis, and whether the defendants had a right to worship them. The court found that the plaintiffs were in possession of the land and that two of the Devlis had been in existence for a long time, but four others were introduced later. The court also discussed the religious significance of the Devlis and the variance between the pleadings and proof regarding the defendants' right to worship them.

In the fourth case, a dispute arose over the use of land containing religious idols and a mosque. The court ruled that the status quo from before 1956 should be maintained, and no new changes should be allowed. The plaintiffs were entitled to mesne profits, and the defendants were ordered to remove four of the six idols and not visit them during shopping hours. The defendants were also left to decide which idols to remove. The court refused to grant leave to appeal.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complexities of disputes involving land and religious significance. The courts must carefully consider the evidence presented and balance the rights of different parties, including those with religious beliefs. In some cases, compromises must be made to allow for the peaceful coexistence of different religious groups.
