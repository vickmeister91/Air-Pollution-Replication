The court order in question pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and two Special Civil Applications. The matter at hand concerns the issue of pollution control, and the court finds that both the Central and State Governments have a vital role to play in the formulation of policies related to this matter. As such, the court directs the petitioner to join the State and Central Governments as parties to the proceedings.

The court has set a date of 29th January 2014 for the matters to appear, and has permitted direct service. Additionally, the court has clarified that the pendency of these applications will not stand in the way of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) in making efforts to resolve the dispute jointly.

The court's decision to involve the State and Central Governments in the proceedings is significant, as it highlights the importance of a collaborative approach to addressing issues related to pollution control. By bringing all relevant parties to the table, the court is ensuring that the best possible policies are formulated and implemented.

Furthermore, the court's decision to permit direct service is a practical one, as it will help to expedite the proceedings and ensure that all parties are kept informed of any developments. This is particularly important in a matter as urgent as pollution control, where delays can have serious consequences for public health and the environment.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision to allow the CPCB and GPCB to continue their efforts to resolve the dispute jointly is a positive step. By encouraging collaboration between these two bodies, the court is promoting a more coordinated and effective approach to pollution control.

Overall, the court's order in this matter is a clear indication of the importance of addressing issues related to pollution control in a collaborative and proactive manner. By involving all relevant parties and allowing for direct service, the court is ensuring that the best possible policies are formulated and implemented, and that the public's health and the environment are protected.
