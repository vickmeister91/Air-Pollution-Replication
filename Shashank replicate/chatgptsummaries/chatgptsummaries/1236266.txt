The first court order involves a dispute between the Municipal Corporation of Ludhiana and Inderjit Singh over the demolition of a property owned by Hira Devi. The appellant claimed that a part of the construction was unauthorized and issued notices to show cause, but the respondent failed to respond. A suit was filed for permanent injunction, but the appellant issued a demolition order. An appeal was filed and the District Judge ordered the restoration of the construction. The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant, stating that the notices were issued against a dead person, the property description was vague, and no opportunity of hearing was given to the respondent. The court also found that the appellant acted illegally and without jurisdiction in demolishing the structures.

The second court order pertains to the demolition of a building that was constructed without proper sanction or in contravention of the law. The commissioner has the power to order the demolition of such a building, but only after giving the person responsible a reasonable opportunity to show cause. Any person aggrieved by such an order can appeal to the Court of the District Judge. The court found that the notice for demolition was vague and did not comply with the mandatory legal provisions. The appellant was directed to restore the constructions for which the order of sanction had been obtained. The appeal was dismissed subject to modifications, and the appellant was ordered to pay the costs of the respondent.
