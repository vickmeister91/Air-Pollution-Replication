The Jharkhand High Court recently issued a court order regarding a writ application against an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chaibasa in Misc. Case No. 18 of 2006. The order was for the confiscation of trucks belonging to the petitioners, Avatar Singh and Mohinder Singh, who were transporting iron ore illegally. The court found that the documents presented by the prosecution were not verified and therefore could not be conclusively deemed as forged. The court also noted that the petitioners did not commit any offense under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The court ordered the release of the confiscated trucks.
