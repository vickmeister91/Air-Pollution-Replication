The court order pertains to the conviction of Murari Lal Chaudhary for the murder of Jag Narain in 2003. The court found that the appellant was present in the room where the deceased was found murdered and that he was seen washing clothes soon after the sound of a blunt object being banged coming from the room. The court also found that the chain of circumstances was complete wherefrom the guilt of the appellant could be inferred. However, the court noted that the alleged motive for the crime had fallen and that the topology of the place of crime showed the building to be densely inhabited, making it possible for an outsider to enter and commit the crime. The court applied the principles of circumstantial evidence to arrive at its decision.

The court order states that in order to prove the guilt of the accused, four principles of circumstantial evidence must be fulfilled, including the exclusion of every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved. However, in this case, these principles have not been established, and the evidence does not rule out the possibility of an outsider committing the crime. The court reminds the legal fraternity of their duty to raise their level of legal acumen, especially when the accused is a poor man. The accused had informed the counsel of his workplace, which could have provided evidence of his innocence, but the defense did not take any steps to summon the employer or cross-examine the investigating officer. As a result, the appeal is allowed, the accused is acquitted, and directions are issued for his release.
