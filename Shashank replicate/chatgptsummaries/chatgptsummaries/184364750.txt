In the first court order, Deepak Kumar was accused of hitting Sanjay Kumar with a cricket bat, causing injuries to him. The prosecution presented twelve witnesses, including Sanjay Kumar, who testified that Deepak had hit him with the bat. The court found a prima facie case against Deepak and charged him with the offense under Section 308 IPC. The court heard the arguments on March 30, 2012, and delivered the judgment on April 17, 2012. The court found Deepak guilty of the offense and sentenced him accordingly.

In the second court order, the accused was found guilty of causing injuries to Sanjay with a cricket bat and convicted under Section 323 IPC.

The medical evidence was not complete, and the court found that the injuries did not amount to a grievous injury under Section 320 IPC. The court sentenced the accused to the period of detention already undergone during the investigation and trial of the case.

Unfortunately, the third court order was not provided, so it cannot be summarized.
