The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Hasib Beg, who has been accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. According to the prosecution, Beg was found cooking the flesh of Chinkara with skin in his factory, and various items were seized from his possession. Beg's counsel, on the other hand, argues that he has been falsely implicated due to political enmity, and that he is entitled to bail since the investigation has been completed and the offence is triable by a magistrate.

After hearing both sides, the court grants bail to Beg on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount, and complies with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. This means that Beg will have to provide a sum of money as security to ensure that he appears in court when required, and that he will have to follow certain conditions set by the court in order to remain out on bail.

The decision to grant bail to Beg is based on several factors. Firstly, the court has taken into account the fact that the investigation into the alleged offence has been completed, which means that there is no risk of Beg interfering with the investigation or tampering with evidence. Secondly, the offence in question is triable by a magistrate, which means that it is not a serious offence that would warrant denying bail. Finally, Beg has argued that he has been falsely implicated due to political enmity, and the court has taken this into account as well.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that Beg has been acquitted of the charges against him. He will still have to face trial and prove his innocence in court. However, the decision to grant bail does give him some relief from the harsh conditions of imprisonment, and allows him to prepare his defence while out on bail.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Hasib Beg is based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the relevant legal provisions. While the decision may be controversial, it is ultimately up to the court to decide whether or not to grant bail in a particular case, based on the evidence and arguments presented before it.
