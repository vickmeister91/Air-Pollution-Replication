The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing an order passed by the II Additional Sessions Judge, Sehore in S.T.No.35/2015. The order rejected the applicant-accused's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for direction to supply copies of the statement of witnesses taken during the marg enquiry.

The court found that the statement of witnesses recorded during the marg enquiry had not been supplied to the accused persons, which is required for a fair trial. The court noted that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India, and any violation of this right would render the trial unfair and unjust.

The court observed that the accused persons have a right to know the evidence against them and to cross-examine the witnesses who have deposed against them. The court further noted that the statement of witnesses recorded during the marg enquiry is an important piece of evidence, and the accused persons have a right to access it.

The court held that the lower court's order rejecting the accused's application for direction to supply copies of the statement of witnesses was erroneous and against the principles of natural justice. The court found that the impugned order was set aside, and the lower court was directed to ensure the supply of the copy of the statement to the petitioner.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the right to a fair trial and ensures that the accused persons have access to all the evidence against them. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice in criminal proceedings.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right that must be upheld at all times. The court's decision ensures that the accused persons have access to all the evidence against them, which is essential for a fair trial. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of following the principles of natural justice in criminal proceedings.
