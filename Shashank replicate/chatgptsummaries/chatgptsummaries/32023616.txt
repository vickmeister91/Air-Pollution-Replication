The court order pertains to a case involving the confiscation of an elephant tusk and an unlicensed gun and accessories, as well as a jeep used in the commission of a forest offense. The case was filed by Komarrikkal Elias against an order passed by the District Judge, Wayanad, Kalpetta, regarding the seizure of these items. The Assistant Wild Life Warden, Sulthanbathery, directed for the confiscation of the items seized and the Jeep belonging to Elias. The appellate authority remanded the matter to the authority of first instance, and the learned single Judge of the High Court held that the elephant tusk was not a forest produce and that the presumption was not attracted. The definition of 'forest produce' under Section 2(f) of the 1961 Act was also discussed. Section 61A provides for confiscation by forest officers in certain cases.

The court ruled that the elephant tusk is the property of the government, regardless of whether it is considered a forest produce or not, and therefore subject to confiscation. The jeep, however, was released to the respondent as the offense was almost twenty years old and there was no evidence that it was used in the transportation of the elephant tusk. The appeal was allowed to the extent indicated in the signed order.
