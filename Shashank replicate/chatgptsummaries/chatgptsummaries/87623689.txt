Two court orders have been issued in relation to violations of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The first order pertains to Umar Bashir Dar, who was accused of importing 32 Shahtoosh shawls containing hair of Tibetan antelope, which are banned under Schedule-I of the Act. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau filed a complaint against Dar for violating the Act. The court heard arguments on the point of charge and concluded that there were sufficient grounds to frame a charge against the accused for contravention of the provisions of sections 39, 44, 48A, 49, and 49B of the Act. The court also stated that at the stage of framing of charge, the court has power to shift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against accused has been made out.

The second court order pertains to an accused who was caught with 102 shawls, including 32 suspected shawls, at the IGI Airport in New Delhi. The accused was allegedly carrying the shawls for sale illegally and without authorization. The court found sufficient evidence to frame charges against the accused under various provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, but not under section 9 of the Act as there was no evidence of poaching of Tibetan antelope. The accused pleaded not guilty and the case was adjourned for post-charge evidence.
