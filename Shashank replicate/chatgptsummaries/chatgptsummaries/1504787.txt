In a recent court order, two individuals who were running food stalls in a bird sanctuary located in a reserved forest were given eight weeks to remove their stalls from the area. The court dismissed the petition to quash the notices issued by the authorities objecting to the continuation of the stalls, citing a Supreme Court order that required prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in a forest area.

The petitioners had argued that their stalls were not causing any harm to the environment and were providing a livelihood for them. However, the court held that the Supreme Court order was clear in its requirement for prior approval for any non-forest activity in a forest area, and that the petitioners had not obtained such approval.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not paid the charges for the use of the forest area for their stalls, and ordered them to pay the unpaid charges before removing their stalls. If they fail to do so within the given time frame, the authorities can take appropriate steps for removal and/or demolition of the stalls.

This court order highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in a forest area. It also emphasizes the need to pay charges for the use of forest areas for commercial activities.

The issue of commercial activities in forest areas has been a contentious one in India, with many arguing that such activities are necessary for the livelihoods of local communities. However, the Supreme Court has held that the protection of forests and wildlife is of paramount importance, and that any non-forest activity in a forest area must be subject to prior approval and payment of charges.

In recent years, there have been several cases where commercial activities in forest areas have been challenged in court. In one such case, the Supreme Court ordered the closure of all commercial activities in the core areas of tiger reserves in India, citing the need to protect the habitat of tigers.

The court order in the present case is in line with the Supreme Court's stance on the protection of forests and wildlife. It sends a clear message that any non-forest activity in a forest area must be subject to prior approval and payment of charges, and that failure to comply with these requirements can result in the removal and/or demolition of the activity.

It is important for individuals and businesses to be aware of the legal requirements for commercial activities in forest areas, and to obtain the necessary approvals and pay the required charges. This will not only ensure compliance with the law, but also contribute to the protection of forests and wildlife in India.
