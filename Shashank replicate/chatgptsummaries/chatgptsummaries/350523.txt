The Kerala High Court issued a writ of mandamus to direct the 1st respondent to constitute a committee of experts to study the reasons for the poisonous fog formation in Cochin City and to suggest remedial measures. The court order discusses the issue of air pollution in Cochin, Kerala, and the steps taken by the government to control it. The Kerala Vehicles Rules, 1961, and G.O. (P) 170/86/PW & T, dated 27-1-1986, prescribe standards for checking emission of smoke, vapour, or harmful substances. The government has recommended and approved 35 testing centers throughout the state, and officers of the Motor Vehicles Department and the Police Department are being considered for special training courses to check vehicles.

The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) was directed to investigate the air pollution within the city and surrounding areas and submit a report. The NEERI submitted their final report on 29-8-1990, which contained recommendations for preventing air pollution. The report submitted by NEERI and the Executive Engineer, Air Pollution Control Cell of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, highlights the sources of air pollution caused by industrial plants, motor vehicles, sewers, and domestic drains emanating foul gases. The report also furnishes the ambient air quality study and results of its program.

The court order discusses the findings of a study on air pollution in the Cochin region, which revealed high levels of pollutants such as SPM, volatile matter, ammonia, and trace metals. The report recommends regular monitoring and control measures for industrial areas, as well as the enforcement of emission standards for vehicles. The court criticizes the lack of action by the Cochin Corporation in managing pollution, particularly in regards to the open sewage system. The court also notes the need for a regional comprehensive study to ensure sustainable development and urban growth without ecological problems. The objections raised by the respondents to the study findings are deemed unsustainable.

The court order states that due to the geographical location of Cochin, even a small increase in pollutants can cause serious pollution. Therefore, air pollution must be prohibited to the maximum extent possible. The objections raised by the respondents to the reports of NEERI and the Pollution Control Board are not valid, and their recommendations must be followed to maintain a pollution-free environment. The Central Acts have effective systems of regulation and control, and the industries emitting pollutants must be constantly monitored and evaluated. The Corporation of Cochin and other bodies responsible for containing air pollution must submit yearly reports on the action taken.

The court delayed the execution of the directions passed by the learned single Judge, and ultimately NEERI has filed the final report on 29-8-1990. The court issues several directions to various parties to take immediate steps to prevent pollution, including laying down underground sewage pipes, implementing rules regarding automobile exhaust fumes, and providing green belt barriers between industrial and residential sectors. The Original Petitions are disposed of, and the parties are to bear their respective costs.

The court order cites various sections of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and emphasizes the need to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Air pollution adversely affects human beings and their environment, and the government needs to take more steps to control it. Due to the geographical location of Cochin, even a small increase in pollutants can cause serious pollution. Therefore, air pollution must be prohibited to the maximum extent possible.
