The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed an appeal by Rajinder Krishan Sharma IFS Retd. against the Union of India & Ors. The case involved a review petition filed by Sharma, which was dismissed by the Tribunal on the grounds that the issue raised in his original application had already been dismissed in previous proceedings and that the review application was filed after the expiry of 30 days. The Court found that the land in question was not a forest land and upheld the Tribunal's decision. As a result, the appeal was dismissed.

The case began when Sharma filed an original application before the Tribunal, seeking a declaration that the land in question was not a forest land and that he was entitled to use it for non-forest purposes. The Tribunal dismissed the application, finding that the land was indeed a forest land and that Sharma was not entitled to use it for non-forest purposes. Sharma then filed a review petition before the Tribunal, which was also dismissed on the grounds that the issue had already been decided in the original application and that the review application was filed after the expiry of 30 days.

Sharma then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Tribunal had erred in dismissing his review petition. He contended that the Tribunal had not considered certain documents that he had submitted in support of his case and that the issue of whether the land was a forest land had not been conclusively decided in the original application.

The Supreme Court, however, found no merit in Sharma's arguments. It noted that the Tribunal had considered all the documents submitted by Sharma and had found them to be of no relevance to the issue at hand. The Court also observed that the issue of whether the land was a forest land had been conclusively decided in the original application and that Sharma had not raised any new grounds in his review petition that would warrant a reconsideration of the issue.

The Court further noted that the review application was filed after the expiry of 30 days, which was the time limit prescribed under the law for filing such applications. It held that the Tribunal had rightly dismissed the review petition on this ground.

Finally, the Court considered the question of whether the land in question was a forest land. It observed that the Tribunal had relied on satellite imagery and other evidence to conclude that the land was indeed a forest land. The Court found no reason to interfere with this finding and upheld the Tribunal's decision.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this case reaffirms the importance of following the prescribed procedures and timelines in legal proceedings. It also underscores the need for parties to present all relevant evidence and arguments at the earliest possible stage of the proceedings, as the courts are unlikely to entertain new grounds or evidence at a later stage.
