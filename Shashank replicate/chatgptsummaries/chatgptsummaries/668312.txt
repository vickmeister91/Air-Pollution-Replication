In the first court order, M/s Himalayan Frozen Foods Ltd. had challenged an order passed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board which directed the company to submit a bank guarantee of Rs. 10 lakhs for a period of one year to ensure regular operation and maintenance of its Effluent Treatment Plant. However, the court observed that the issue had become infructuous and academic with the passage of time. As a result, the court directed the competent authority in the Pollution Control Board to pass an appropriate order on the petitioner's application for grant of consent to operate within two weeks. The court also left all other questions raised by the parties in these proceedings to be determined in appropriate proceedings, if an occasion to do so arises.

The second court order lacks context and details, making it impossible to provide a meaningful summary of the order itself. It only includes the name of the Chief Justice and a judge, along with a date of October 20, 2009 and the name "Ravinder."
