The court order pertains to three writ petitions filed by brick kiln owners in Faizabad and Ambedkar Nagar districts of Uttar Pradesh. The first petition filed by 42 brick kiln owners seeks permission to run their brick kilns as they are valid license holders, but are unable to do so due to the non-functioning of committees set up for environmental clearance. The court has directed the State Government to complete the process of constitution of committees within three weeks and to give an opportunity to the petitioners for filing of their applications and processing thereof in terms of the rules and regulations. The court has also directed the respondent No.1 to consider the letter sent by the State Government on 5.2.2016 and take a decision thereon and indicate it to the State Government within three weeks. The question of allowing the operation of brick-kilns would therefore be subject to any further assessment on a response made by the Government of India to the State Government.

The second petition discusses the issue of obtaining Environmental Clearance (EC) for mining minor minerals, including sand and gravel. The Ministry of Mines had suggested simplifying and streamlining procedures for granting ECs to address the problems faced in availability of "Brick Earth" and "Ordinary Earth." The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change amended the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, to delegate the authority of EC up to 5 hectares of individual mining lease of minor minerals to the District Environment Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA) headed by the District Magistrate/ District Collector. The court order questions the delegation of power of exemption and concurrence by the Central Government to the DEIAA and District Expert Appraisal Committee. The Committees were authorized to take a decision on the strength of the material collected, but the issue of the delay in constituting the Committees and the impact on the manufacturing of brick kilns is also raised.

The third petition states that the Committees responsible for granting clearance for brick kiln manufacturing in the districts of Faizabad and Ambedkarnagar were not constituted until April 2016. The petitioners argue that their continuance should be acceptable as the authority responsible for granting exemption and clearance did not exist until March/April 2016. The court directs the respondent to take a decision on the clearance/exemption of the petitioners within three weeks and to facilitate the clearance of stocks already available with the petitioners or to continue their running of the brick kiln for the current season. The court does not address the legal contentions of the issue of the valid constitution and operational aspects of the committees or the issue of concurrence by the Central Government. The writ petition is disposed of with the given directions.

In summary, the court order deals with the issue of brick kiln manufacturing and the environmental clearance required for it. The first petition seeks permission to run brick kilns as the committees responsible for granting clearance were not functioning. The court directs the State Government to complete the process of constitution of committees within three weeks and to give an opportunity to the petitioners for filing of their applications and processing thereof in terms of the rules and regulations. The second petition questions the delegation of power of exemption and concurrence by the Central Government to the DEIAA and District Expert Appraisal Committee. The third petition deals with the delay in constituting the Committees responsible for granting clearance for brick kiln manufacturing. The court directs the respondent to take a decision on the clearance/exemption of the petitioners within three weeks and to facilitate the clearance of stocks already available with the petitioners or to continue their running of the brick kiln for the current season. Overall, the court order aims to streamline the process of obtaining environmental clearance for brick kiln manufacturing while ensuring that the necessary regulations are followed.
