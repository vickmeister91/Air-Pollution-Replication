The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by the General Secretary of the All India Trinamul Congress and General Secretary of All India Trinamul Congress (Youth) challenging a notification issued by the Department of Environment, Government of West Bengal and by West Bengal Pollution Control Board. The notification prohibits political parties from holding public meetings using loudspeakers in open areas before three days of the commencement of the Secondary and Higher Secondary Examination and till such examinations are over.

The petitioners sought a direction from the court to relax the notification and permit the use of loudspeakers in open areas during the daytime and preferably between 10-00 hours and 20-00 hours. The court passed an interim order directing the respondents to permit political parties and candidates who are contesting elections for Assembly in North Bengal except Darjeeling town, to hold public meetings by using loudspeakers/microphones in open ground area subject to statutory rules and regulations governing the subject between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. with effect from 9th April, 2011 till 16th April, 2011.

The matter was kept pending with a direction to the respondents and particularly respondent no.10, to file their respective affidavit-in-opposition by way of response on or before the next date of hearing.

The court's decision to allow the use of loudspeakers during political rallies in North Bengal except Darjeeling town has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision as a victory for free speech and democracy, others have expressed concern over the potential impact on students preparing for exams.

The use of loudspeakers during political rallies has long been a contentious issue in India, with many arguing that it disrupts the peace and quiet of residential areas and can be harmful to public health. However, political parties have defended the use of loudspeakers as an essential tool for reaching out to voters and spreading their message.

The court's decision to allow the use of loudspeakers during political rallies in North Bengal except Darjeeling town is a temporary one, and the matter is still pending before the court. It remains to be seen whether the court will ultimately uphold the notification issued by the Department of Environment, Government of West Bengal and by West Bengal Pollution Control Board, or whether it will strike it down as unconstitutional.

In the meantime, political parties and candidates who are contesting elections for Assembly in North Bengal except Darjeeling town are free to hold public meetings by using loudspeakers/microphones in open ground area subject to statutory rules and regulations governing the subject between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. with effect from 9th April, 2011 till 16th April, 2011.
