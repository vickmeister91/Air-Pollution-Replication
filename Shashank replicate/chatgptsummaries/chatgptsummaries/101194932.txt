The first court order pertains to a complaint made by respondents about unauthorized construction on a plot of land falling within a No Development Zone. The appellant, who was responsible for the construction, opposed the application by raising preliminary objections. The Tribunal analyzed the evidence and found that the structure was constructed after 19th February 1991, and therefore unauthorized. The Tribunal ordered the demolition of the structure and directed the appellant to pay a fine. The appellant filed a review petition, which was dismissed. The appellant then filed an appeal challenging both judgments, but the court found that the Tribunal's findings were not manifestly wrong and upheld the decision.

The second court order deals with the construction of public facilities such as rain shelters, toilets, water supply, roads, and bridges, which may be permitted by the State Government/Union Territory Administration. Reconstruction or alterations of existing authorized buildings are also allowed. However, no construction is permitted within 200 meters from the High Tide Line, except for repairs of existing authorized structures. The court found that the structure in question was not the same as the one that existed on February 19, 1991, and was therefore unauthorized and required to be demolished. The court dismissed the appeal and did not find any substantial question of law or public importance.

The two court orders deal with unauthorized construction and the regulations surrounding construction in certain areas. The first order deals with a specific case where the appellant had constructed a structure in a No Development Zone, which was found to be unauthorized by the Tribunal. The appellant had raised preliminary objections, but the Tribunal analyzed the evidence and found that the structure was constructed after 19th February 1991, and therefore unauthorized. The Tribunal ordered the demolition of the structure and directed the appellant to pay a fine. The appellant filed a review petition, which was dismissed. The appellant then filed an appeal challenging both judgments, but the court found that the Tribunal's findings were not manifestly wrong and upheld the decision.

The second court order deals with the regulations surrounding construction in certain areas. The court order states that construction of public facilities such as rain shelters, toilets, water supply, roads, and bridges may be permitted by the State Government/Union Territory Administration. Reconstruction or alterations of existing authorized buildings are also allowed. However, no construction is permitted within 200 meters from the High Tide Line, except for repairs of existing authorized structures. The court found that the structure in question was not the same as the one that existed on February 19, 1991, and was therefore unauthorized and required to be demolished. The court dismissed the appeal and did not find any substantial question of law or public importance.

Both court orders emphasize the importance of following regulations and obtaining proper authorization before constructing any structure. The first order deals with the consequences of unauthorized construction in a No Development Zone, while the second order outlines the regulations surrounding construction in certain areas. The court orders serve as a reminder to individuals and organizations to follow the rules and regulations set forth by the government to avoid legal consequences.
