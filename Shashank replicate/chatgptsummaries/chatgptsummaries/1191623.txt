The court order in question pertains to a dispute between a purchaser under a mortgage-decree and a lease-holder in possession who was not a party to the mortgage suit. The plaintiff sought possession or, alternatively, for the lease-holder to redeem. The court examined the mortgages involved and the leases granted by the mortgagor after the legal mortgage. 

The court found that the lease-holder was entitled to retain possession without redeeming the plaintiff, as the leases were not shown to have impaired the value or impeded the operation of the mortgage. This decision was based on the fact that the leases did not affect the value of the property or hinder the mortgagee's ability to operate the property. 

The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim as to certain plots and modified the decree accordingly. This means that the plaintiff's claim was not upheld for certain plots of land, and the court made changes to the original decree to reflect this decision. 

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the mortgages involved and the leases granted by the mortgagor. The court took into account the impact of the leases on the value and operation of the mortgage, and made a decision based on this analysis. 

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of thoroughly examining all relevant factors when making a decision in a dispute between a mortgagee and a lease-holder. The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the mortgages and leases involved, and serves as a reminder of the need to consider all relevant factors in such cases.
