The court order pertains to a revision filed by the accused in a forgery case challenging an order passed by the Additional District Judge-cum-chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamarajar District at Srivilliputhur, directing the accused to appear and produce certain documents. The accused argued that the order was passed without jurisdiction and violated Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. The court considered various authorities cited by both parties and held that Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not apply to an accused person. The court set aside the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, but noted that the accused could be directed to appear for obtaining specimen signature or thumb impression.

The court has ruled that the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate is not valid, but the magistrate can still direct the appearance of the accused to obtain a signature or thumb impression. The petitioner has already filed a suit in the civil court regarding the validity of the will, so the complainant can approach the civil court for comparison by an expert. The investigating agency can continue the investigation through other sources, and the verdict should not be mistaken as a clean chit to the accused. The revision is allowed, and no separate order is necessary.
