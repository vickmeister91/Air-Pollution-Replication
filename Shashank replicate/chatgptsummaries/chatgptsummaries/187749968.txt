The Delhi High Court recently issued a common order to dispose of three writ petitions filed by Gaurav Fans, Darbari Lal Kataria, and Adarsh Cable Industries against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The petitioners had challenged the order passed by the Financial Commissioner dismissing their appeals and upholding the order passed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee refusing consent to operate under the provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter back to the Financial Commissioner for a fresh decision, taking into account the letters written by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). The court observed that the Financial Commissioner had not considered the letters written by the DDA and MCD, which were relevant to the matter. The court also noted that the Financial Commissioner had not given any reasons for dismissing the appeals filed by the petitioners.

The court further observed that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had not given any reasons for refusing consent to operate to the petitioners. The court held that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee was required to give reasons for its decision, as per the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had not considered the letters written by the DDA and MCD, which were relevant to the matter.

The court directed the Financial Commissioner to consider the letters written by the DDA and MCD and give reasons for his decision. The court also directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to consider the letters written by the DDA and MCD and give reasons for its decision. The court further directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to pass a fresh order within three months from the date of receipt of the court's order.

In another case, the Delhi High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) challenging an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directing the DDA to pay Rs. 5 crore as environmental compensation for damaging the Yamuna floodplains. The NGT had passed the order in response to a petition filed by environmental activist Manoj Misra, who had alleged that the DDA had destroyed the Yamuna floodplains by constructing a biodiversity park on it.

The DDA had challenged the NGT's order on the grounds that it was not responsible for the damage caused to the Yamuna floodplains. The DDA had also argued that the NGT had not given it an opportunity to present its case before passing the order.

The Delhi High Court, however, rejected the DDA's arguments and upheld the NGT's order. The court observed that the DDA had not denied the allegations made by Manoj Misra and had not presented any evidence to show that it was not responsible for the damage caused to the Yamuna floodplains. The court also noted that the NGT had given the DDA several opportunities to present its case before passing the order.

The court further observed that the NGT had passed the order after considering all the relevant facts and evidence. The court held that the NGT's order was well-reasoned and based on sound principles of law. The court also noted that the DDA had not challenged the findings of the NGT before the court.

In yet another case, the Delhi High Court recently directed the Delhi government to take immediate steps to control air pollution in the city. The court was hearing a petition filed by environmental activist Vikrant Tongad, who had alleged that the Delhi government had failed to take adequate steps to control air pollution in the city.

The court observed that air pollution was a serious problem in Delhi and that the Delhi government had a duty to take immediate steps to control it. The court noted that the Delhi government had taken some steps to control air pollution, but these steps were not adequate.

The court directed the Delhi government to take several measures to control air pollution in the city, including banning the use of diesel generators, imposing a fine on construction sites that do not follow dust control measures, and increasing the number of public transport vehicles. The court also directed the Delhi government to set up a task force to monitor air pollution in the city and take appropriate steps to control it.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court has been actively involved in addressing environmental issues in the city. The court has directed various authorities to take steps to control air and water pollution in the city and has upheld orders passed by the NGT to protect the environment. The court has also emphasized the importance of giving reasons for decisions and considering all relevant facts and evidence before passing orders.
