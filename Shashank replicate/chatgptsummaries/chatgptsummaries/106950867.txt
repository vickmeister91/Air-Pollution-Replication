The court order pertains to the case of Hazi Asfaque Hussain, who has been in custody since July 17, 2015, for an offence punishable under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant's counsel has requested bail on the grounds that the applicant is an old person of 70 years of age with no criminal past and that the case is triable by the Court of JMFC and therefore not so grave.

The court has allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. with some tough conditions and directed that the applicant be released on bail on his furnishing a bond in the sum of Rs. 35,000/- with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court to appear before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Hazi Asfaque Hussain has been charged with various offences under the Act. The applicant's counsel has argued that the case is not so grave and that the applicant should be granted bail. The court has considered the arguments put forth by the applicant's counsel and has allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.

Section 439 of Cr.P.C. deals with the powers of the High Court or Court of Session regarding bail. The section provides that a person who is in custody may be released on bail if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence for which he has been charged.

The court has directed that the applicant be released on bail on his furnishing a bond in the sum of Rs. 35,000/- with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The court has also imposed some tough conditions on the applicant. The applicant has been directed to appear before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of the bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Hazi Asfaque Hussain is a welcome move. The applicant is an old person of 70 years of age with no criminal past. The court has considered these factors while granting bail to the applicant. The court has also taken into account the fact that the case is triable by the Court of JMFC and therefore not so grave.
