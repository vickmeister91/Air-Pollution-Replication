The National Green Tribunal recently heard a case filed by Dr. Udaykumar Vasantrao Jagtap against Saswad Municipal Council and others for causing pollution of water bodies due to untreated sewage and improper Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal practices. The Applicant alleged that the Council was not operating the existing Sewage Treatment Plant and was dumping MSW near a school and junior college, causing health hazards. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board submitted affidavits corroborating the Applicant's claims and issuing directions to the Council to comply with regulations. The CPCB emphasized the need for adequate treatment facilities for sewage and proper management of MSW. The Tribunal ordered the Council to stop water pollution and unscientific disposal of MSW in water bodies.

The court order requires Saswad Municipal Corporation to stop burning municipal solid waste and implement the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000. The council has an old sewage treatment plant that is not in operation and is not treating its sewage or managing its waste in compliance with regulations. The court orders the council to fully commission their MSW plant by March 31, 2015, start phase-wise shifting of waste to the facility after the rainy season, and ensure no nuisance is caused during transportation. The order emphasizes the need for time-bound programs to achieve compliance with environmental regulations.

In addition to the above, the court order requires the Municipal Council and Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran to ensure the use of suitable chemicals and composting to control odors, and to make an oxidation ditch operational within six months to meet discharge norms. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) will monitor compliance and may execute the work if necessary. The Respondent No.1 must pay a cost of Rs.10,000/- to the Applicant. The application is disposed of.
