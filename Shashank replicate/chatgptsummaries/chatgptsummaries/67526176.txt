The court order in question pertains to two Criminal Original Petitions filed by Murugan against The State Represented by The Inspector of Police C.B.I, Chennai. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed in Cr.M.P.Nos.1814 and 1815 of 2018 in C.C. No.2 of 2011 on the file of the learned II Additional District Court for CBI cases, Madurai and to direct the learned II Additional District Court for CBI cases to recall DW 1 to cause the production of loan documents filed and to give evidence on the same in C.C.No.2 of 2011 on the file of the learned II Additional District Court for CBI Cases, Madurai.

The court dismissed the petitions, stating that the accused had failed to elucidate the facts from the witness when he was summoned and that such applications cannot be entertained at the fag end of the trial. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the loan documents from the witness when he was summoned, and that he had only made the request at the end of the trial.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the loan documents were relevant to the case. The court stated that the petitioner had not shown how the loan documents were connected to the charges against him, and that he had not provided any explanation as to why the documents were necessary for his defense.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the witness had deliberately withheld the loan documents. The court stated that the petitioner had not shown any evidence of malice or bad faith on the part of the witness, and that he had not provided any explanation as to why the witness would have withheld the documents.

The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the trial court had erred in not recalling the witness to produce the loan documents. The court noted that the trial court had already given the petitioner an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and that he had failed to elicit any information about the loan documents during the cross-examination.

The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims, and that his applications could not be entertained at the fag end of the trial. The court therefore dismissed the petitions and upheld the order passed by the trial court.
