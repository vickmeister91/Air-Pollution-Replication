The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner, Gurusamy, filed a petition to set aside an order passed by the II-Additional District and Sessions Judge, Thoothukudi, and direct the respondent to comply with an order passed by the I-Additional District and Sessions Judge, Thoothukudi, to supply statements of witnesses sought under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The prosecution had filed a memo stating that the statements had already been converted into a statement recorded under Section 161(3) of Cr.P.C. and supplied to the accused persons.

The court, after hearing both parties, directed the petitioner to approach the trial court by filing an application for non-compliance of the order passed by the I-Additional District and Sessions Judge. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any attempt to approach the trial court and had instead filed the present petition. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any allegations of mala fide against the respondent and that the respondent had complied with the order passed by the I-Additional District and Sessions Judge.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any submissions with regard to the merits of the case and had only sought compliance of the order passed by the I-Additional District and Sessions Judge. The court, therefore, held that the present petition was not maintainable and directed the petitioner to approach the trial court by filing an appropriate application.

The Criminal Original Petition was disposed of, and connected miscellaneous petitions were closed.
