The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Smt. Salma Begam under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petition sought to quash the proceedings of Criminal case no. 1692/09 registered against her for offences punishable under Sections 2 (16-sa) 39 and 48 read with Section 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972. The applicant was found in possession of Chettal, Sambhar and Chinkara skins.

The court observed that the case was registered against the applicant by the Forest Ranger and therefore, the initiation of proceedings against the applicant was in accordance with the law. The court further noted that the possession of the aforementioned animal skins is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or possession of any wild animal or bird specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV of the Act. The Chettal, Sambhar and Chinkara are all listed in Schedule I of the Act.

The court also noted that the possession of the animal skins was not for any scientific or educational purpose, nor was it for any lawful purpose. The possession of the skins was therefore deemed to be illegal. The court further observed that the applicant had not been able to provide any evidence to show that the possession of the skins was lawful.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the applicant. The court held that the proceedings against the applicant were in accordance with the law and that the possession of the animal skins was illegal. The court also noted that the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 was enacted to protect the wildlife in the country and that it was the duty of every citizen to abide by the provisions of the Act.
