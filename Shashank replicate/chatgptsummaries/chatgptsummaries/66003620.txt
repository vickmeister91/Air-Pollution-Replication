The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by P. Sundararajan against the Union of India, represented by the Secretary to Government, Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. The petitioner sought a declaration that Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is null and void. However, the Assistant Solicitor General produced a petition filed before the Supreme Court in which a similar prayer had been made. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, and it was dismissed as withdrawn with no costs.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted by the Indian Parliament to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. Section 22 of the Act deals with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and provides that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any appeal or application against any decision or order of the Tribunal.

The petitioner, P. Sundararajan, challenged the validity of Section 22 of the Act on the ground that it violates the fundamental right to access to justice guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner argued that the provision takes away the jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain any appeal or application against the decisions or orders of the Tribunal, which is a violation of the right to access to justice.

The Assistant Solicitor General, representing the Union of India, produced a petition filed before the Supreme Court in which a similar prayer had been made. The Supreme Court had already issued notice in that petition and the matter was pending before it. The Assistant Solicitor General argued that the writ petition filed by P. Sundararajan was not maintainable as the same relief had already been sought before the Supreme Court.

The petitioner, P. Sundararajan, sought to withdraw the writ petition in view of the submission made by the Assistant Solicitor General. The court allowed the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition and dismissed it as withdrawn with no costs.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 in the context of environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the establishment of a specialized tribunal to deal with environmental disputes and ensures the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection.

The court order also underscores the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to environmental protection and conservation. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is an important step in this direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that environmental concerns are given due consideration in all spheres of decision-making.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by P. Sundararajan challenging the validity of Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The petitioner sought a declaration that the provision is null and void on the ground that it violates the fundamental right to access to justice guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. However, the Assistant Solicitor General produced a petition filed before the Supreme Court in which a similar prayer had been made. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, and it was dismissed as withdrawn with no costs. The court order highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 in the context of environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources and underscores the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to environmental protection and conservation.
