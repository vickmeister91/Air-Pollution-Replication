In the first court order, a criminal revision petition was filed against an order summoning East West Linkers and its proprietor, Preet Singh, to face trial for violating the Environment Protection Act. The petitioners argued that Preet Singh cannot be held criminally liable as she is not the managing director and that the trial court overlooked the fact that no notice was served on the state board or the government. The complainant argued that the plaintiff's remedy was to file a complaint before the court of magistrate. The court ultimately decided to set aside the order summoning the petitioners to face trial.

Moving on to the second court order, it pertains to a complaint filed under the Environment Protection Act and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The defendant had been using more power than permitted under their license and had not availed of an alternative plot offered for relocation. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with charges against the defendant for violating the Environment Protection Act. The court also referred to an office order issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Board regarding the closure of units operating in non-conforming/residential areas of Delhi. The complaint had been filed after giving the required notice, and the court found that the complainant had sufficient grounds to file the complaint.

Lastly, the third court order pertains to a case where the accused were allegedly carrying out illegal industrial activity and violating the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court found that the license being relied upon by the accused was not valid and that the disputed questions of fact could only be determined by the trial court after recording evidence. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the accused to face trial for the offense punishable under Section 3 and 15 of the Environment Protection Act.

In all three court orders, the Environment Protection Act is the common thread. The act is a legislation enacted by the Indian government in 1986 with the objective of providing protection and improvement of the environment. It is a comprehensive legislation that covers a wide range of environmental issues, including air and water pollution, hazardous waste management, and conservation of natural resources.
