The Delhi High Court recently heard three writ petitions from Regent Automobiles, Multan Automobile Engineers, and Flying Fashions, who claimed to be aggrieved by directions issued by the Joint Commissioner of Industries requiring them to furnish bank guarantees for specified amounts. The petitioners contended that the directions were without legal authority and based on vague premises. The respondents argued that the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act, 2000, empowered them to issue such directions. The court ultimately found that the controversy between the parties pertained to the impugned directions requiring the petitioners to furnish bank guarantees for various determined amounts.

The court order pertains to the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act and outlines several conditions that must be met by the occupier of an industrial estate, including the payment of O&M charges, maintaining hygienic working conditions, proper storage of sludge, and filing quarterly returns. The order also requires a bank guarantee of Rs. 5,00,000 to be executed by the occupier as a guarantee of compliance. The court discusses the Act's provisions and concludes that the authorities have the power to issue directions, including the power to require bank guarantees. Rule 10 of the Delhi Common Effluent Treatments Plants Rules, 2001 is also cited, which specifies the nature of directions and the time within which they must be complied with.

The court order states that any industry, operation, or process must be regulated and directed by an officer or authority. The occupier of the premises must also be informed of the direction and given the opportunity to file objections. However, if the occupier has already been heard and the decision has been made, they will not be given another opportunity to be heard. The power to issue directions includes the power to regulate the industry or unit, and the court cannot limit the options available to statutory authorities to ensure compliance with the provisions. 

The court also states that the authorities must show how and why the action of requiring bank guarantees was necessary. The show cause notices issued in each case were stereotypical and did not reflect the infraction of standards or directions that needed to be remedied. The impugned orders cannot be sustained and are quashed.

The Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act, 2000, is a legislation that regulates the discharge of effluent from industrial units. The Act provides for the establishment of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) to treat the effluent discharged by the industrial units. The Act also provides for the constitution of a Central Monitoring Committee to monitor the functioning of the CETPs and to take necessary steps for their improvement.

The Act empowers the authorities to issue directions to the occupiers of the industrial units to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides for the imposition of penalties for non-compliance with the directions issued by the authorities. The Act further provides for the establishment of a fund to be utilized for the improvement of the CETPs.

The court order emphasizes the importance of compliance with the provisions of the Act and the directions issued by the authorities. The court notes that the authorities have the power to issue directions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act, and that the occupiers of the industrial units must comply with these directions. The court also notes that the authorities must show how and why the action of requiring bank guarantees was necessary, and that the show cause notices issued in each case were stereotypical and did not reflect the infraction of standards or directions that needed to be remedied.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's recent order emphasizes the importance of compliance with the provisions of the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act, 2000, and the directions issued by the authorities. The court notes that the authorities have the power to issue directions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act, and that the occupiers of the industrial units must comply with these directions. The court also notes that the authorities must show how and why the action of requiring bank guarantees was necessary, and that the show cause notices issued in each case were stereotypical and did not reflect the infraction of standards or directions that needed to be remedied.
