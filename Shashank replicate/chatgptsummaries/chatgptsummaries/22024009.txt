Phulsingh Gada, a resident of a forest village, filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for his release in connection with a forest crime case. The prosecution alleged that Gada and other accused persons entered the reserve forest area, disturbed the wild habitat, cut trees, and caused damage to public property worth Rs. 20,07,500/-. However, Gada's counsel argued that he has not caused any loss or damage to the forest.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed Gada's bail application. The court directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety for his appearance in court. This decision was made after considering the fact that Gada is a resident of a forest village and has no prior criminal record.
