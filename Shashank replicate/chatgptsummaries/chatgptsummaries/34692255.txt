The Indian judiciary has been actively involved in environmental protection and conservation. In recent years, several court orders have been passed to ensure that environmental laws are enforced and violators are held accountable. This article summarizes three court orders related to environmental clearance and the applicability of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification.

The first court order pertains to an appeal against a previous judgment in a writ petition filed by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. The company had sought clarification on the applicability of the EIA Notification dated 14th September 2006. The Haryana State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority was taking the view that prior environmental clearance was necessary even for projects and activities not enumerated in the Schedule to the EIA Notification. The court found that the EIA Notification applies to all projects in excess of 20,000 sq. mtrs., irrespective of the nature of the project or activity. The court also held that the respondent no.1 could not be said to have acted with mala fide intent in not applying for prior environmental clearance. This order reinforces the importance of obtaining environmental clearance before undertaking any project, regardless of its nature.

The second court order pertains to a consent order in a case involving environmental clearance for a project in Haryana. The court accepted the respondent's undertaking to obtain ex post facto environmental clearance and comply with all terms and conditions. The court directed the appellant to consider the respondent's application for clearance. The appellant was also directed not to initiate any criminal action against the respondent or its officials. The court rejected the appellant's argument that the consent order was contrary to the statute and that the writ petition was not maintainable. The court held that the decision to initiate prosecution is a discretionary function and can only be interfered with if it is mala fide or motivated by improper considerations. This order highlights the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations, and the discretion of the government in initiating prosecution.

The third court order discusses the discretion of the government in initiating prosecution and withdrawing it. The court can only interfere if the withdrawal is mala fide or motivated by improper considerations. The court also mentions that the challenge made in the writ petition was not totally bogus and that the appellants cannot withdraw their consent given before the learned Single Judge. The court dismisses the appeal and refrains from imposing any costs on the appellants. This order emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in government actions related to environmental protection.

In conclusion, these court orders demonstrate the Indian judiciary's commitment to environmental protection and conservation. They highlight the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations, obtaining environmental clearance before undertaking any project, and the discretion of the government in initiating prosecution. These orders also emphasize the need for transparency and accountability in government actions related to environmental protection.
