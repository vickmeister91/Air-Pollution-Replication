The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Jojo J. Fencer, who is the second accused in a case registered under various sections of the Wildlife Conservation Act. The court has denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner, but has allowed him to surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material. The petitioner can then apply for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction. The court has ordered the petitioner to surrender on either the 11th or 12th of November 2010.

The Wildlife Conservation Act is a piece of legislation that seeks to protect and conserve wildlife in India. It contains provisions that prohibit the hunting, killing, or capturing of certain species of animals, as well as the trade in their body parts or products. The act also provides for the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, and sets out penalties for violations of its provisions.

In this case, Jojo J. Fencer is the second accused in a case registered under various sections of the Wildlife Conservation Act. It is not clear from the available information what specific charges have been brought against him, but it is likely that they relate to the hunting, killing, or capturing of protected species of animals, or the trade in their body parts or products.

The petitioner had filed an application for anticipatory bail, which is a type of bail that is granted before a person is arrested. It is intended to provide protection to a person who fears that he or she may be arrested for a non-bailable offence. The court, however, has denied the petitioner's application for anticipatory bail.

Instead, the court has allowed the petitioner to surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material. This means that the petitioner will have to present himself before the investigating officer and answer any questions that are put to him. The investigating officer may also search the petitioner's premises and seize any incriminating material that is found.

After the petitioner has surrendered and the investigating officer has completed his interrogation and search, the petitioner can then apply for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction. Regular bail is a type of bail that is granted after a person has been arrested. It is intended to provide temporary release to a person who has been arrested for a non-bailable offence, pending the completion of the trial.

The court has ordered the petitioner to surrender on either the 11th or 12th of November 2010. This means that the petitioner will have to present himself before the investigating officer on one of these two dates. If he fails to do so, he may be arrested and remanded in custody.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Jojo J. Fencer, who is the second accused in a case registered under various sections of the Wildlife Conservation Act. The court has denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner, but has allowed him to surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material. The petitioner can then apply for regular bail before the magistrate having jurisdiction. The court has ordered the petitioner to surrender on either the 11th or 12th of November 2010.
