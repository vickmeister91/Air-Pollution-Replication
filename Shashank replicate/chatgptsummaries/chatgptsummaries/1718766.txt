In the first case, M/S Ruchi Pvt. Ltd. and others filed an application for an injunction against M/S Indian Flame Enterprises and others under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 read with Section 151 CPC. The plaintiffs claimed that they have been using the trademark RUCHI in an artistic label for their food preparations since 1978 and have built a valuable trade under the said trademark. The defendants were using a similar trademark SAHARA RUCHI since 1999, which the plaintiffs claimed was a violation of their trademark and copyright.

The defendants argued that RUCHI is a common name and can be used by all and sundry, and that the leading character of their mark is not RUCHI. However, the court considered various precedents and held that the jurisdiction of the court does not depend upon the defense taken by the defendant and it is the allegations made in the plaint which decide the forum. The court also held that the essential and other features of the mark, if taken as a whole, would make the mark deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. Therefore, the court granted the injunction in favor of the plaintiffs.

Moving on to the second case, the court order discusses a suit where the plaintiff has filed a case against the defendant for using a deceptively similar trademark and label for their food products made from Soya flour. The court has considered the arguments of both parties and has held that the plaintiff's claim of territorial jurisdiction is valid. The court has also applied the principles of similarity in trademarks and has found that the defendant's use of the word "Ruchi" along with "Sahara" is likely to deceive or cause confusion among the consumers.

Therefore, the court has granted an injunction restraining the defendant from using a similar trademark and label until the disposal of the suit. The court has also ordered the matter to be listed before the Joint Registrar for admission/denial of documents and for framing of issues.

In both cases, the court has considered the principles of trademark law and has granted injunctions in favor of the plaintiffs. The court has held that the use of a deceptively similar trademark and label is likely to cause confusion among the consumers and is a violation of the plaintiff's trademark and copyright. The court has also considered the jurisdictional issues and has held that the allegations made in the plaint decide the forum.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of trademark law and the need to protect one's intellectual property rights. It is essential for businesses to conduct a thorough trademark search before using a particular mark to avoid any legal disputes in the future. The court's decision in these cases serves as a reminder to businesses to be cautious while using trademarks and to respect the intellectual property rights of others.
