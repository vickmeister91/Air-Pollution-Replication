In a recent court order, a criminal misc. petition filed by Smt. Anuradha and her minor son Vansh against Rajesh Gaur was addressed. The petitioners had sought the quashing of an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nagaur, dismissing their application filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. for summoning certain documents. The petitioners argued that the documents were necessary to determine the quantum of maintenance.

The court carefully considered the arguments presented by the petitioners and ultimately allowed the petition. The impugned order was set aside, and the application filed by the petitioners for summoning the bank account and pay slip of the respondent husband was granted.

This court order is significant because it highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant documents are considered when determining the quantum of maintenance. The court recognized that the documents requested by the petitioners were necessary to make an informed decision about the amount of maintenance that should be awarded.

It is worth noting that Section 125 Cr.P.C. provides for the payment of maintenance to wives, children, and parents who are unable to maintain themselves. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that those who are dependent on others for their livelihood are not left without support.

In this case, the petitioners had argued that the documents they were seeking were necessary to determine the amount of maintenance that should be awarded to them. The court agreed with this argument and granted their application for summoning the bank account and pay slip of the respondent husband.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully considering all relevant documents when making decisions about maintenance payments. It also highlights the fact that individuals who are dependent on others for their livelihood have legal rights that must be protected.
