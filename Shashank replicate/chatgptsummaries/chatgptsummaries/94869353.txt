The court order in question pertains to an application filed by Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking anticipatory bail in connection with a first information report registered against him for offences punishable under Sections 66(B), 65(A) (E), 81, 82 and 99 f Bombay Prohibition Act. The court granted anticipatory bail to the applicant on certain conditions, including cooperating with the investigation, making himself available for interrogation, not hampering the investigation, and not leaving India without the permission of the court.

The case against Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave was registered under various sections of the Bombay Prohibition Act, which prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Maharashtra. The specific sections under which he was charged include Section 66(B), which deals with the illegal import, export, and transportation of liquor, Section 65(A) (E), which deals with the possession of liquor without a permit, Section 81, which deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act, Section 82, which deals with the punishment for abetment of an offence under the Act, and Section 99, which deals with the power of the police to arrest without a warrant.

In his application for anticipatory bail, Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave argued that he was innocent of the charges against him and that he had been falsely implicated in the case. He also argued that he was a law-abiding citizen with no criminal record and that he had cooperated fully with the investigation so far.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court granted anticipatory bail to Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave on certain conditions. The first condition was that he must cooperate fully with the investigation and make himself available for interrogation whenever required by the police. The second condition was that he must not hamper the investigation in any way, either by destroying evidence or by influencing witnesses. The third condition was that he must not leave India without the permission of the court.

The court also allowed Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave to approach the concerned court for modification or deletion of any of the conditions of the order. This means that if he feels that any of the conditions are too onerous or unfair, he can ask the court to change them.

Overall, the court order granting anticipatory bail to Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave is significant because it shows that the court is willing to consider the individual circumstances of each case when deciding whether to grant bail. In this case, the court was satisfied that Bharatbhai Ratilal Dave was not a flight risk and that he was unlikely to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. As a result, the court granted him anticipatory bail on certain conditions, which he must now abide by if he wishes to avoid arrest.
