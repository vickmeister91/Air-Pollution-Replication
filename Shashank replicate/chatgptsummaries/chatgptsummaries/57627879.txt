The court order pertains to a second appeal case between Pandurang and Ramappa. The appeal is against a judgment and order passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Darwha, in Regular Civil Appeal No.160 of 2004, which arose from judgment and order dated 28.11.2003, passed by the learned Joint Civil Judge Junior Division, Digras, in Regular Civil Suit No.112 of 2001, whereby the suit was dismissed. The appellant/plaintiff had instituted Regular Civil Suit No.112 of 2001, in the Court of Civil Judge Junior Division, Digras, with a prayer for possession of the suit agricultural land bearing Survey No.12/03 with an area of 1H 41R situated at village Belora, Taluka Digras, District Yavatmal. The appellant/plaintiff claims that both the Courts below ignored the judgment and order as well as final decree in former Regular Civil Suit No.56 of 1991 between the same parties wherein the respondent/defendant had sold the suit land to the appellant/plaintiff.

The plaintiff had paid Rs. 14,000 as earnest money to the defendant but did not prove that he paid Rs. 4,600 towards the remaining consideration. The defendant did not prove that he made a loan transaction with the plaintiff and signed on blank stamp paper as security for the amount. The court decreed in favor of the plaintiff, directing the defendant to execute the sale deed in favor of the plaintiff by paying the balance amount of consideration or depositing the same in the court within the allowed time. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant took forcible possession of the land despite the sale deed being executed. The court found that the trial court and the first appellate court erred in law by overlooking the principle of res judicata and dismissed the suit for possession based on the title. The court also stated that the plaintiff became the lawful owner and was already in possession of the suit land.

The defendant argued that interference in the second appeal would not be warranted as there are concurrent findings of facts recorded by the courts below. However, the court cited a ruling to argue that the high court can interfere with the findings of fact even when the courts below recorded concurrent findings. The court ruling states that the High Court can interfere with the findings of fact in a Second Appeal if the findings recorded by the lower courts are found to be perverse, not based on evidence, or where the core issue is not decided. There is no absolute bar on the reappreciation of evidence in exceptional circumstances. The court can interfere with the finding of facts in exceptional cases where the lower courts ignored material evidence or acted on no evidence, drew wrong interference from the proved facts by applying law erroneously, or wrongly cast the burden of proof. In the larger interest of justice, when the second appellate court finds a substantial question of law, interference is permissible.

The suit in question is decreed as prayed for, and there shall be an enquiry into mesne profits under Order XX Rule 12 of the Civil Procedure Code for wrongful occupation by the respondent/defendant.
