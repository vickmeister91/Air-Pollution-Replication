The court order pertains to three different cases where writ petitions were filed challenging the termination of employment. In the first case, the petitioner, Shiv Pujan Paswan, challenged his termination from a teaching job in Bihar due to invalid certification. The court upheld the termination, stating that the employer has the right to verify training certificates and terminate employees if they are found to be inappropriate. The petitioner's claim that principles of natural justice were not followed was dismissed, citing the "useless formality theory" and a previous Supreme Court judgment. The court also quoted various cases and literature on the subject of natural justice.

The second case discussed the issue of whether a court can issue a writ even if natural justice is not followed. The court cites various opinions and cases, but ultimately decides not to express an opinion on the matter. The court notes that unless failure of justice is occasioned or it would not be in public interest to do so, the court may refuse to grant relief to the concerned employee. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition.

In the third case, the court dismissed a writ petition as it found no merit in the petitioner's contention, based on previous judgments. The court did not provide any further details on the case.

The common thread running through all three cases is the issue of natural justice. Natural justice is a legal principle that requires fair procedures to be followed in any decision-making process. It is based on the idea that everyone is entitled to a fair hearing and that decisions should be made impartially and without bias. The principle of natural justice is an important safeguard against arbitrary or unfair decisions.

In the first case, the court upheld the termination of employment on the grounds that the employer had the right to verify training certificates and terminate employees if they were found to be inappropriate. The court dismissed the petitioner's claim that principles of natural justice were not followed, citing the "useless formality theory" and a previous Supreme Court judgment. The court also quoted various cases and literature on the subject of natural justice.

The "useless formality theory" is a legal principle that states that if a procedure is followed but has no real effect on the outcome of a decision, it is not necessary to follow that procedure. In this case, the court found that the petitioner's claim that principles of natural justice were not followed was a "useless formality" as the employer had the right to verify training certificates and terminate employees if they were found to be inappropriate.

In the second case, the court discussed the issue of whether a court can issue a writ even if natural justice is not followed. The court cited various opinions and cases, but ultimately decided not to express an opinion on the matter. The court noted that unless failure of justice is occasioned or it would not be in public interest to do so, the court may refuse to grant relief to the concerned employee. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The third case was dismissed by the court as it found no merit in the petitioner's contention, based on previous judgments. The court did not provide any further details on the case.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to three different cases where writ petitions were filed challenging the termination of employment. The common thread running through all three cases is the issue of natural justice. The court upheld the termination of employment in the first case, dismissed the writ petition in the second case, and dismissed the writ petition in the third case. The court cited various opinions and cases on the issue of natural justice, but ultimately did not express an opinion on the matter. The principle of natural justice is an important safeguard against arbitrary or unfair decisions, and it is important for employers to follow fair procedures in any decision-making process.
