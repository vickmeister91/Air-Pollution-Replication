The court recently heard arguments from the petitioner, the standing counsel for the respondents, and the caveator regarding the management of Panchayat Raj Inter College. The petitioner argued that they were elected as manager in the last recognized elections, and that fresh elections were held in accordance with the approved Scheme of Administration. However, the Regional Level Committee did not consider the legality of these elections, and the District Inspector of Schools ordered single operation of the account under the Payment of Salary Act.

After hearing all arguments, the court found that the previous Committee of Management had become time-barred, and that the subsequent elections had not yet been recognized by the competent authority. Therefore, there was no recognized management to operate the bank account, and the order of single operation was necessary. However, the court directed the Regional Level Committee to decide on the legality of the elections within one month and withdraw the order of single operation if the elections were recognized.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining recognition from competent authorities. The petitioner's argument that they were elected as manager in the last recognized elections may have been valid, but without recognition from the competent authority, their claim was not legally binding. Similarly, the subsequent elections held in accordance with the approved Scheme of Administration were not recognized by the competent authority, rendering them invalid.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in the management of educational institutions. The Regional Level Committee's failure to consider the legality of the elections and the District Inspector of Schools' order of single operation of the account under the Payment of Salary Act suggest a lack of transparency and accountability in the management of Panchayat Raj Inter College.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder to educational institutions and their management committees to follow proper procedures and obtain recognition from competent authorities. It also highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in the management of educational institutions.
