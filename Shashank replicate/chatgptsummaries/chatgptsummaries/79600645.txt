The court order in question pertains to a mining lease that was granted after clearance from the Forest department, but was subsequently revoked after it was found to be in a forest area. The mining department then cancelled the lease. The petitioner, who was the lessee, challenged the cancellation of the lease before the High Court.

The High Court, in its ruling, stated that the issue of cancellation of the mining lease cannot be agitated before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but the order passed by the forest department withdrawing the no objection certificate can be challenged before the NGT. The court also transferred the writ petition to the NGT and continued the interim order for four weeks.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary clearances and permissions before undertaking any activity in a forest area. The Forest department's no objection certificate is a crucial document that must be obtained before any mining activity can be undertaken in a forest area. Failure to obtain this certificate can result in the cancellation of the mining lease, as was the case in this instance.

The court's ruling also underscores the role of the NGT in adjudicating environmental disputes. The NGT was established in 2010 to handle cases related to environmental protection and conservation. It has the power to hear cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, and to provide relief and compensation for damages caused by environmental harm.

In this case, the court recognized the NGT's jurisdiction over disputes related to the withdrawal of the no objection certificate by the Forest department. The NGT will now have the opportunity to hear the petitioner's case and provide a ruling on the matter.

The court's decision to transfer the writ petition to the NGT is also significant. The NGT has specialized expertise in environmental matters and is better equipped to handle cases related to environmental protection and conservation. By transferring the case to the NGT, the court has ensured that the matter will be heard by a specialized tribunal that is better equipped to handle the complexities of environmental disputes.

Overall, the court's ruling in this case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary clearances and permissions before undertaking any activity in a forest area. It also underscores the role of the NGT in adjudicating environmental disputes and the importance of transferring cases related to environmental protection and conservation to specialized tribunals.
