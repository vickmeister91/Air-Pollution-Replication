The court order in question relates to a case between Western Coalfields Ltd and the M.P. State Diversity Board. The notice that had been issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is set to be withdrawn, as confirmed by the respondents' counsel. The petitioners, in this case, had sought permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh, if needed.

The case between Western Coalfields Ltd and the M.P. State Diversity Board has been a contentious one, with the Biodiversity Board issuing a notice under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. This notice had been challenged by the petitioners, who had sought relief from the court. However, with the respondents' counsel confirming that the notice is set to be withdrawn, the petitioners have sought permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed.

The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh, if needed. This means that the petitioners can approach the court again if they feel that their rights have been violated in any way. The court has not made any ruling on the merits of the case, and the withdrawal of the notice does not necessarily mean that the petitioners have won the case.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to conserve India's biodiversity. The Act provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, which are responsible for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in their respective areas. The Act also provides for the establishment of State Biodiversity Boards and a National Biodiversity Authority, which are responsible for the implementation of the Act at the state and national levels, respectively.

Section 7 of the Act deals with the regulation of access to biological resources. It provides that no person shall obtain any biological resource for commercial utilization without the prior approval of the National Biodiversity Authority. The Act also provides for the sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources with the local communities who have conserved and protected these resources.

In the case between Western Coalfields Ltd and the M.P. State Diversity Board, it is not clear what the nature of the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board was. However, it is likely that it pertained to the regulation of access to biological resources, as this is the main focus of Section 7 of the Act. It is also possible that the notice was issued in response to some activity undertaken by Western Coalfields Ltd that was deemed to be in violation of the Act.

The withdrawal of the notice by the Biodiversity Board is significant, as it indicates that the Board may have found that there was no violation of the Act by Western Coalfields Ltd. However, it is important to note that the withdrawal of the notice does not necessarily mean that the company has been absolved of any wrongdoing. It is possible that the Board may have withdrawn the notice for other reasons, such as a lack of evidence or a procedural error.

The court's decision to allow the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed is also significant. It indicates that the court recognizes the importance of the issues raised by the petitioners and is willing to hear the case again if necessary. This is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing and an opportunity to present their case.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between Western Coalfields Ltd and the M.P. State Diversity Board is significant for several reasons. The withdrawal of the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is a positive development for Western Coalfields Ltd, but it does not necessarily mean that the company has been absolved of any wrongdoing. The court's decision to allow the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed is also significant, as it indicates that the court is willing to hear the case again if necessary. Overall, the court order highlights the importance of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and the need to ensure that it is implemented effectively to conserve India's rich biodiversity.
