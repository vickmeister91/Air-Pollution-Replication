The Orissa High Court recently heard a case against the South Eastern Railway Hotel and its manager for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The hotel was found to be discharging effluent without treatment, and the Orissa State Pollution Control Board issued a notice for the hotel to set up an effluent treatment plant. However, the hotel failed to comply with the notice, and the case was filed for commission of an offense under Section 41(2) of the Act.

The trial court convicted both the hotel and its manager, but the High Court found that only the Head of the Department could be prosecuted under Section 48 of the Act. Therefore, the conviction and sentence were set aside.

The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act.

In this case, the Orissa State Pollution Control Board had issued a notice to the South Eastern Railway Hotel to set up an effluent treatment plant. However, the hotel failed to comply with the notice, and the case was filed for commission of an offense under Section 41(2) of the Act.

The trial court convicted both the hotel and its manager, but the High Court found that only the Head of the Department could be prosecuted under Section 48 of the Act. Section 48 of the Act provides that where an offense under the Act has been committed by a company, every person who, at the time the offense was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offense and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

The High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the responsibilities of different individuals and entities under the Act. It also emphasizes the need for companies to comply with the provisions of the Act and take steps to prevent and control water pollution.

Overall, the Orissa High Court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws in India. It also underscores the need for companies to take their environmental responsibilities seriously and comply with the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
