The court order in question relates to a case between Vippy Industries Ltd. and Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity. The issue at hand is a notice that was issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. However, the respondents' counsel has stated that this notice is going to be withdrawn.

The petitioners in this case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions, with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation in India that seeks to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge. The Act aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use of its components, and ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources.

Section 7 of the Act deals with the procedure for obtaining prior approval of the National Biodiversity Authority before accessing biological resources. The Act requires that any person or organization seeking to access biological resources for commercial or research purposes must obtain prior approval from the National Biodiversity Authority.

In this case, the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board had issued a notice under Section 7 of the Act to Vippy Industries Ltd. The notice was issued on the grounds that Vippy Industries Ltd. had allegedly accessed biological resources without obtaining prior approval from the Board.

However, the respondents' counsel has now stated that the notice is going to be withdrawn. It is unclear why the notice is being withdrawn, but it is possible that Vippy Industries Ltd. has since obtained the necessary approvals from the Board.

The petitioners in this case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions, with the liberty to file afresh if needed. It is not clear what the nature of these petitions was, but it is possible that they were seeking to challenge the notice issued by the Board.

The court has allowed the petitioners' prayer and has dismissed the petitions as withdrawn. The petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh if needed. This means that they are free to file fresh petitions if they feel that their rights have been violated in any way.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a notice issued by the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The notice is going to be withdrawn, and the petitioners have been granted permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has dismissed the petitions as withdrawn, and the petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh if needed.
