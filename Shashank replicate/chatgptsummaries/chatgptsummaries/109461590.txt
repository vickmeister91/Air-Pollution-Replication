The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the payment of property tax and the right to appeal in accordance with the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. The first court order pertains to a writ petition challenging the amended Section 169 of the Act. The petitioners argued that the proviso to Section 169(1) makes the remedy of appeal to the Municipal Taxation Tribunal illusory as it requires the full amount of the property tax to be paid before filing an appeal. The court examined the facts of the case and relevant provisions and heard arguments from both sides. Ultimately, the court did not find the proviso to Section 169(1) unconstitutional and dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order discusses the conflict between two sections of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act regarding the payment of property tax before filing an appeal. The petitioner argues that the requirement to pay 100% of the property tax before filing an appeal makes the remedy of appeal illusory. The court examines the validity of the proviso to Section 169(1) of the Act and cites a Supreme Court decision in a similar case to support the imposition of conditions for the exercise of the right of appeal. The court also considers an alternative argument regarding the right of appeal as a vested right.

The third court order discusses the validity of conditions imposed on the right to appeal, specifically the requirement of pre-deposit of a sum of money. The court states that such conditions are valid as long as they are not so onerous as to render the right to appeal almost illusory. The court also notes that the right to appeal is a statutory right and can be circumscribed by conditions in the grant. The court cites previous cases where milder provisions allowing for the waiver or relaxation of the deposit condition were upheld. Ultimately, the court finds that the condition of pre-deposit is not unreasonably onerous and does not violate the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution.

The fourth court order discusses the interpretation of Section 170 (b) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, which requires the payment of disputed tax prior to the filing of an appeal. The Supreme Court upheld the provision but noted that the right of appeal is a creature of the statute and conditions can be imposed as long as they are not onerous. The court also expressed a desire for suitable amendments to be made to the Act. The court interpreted the provision as a bar to the hearing and disposal of the appeal on merits, but not as a bar to the entertainment of the appeal itself. The court suggested that the appellate authority should be trusted to exercise discretion in safeguarding the interests of both the Revenue and the assessees.

The fifth court order discusses the legality of a provision in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act that requires the full payment of property tax before filing an appeal. The court finds that this provision is onerous and unreasonable, rendering the right of appeal illusory. The court cites previous cases where similar provisions were upheld due to the meagre amount of pre-deposit required or the presence of a safety valve clause for dispensation of the pre-deposit amount. However, in this case, the property tax amount is significant, and there is no provision for dispensation. Therefore, the court strikes down the provision as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to the payment of property tax and the right to appeal in accordance with the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. The courts have examined the validity of various provisions and conditions imposed on the right to appeal, ultimately finding some to be valid and others to be onerous and unconstitutional. The courts have also expressed a desire for suitable amendments to be made to the Act to ensure that the right to appeal is not rendered illusory.
