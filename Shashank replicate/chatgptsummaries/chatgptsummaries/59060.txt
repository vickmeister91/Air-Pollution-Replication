The Ganga river, one of the most sacred rivers in India, has been facing severe pollution for decades. In response to a case filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India and others regarding the pollution of the Ganga river in Kanpur, the court issued a series of orders to prevent further pollution and protect the environment.

The court found that the Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika was primarily responsible for the pollution and directed them to take various actions to prevent further pollution, including submitting proposals for sewage treatment works and preventing the throwing of corpses into the river. The court also directed the government to introduce lessons on environmental protection in schools and to organize annual cleanliness weeks. The court order applies to all municipalities with jurisdiction over the Ganga river.

The court also issued certain directions with regard to the industries in which the business of tanning was being carried out at Jajmau near Kanpur on the banks of the river Ganga. The court discussed the duties and powers of the Mahapalika and Mahapalika authorities as set out in Chapter V of the Adhiniyam. The court also cited various sections of the Adhiniyam related to the provision of means for disposal of sewage, collection and removal of excrementitious and polluted matter, removal of carcasses of dead animals, and prohibition of cultivation, use of manure, and irrigation injurious to health.

The court order discusses provisions in the Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act and the Water Act related to the responsibilities of local bodies in maintaining cleanliness and protecting the environment. The Water Act establishes Central and State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution, with the State Board having executive powers to implement the Act. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 also contains provisions related to the control, prevention, and abatement of water pollution. The court notes that many of these provisions have not been adequately enforced.

The court order discusses a report by the U.P. Pollution Control Board on measures taken to prevent pollution of the river Ganga, specifically in Kanpur. The report reveals that 274.50 million litres of sewage water is being discharged into the river Ganga from Kanpur, making it the second-highest in the country after Calcutta. The court also notes that various local bodies and government agencies have taken action to minimize pollution, but the discharge of untreated effluents into the river Ganga will only be stopped up to 80% by March 1988. The court also cites a Progress Report that shows the water in the river Ganga at Kanpur is of the highest degree of pollution.

The court order discusses the issue of water pollution in India, specifically in the Ganga river. The report highlights the need for major nullahs to be diverted and treated, and for effluent treatment plants to be installed by major polluting industries. The order also emphasizes the dangers of water-borne diseases, particularly in tropical developing countries, and the importance of controlling water pollution for the health and well-being of the population. The book "Water Pollution and disposal of Waste Water on Land" by U.N. Mahida is referenced, which discusses the history of sewage disposal and the benefits of controlling water pollution.

The court order discusses the importance of preventing pollution in industrial waste waters and the responsibility of industries to treat their trade wastes. It emphasizes the urgency of the problem and the need for developing countries to implement pollution prevention policies. The court also orders the Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika to take immediate action to prevent pollution of the river Ganga, including increasing the size of sewers, constructing public latrines and urinals, and preventing the collection of manure at private pits. The court also suggests organizing "Keep the city clean" weeks to raise awareness about cleanliness and pollution prevention. Finally, the court orders the Central Government to direct educational institutions to teach lessons on protecting and improving the natural environment.

The court suggests that the organisation of a week dedicated to the environment should be entrusted to local authorities such as Nagar Mahapalikas, Municipal Corporations, Town Municipalities, and Village Panchayats. During this week, all citizens, including members of the executive, parliament, state legislatures, and judiciary, should cooperate with the local authorities and take part in celebrations by rendering free personal service. The Ministry of Environment of the Government of India is requested to consider this suggestion seriously.

The case against Nagar Mahapalikas and Municipalities in the state of Uttar Pradesh is adjourned for six months, during which they must file affidavits explaining the steps they have taken to prevent pollution of the river Ganga. The case against industries located on the banks of the river Ganga will be taken up for hearing on February 9, 1988.

In summary, the court order issued a series of directions to prevent further pollution of the Ganga river in Kanpur. The court found that the Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika was primarily responsible for the pollution and directed them to take various actions to prevent further pollution. The court also directed the government to introduce lessons on environmental protection in schools and to organize annual cleanliness weeks.
