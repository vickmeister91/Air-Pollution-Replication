The Bombay High Court recently considered a case involving three different colleges and their dispute with the Fees Regulating Authority and other government departments. The main question at hand was whether autonomous colleges should be subject to the same fee regulations as other colleges and universities. The judgment was reserved on January 19, 2018, and pronounced on January 25, 2018.

The court order pertained to three petitions filed by autonomous colleges/institutions in Maharashtra, questioning whether they are governed by the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fees) Act, 2015. The factual position in all three matters was undisputed, and the court heard them together. The court found a prima facie case and issued notice to the learned Advocate General, as there was a conflict between the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 and the 2016 Universities Act. The court granted rule and interim protection to the petitioners and directed the Authority to decide the issue with regard to jurisdiction within a period of four weeks.

The court order pertained to a case where the petitioners, who are autonomous colleges, were seeking complete administrative, academic, and financial autonomy as granted to them under the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994. The petitioners argued that the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 should not be applicable to them as they are a distinct class of institutions. The state argued that the autonomy granted to the petitioners is subject to the provisions of the 1994 Universities Act and that the autonomy is limited to certain purposes. The court had to determine whether the petitioners were entitled to complete autonomy or whether they were subject to the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015.

The court order discussed the applicability of the Regulation Act of 2015, which regulates fees in professional unaided colleges, to autonomous institutions. The learned Senior Counsel argued that the Regulation Act of 2015 is a special law and the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts are general laws. The court examined the provisions of the Acts and the Statutes framed under them to determine the autonomy granted to colleges and institutions. The court found that autonomous institutions have full academic, administrative, and financial autonomy subject to the provisions of the Acts and Statutes. The court also noted that the Regulation Act of 2015 cannot take away the autonomy granted to autonomous institutions.

The court order discussed various sections of the Universities Act, including the definition of "autonomous college" and the process for granting autonomous status to institutions. It also outlined the establishment of a Fee Fixation Committee to determine tuition fees and charges for courses and programs offered by universities, colleges, and recognized institutions. The committee is composed of various members, including a retired Vice-Chancellor or educationist as Chairperson, the Dean of the faculty concerned, and a finance expert nominated by the Vice-Chancellor. The order also allowed for colleges and recognized institutions to submit proposals for different fees, which will be decided by the fee fixation committee.

The court order discussed the process for fee fixation and the granting of autonomous status to universities and colleges. The fee fixation committee will evaluate additional facilities provided by institutions and make final decisions on tuition fees and charges. Autonomous institutions will have full academic and administrative autonomy, subject to the provisions of the Act and Statutes. The Board of Management of autonomous institutions will have the power to fix fees and charges payable by students, raise resources, and utilize them solely for the purpose of the institution's development. The order also defines "Private Professional Educational Institution" under the Regulation Act of 2015.

The court order discussed the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act of 2011, which establishes a Fees Regulating Authority to determine the reasonableness of fees charged by private professional educational institutions. The Authority is responsible for verifying that fees do not amount to profiteering or charging of capitation fees, scrutinizing fee proposals, and approving fees within 120 days of receipt of proposals. Unaided institutions must submit proposals for upward revision of fees by October 31st of the previous academic year, and the Authority may prescribe its own procedures for scrutiny of proposals and grievance redressal. The order also defines private professional educational institutions and professional education.

The court order discussed the regulations for determining the reasonableness of fees for unaided institutions, which may be revised with prior approval from the Fees Regulating Authority. It also explained the concept of autonomy granted to colleges, institutions, or university departments, allowing them to conduct academic programs and examinations, develop syllabi, and issue certificates. The Management Board is empowered to fix fees, but they should not exceed the cost of education per student. Autonomous institutions can raise their own resources through various methods, including revising fees with permission from the Academic Board and Board of Management.

The court order discussed the differences between the definitions of "autonomous college" and "autonomy" in the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts. It also explained the provisions of Section 101 of the 2016 Universities Act, which establishes a Fee Fixation Committee to determine the cost of courses and programs and sets guidelines for fees. The order also defines "Private Professional Educational Institution" and "Professional Education" under the Regulation Act of 2015 and outlines the functions and powers of the Fees Regulating Authority.

The court order discussed the conflict between the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fees) Act,
