The court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s. A.J. S. Deformer Pvt. Ltd. and another against the State of Haryana and others. The petitioners had applied for a No Objection Certificate to set up a stone crusher unit in village Silkho, Tehsil Tauru, District Mewat. The State of Haryana had formulated rules known as Haryana Regulation and Control of Crushers Rules, 1992, which lay down the procedure and formalities to be completed by the applicant before permission is granted. The petitioners had completed all formalities as per the 1992 Rules, but their application was declined due to a ban on mining of minor minerals in Mewat district. The court was approached to challenge this decision.

The court order discusses the issue of illegal mining in the state of Haryana and the directive issued by the Director of Mines and Geology to the Pollution Control Board not to issue licenses for stone crushers. The court notes that illegal mining is being carried out with the blessings of officers responsible for stopping it. The State of Haryana is directed to take measures to stop illegal mining and confiscate illegally extracted material. The court also notes that no new licenses for stone crushing units will be granted until further orders due to the non-availability of minor minerals within the state.

The court order allows for the granting of licenses for new stone crusher units in the state, despite concerns that they may encourage obtaining raw materials from illegal sources. The order was passed due to pressure from state officers to show activity, but the court found it discriminatory and in violation of constitutional provisions. The order stopping the granting of new licenses was quashed, and directions were issued to look into applications and grant licenses if they meet parameters. The state was urged to take remedial measures to stop illegal mining.
