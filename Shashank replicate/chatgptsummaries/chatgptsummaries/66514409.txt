The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission heard two consumer complaints filed by Usha Rani against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. and another. The complaints involved the purchase of a residential plot in the IREO Hamlet project in Sector 98, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The complainant purchased the plot from the original buyers for the purpose of giving it to her daughter in marriage. The rights in the property were transferred to the complainant, and she deposited various amounts with the Opposite Parties. The court disposed of both complaints with a single order.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, seeking a refund of Rs. 65,11,568/- along with interest, compensation for mental agony and physical harassment, and cost of litigation. The complaint alleged deficiency in service and unfair trade practices by the opposite parties who failed to carry out internal developments as per the agreement and did not hand over possession of the allotted plot within the stipulated time. The opposite parties raised preliminary objections, including the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court examined the evidence and record of the case and concluded that the possession was offered before the filing of the complaint, but the development work had started two years after the execution of the agreement. The court also noted the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement and referred the matter to arbitration.

The court order discusses whether a consumer complaint can be settled through arbitration when there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court concludes that the existence of an arbitration clause does not prevent the Consumer Foras from entertaining consumer complaints. The court also rejects the objection raised by the Opposite Parties that the complainant had purchased the plot for investment/commercial purposes and therefore would not fall within the definition of a consumer.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by a woman who purchased a plot of land for her daughter's marriage. The defendants argued that the complaint was not maintainable as the complainant did not buy goods or hire services, and that the jurisdiction of the court was barred by a clause in the agreement. The court rejected these objections, stating that the complainant was a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, and that housing construction falls within the definition of a service. The court also held that clauses of jurisdiction in agreements cannot be made applicable to consumer complaints filed before consumer forums.

The court order discusses a case where a complainant filed a complaint against a company for not providing proper possession of a plot. The court rejected the company's objection to jurisdiction and held that the complainant had a right to file the complaint where a part of the cause of action arose. The court also found that the company had not provided complete and proper possession of the plot and had not obtained necessary approvals. As a result, the complainant was entitled to a refund of the deposited amount. The court cited previous cases to support its decision.

The court order states that the complainants in two cases are entitled to a refund of their deposited amount along with interest and compensation for mental agony and physical harassment due to the Opposite Parties' deficiency in rendering service and indulgence into unfair trade practice. The court also mentions the rate of interest to be granted and the timeline for the refund. The Opposite Parties are held liable and directed to comply with the court's orders within a specified period failing which they will be liable to pay the amounts with interest.

The court order requires the Opposite Parties to pay 8% per annum simple interest on the deposited amount(s) from 12.08.2015 onwards within 45 days of receiving a certified copy of the order. If they fail to do so, they will be liable to pay the amount with interest at different rates. The Opposite Parties are also required to pay Rs.1,50,000/- as compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service and unfair trade practices, and Rs.35,000/- as cost of litigation to the complainant within 45 days of receiving a certified copy of the order. If they fail to do so, they will be liable to pay the above amounts with interest at 12% p.a. (simple) from the date of filing the complaint till realization. The court also mentions that if the complainant has availed loan facility from any financial institution(s), such an institution shall have the first charge on the amount payable. The order is pronounced on 17.07.2017.

In summary, the court order pertains to multiple consumer complaints filed against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. and another regarding the purchase of residential plots in the IREO Hamlet project in Sector 98, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The court rejected objections raised by the Opposite Parties, including the existence of an arbitration clause and the jurisdiction of the court. The court found the Opposite Parties liable for deficiency in service and unfair trade practices and ordered them to refund the deposited amounts with interest and compensation for mental agony and physical harassment. The court also required the Opposite Parties to pay the cost of litigation and interest on the amounts payable. The court's decision highlights the importance of consumer protection and upholding consumer rights.
