The first order involves a case in the Mudigere Taluk area, where the petitioners and respondents are involved in a dispute over land. The order does not provide details on the specific nature of the disputes or the outcome of the case. The respondents include individuals, government officials, and committees involved in the management of the Sri Kalasheshwara Swamy Temple.

The second order is regarding review petitions filed under Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC, praying for a review of the order dated 20-04-2012 passed in WA NOS.1453-1464/2005 (KLR-RES)C/W WA NO.1558/2007 (GM-FOR) & WP NO.9573/1999 (LR-PIL), on the file of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, Bangalore. The petitioners and respondents are listed, with some being deleted or deceased. The cause title has been amended.

The third order pertains to a review petition filed by petitioners seeking a review of a judgment and order passed by the court in 2012. The petitioners have sought a declaration that the order is not binding on them and have also challenged certain notices issued by the Assistant Conservator of Forest. The order also mentions the respondents in the case and their respective legal representatives.

The fourth order pertains to a dispute over land belonging to the Kalaseshwara Swamy Temple in Chikmagalur District. The petitioners argue that a 2012 court order is not binding on them as they were not parties to the proceedings. They also challenge certain notices issued by the Assistant Conservator of Forest and seek to quash a 1928 government notification. The court considers arguments from both sides and notes that the 2012 order was made in a public interest litigation and is binding on all parties. The court also considers the validity of the 1928 notification and related actions.

The fifth order pertains to a dispute over forest lands in Karnataka, India. The court considered various notifications and regulations related to the lands and ultimately held that the lands were forest lands and not Inam lands. The court also held that grants made in respect of the lands without approval of the Central Government were void and invalid. The court ordered the eviction of occupants and grantees of the lands, but allowed for certain beneficiaries of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act to bring evidence of their possession and cultivation prior to 1964 for consideration by the Central Government. The Conservator of Forests was directed to undertake an exercise to evict occupants and grantees who did not satisfy the conditions stipulated by the court.

The sixth order pertains to the eviction of individuals who are occupying forest lands without proper authorization. The court has set aside an earlier order in favor of some respondents and has directed the Conservator of Forests to evict all unauthorized occupants and take possession of the land. The court has also clarified the definition of "forest" under the Forest Conservation Act, stating that it includes all forests as understood in the dictionary sense, statutorily recognized forests, and forest land recorded as such in government records.

The seventh order discusses the Forest Conservation Act and its provisions regarding the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. It states that prior approval from the Central Government is mandatory before granting forest land for non-forest activities. The court also notes that the definition of "District Forest" is inclusive and wide enough to include all land at the disposal of the government except for land within reserved or village forests or assigned for public or communal purposes. The court cites various judgments to support its decision and concludes that the grants made in favor of various grantees, including the petitioners, may be quashed if the Forest Conservation Act was ignored while making the grants.

The eighth order cites various previous court decisions to support its conclusion that forest lands cannot be claimed by individuals and that the revenue records and saguvali chits are of no consequence. The court also notes that the writ petitions in this case have been pending for over a decade and that the petitioners had ample opportunity to be aware of the proceedings. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petitions and review petitions without costs.

In summary, these court orders involve various land disputes in Karnataka, India, including disputes over forest lands and land belonging to temples. The court has made several rulings, including the eviction of unauthorized occupants and the quashing of grants made without approval from the Central Government. The court has also clarified the definition of "forest" under the Forest Conservation Act and dismissed some writ petitions and review petitions.
