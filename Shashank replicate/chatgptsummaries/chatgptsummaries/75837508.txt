The court order in question relates to an appeal filed by Ajay Kumar Gupta against the orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal, MCD Tis Hazari, Delhi. The orders directed the demolition of the entire building owned by the appellant. The appeal was dismissed on the grounds that the jurisdiction of the court to entertain any proceedings against an order passed under Section 343 is barred under Section 347 E. However, the appellant was not precluded from filing an appeal against the orders impugned as provided for under the Act before the appropriate authority in accordance with the law.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the demolition of a building owned by Ajay Kumar Gupta. The Appellate Tribunal, MCD Tis Hazari, Delhi had passed orders directing the demolition of the entire building. In response, Gupta filed an appeal challenging the orders passed by the Tribunal. However, the appeal was dismissed by the court on the grounds that the jurisdiction of the court to entertain any proceedings against an order passed under Section 343 is barred under Section 347 E.

Section 343 of the Act pertains to the power of the Commissioner to order the demolition of a building that is deemed to be dangerous or likely to cause danger to human life or property. Section 347 E, on the other hand, bars the jurisdiction of the court to entertain any proceedings against an order passed under Section 343. This means that once an order is passed under Section 343, the court cannot entertain any proceedings challenging the order.

In this case, the court held that since the orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal were under Section 343, the court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain any proceedings challenging the orders. Therefore, the appeal filed by Gupta was dismissed.

However, the court also noted that the appellant was not precluded from filing an appeal against the orders impugned as provided for under the Act before the appropriate authority in accordance with the law. This means that while the court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, Gupta could still file an appeal before the appropriate authority in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of the court and the limitations on its power. While the court may not have the jurisdiction to entertain certain proceedings, it is still important for individuals to understand their rights and options under the law. In this case, while the appeal was dismissed, the appellant still had the option to file an appeal before the appropriate authority in accordance with the law.
