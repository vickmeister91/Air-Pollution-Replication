The Madras High Court recently heard two writ appeals by Gestamp Sungwoo Hitech (Chennai) Pvt. Ltd. against an order made in W.P.Nos.19138 of 2013 and 26553 of 2014. The order directed the Government of Tamil Nadu to refer the matter to the competent Industrial forum and also directed the concerned Industrial forum to dispose of the matter within a period of three months thereafter and till such disposal, granted status quo as prevalent at the time of passing of the interim order. The court found that the writ jurisdiction was exercised to protect the interest of the workmen and directed the Government to refer the matter to the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal for adjudication and also issued a time-bound direction for disposal of the dispute. The court also held that if the terms of a contract are violated, ordinarily, the remedy is not a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court order discusses the legality of dismissing or terminating an employee without the approval of the authority under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The court directs the government to refer the matter to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication and orders that there should be no termination until a decision is made. The court also clarifies that while the extension of protection not to take any coercive action is beyond jurisdiction, it is issued only under necessity. The court emphasizes that appropriate remedies are available to the association or workmen to move the Labour Court for such an interim order or injunction as the case may be.
