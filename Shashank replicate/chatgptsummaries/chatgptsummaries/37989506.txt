The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by three accused persons seeking to quash an order passed by a revisional court. The accused had moved an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) seeking to obtain the Income Tax return of the complainant to cross-examine her in relation to allegations of dowry given at the time of marriage. The court rejected the application, and the accused filed a revision petition, which was also rejected. The accused then filed a miscellaneous petition to quash the order, which has been dismissed by the court.

The court held that there was no ground to believe that any Income Tax return was ever filed on behalf of the complainant, and therefore, there was no justification to issue such direction under Section 91 Cr.PC to produce the Income Tax return. The court also held that the orders passed by the courts below were not found to be suffering from any infirmity in which the exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.PC is required to be made.
