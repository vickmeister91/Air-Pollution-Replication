The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Sheikh Akbar against the Inspector of Village Panchayats cum District Collector, Villupuram District and the Government of Tamil Nadu. The petitioner was removed from his post as President of the Murarpalayam Village Panchayat due to allegations of misappropriation of funds in the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREG). The petitioner challenged the order of removal and subsequent dismissal of his appeal by the government. The court heard arguments from both sides and rejected the petitioner's contentions that he was not primarily responsible for the maintenance of records and that he was singled out for action while others were not. The court upheld the order of removal passed by the Inspector of Panchayat and the government.

The court order states that action was taken against the petitioner under TNCS (D&A) rule 17(a) and similar action was taken against other officials. The court rejected the argument that only the petitioner was singled out and other officials were left out. The court also stated that the views of the members of the panchayat alone are not the deciding factor to take action against the President of the panchayat under Section 205 of the Act. The Inspector of Panchayat after ascertaining the views of the members of the panchayat is vested with a discretion either to remove the president or to drop the further action. The court rejected the petitioner's contention that the action of the petitioner did not result in any loss to the Government. The court also rejected the contention that the complainant himself has gone back against the complaint and hence the said complaint ought not to have been taken note of by the Inspector of Panchayat. The court held that the discretionary power vested with the authority shall be exercised by observing the principles of natural justice and supported by reasons.

The court order also discusses several legal cases cited by the petitioner, but ultimately concludes that the orders of the Inspector of Panchayat and the Government do not require any interference by the court. The writ petition is dismissed.
