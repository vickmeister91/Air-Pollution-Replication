Mahendra and Punya were convicted under Section 9/51 of the Indian Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine. However, the court has allowed the suspension of their sentence until the final disposal of the present petition. The court has ordered that their sentence will remain suspended provided they execute a personal bond and two sureties. They are required to appear in court on 11.6.2018 and as and when called upon to do so.

The Indian Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats, and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 deals with punishment for offences under the Act.

Mahendra and Punya were convicted under Section 9/51 of the Act for hunting a wild animal without a license and for possessing a firearm without a license. They were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine. However, they have now been granted the suspension of their sentence until the final disposal of the present petition.

The suspension of sentence is a legal provision that allows a convicted person to remain free during the pendency of an appeal or petition against the conviction. The purpose of the provision is to prevent the undue hardship and suffering that may be caused to the convicted person and their family if they are sent to jail pending the disposal of the appeal or petition. The provision also ensures that the convicted person does not suffer irreparable harm if the appeal or petition is eventually allowed.

In the present case, the court has allowed the suspension of sentence for Mahendra and Punya, subject to certain conditions. They are required to execute a personal bond and two sureties, which means that they have to provide a written undertaking that they will appear in court whenever required and that they will not commit any further offence during the pendency of the petition. The sureties are persons who guarantee the court that Mahendra and Punya will comply with the conditions of the suspension of sentence. The sureties are usually close relatives or friends of the convicted person who are willing to take responsibility for their conduct.

Mahendra and Punya are also required to appear in court on 11.6.2018 and as and when called upon to do so. This means that they have to attend court on the specified date and time and also whenever the court requires them to do so. Failure to appear in court may result in the cancellation of the suspension of their sentence and their arrest.

The court's order granting the suspension of sentence to Mahendra and Punya is a significant development in the case. It provides them with temporary relief from the sentence of imprisonment and allows them to remain free during the pendency of the petition. However, it is important to note that the suspension of sentence is not a final decision on the merits of the case. It is only a temporary measure that is granted to prevent undue hardship and suffering to the convicted person pending the disposal of the appeal or petition.

The final disposal of the petition will depend on the outcome of the appeal or petition filed by Mahendra and Punya. If the appeal or petition is allowed, their conviction and sentence will be set aside and they will be acquitted of the charges. If the appeal or petition is dismissed, their conviction and sentence will be upheld and they will have to serve the sentence of imprisonment.

In conclusion, the court has allowed the suspension of sentence for Mahendra and Punya, who were convicted under Section 9/51 of the Indian Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine. The suspension of their sentence will remain in force until the final disposal of the present petition, subject to certain conditions. They are required to execute a personal bond and two sureties, and to appear in court on 11.6.2018 and as and when called upon to do so. The court's order granting the suspension of sentence is a temporary measure that provides them with relief from the sentence of imprisonment pending the disposal of the appeal or petition.
