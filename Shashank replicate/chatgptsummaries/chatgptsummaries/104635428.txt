The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 requires Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for developmental and industrial activities. However, the government found that many EIA reports were deficient and required accreditation of consultants to ensure quality reports. To address this issue, the government issued an OM requiring accreditation with Quality Council of India (QCI) or National Accreditation Board of Education and Training (NABET) for all consultants working in the area of EIA. The OM also stated that reports prepared by consultants not registered with NABET/QCI would not be considered by the government after 30.06.2010. The Scheme was extended until 30.06.2011 for those who had already applied up to 30.09.

However, the validity of various orders related to the accreditation of EIA consultants was challenged by petitioners on the grounds that they were not published in the Official Gazette, and that the power to constitute an authority cannot be delegated. The court found that the orders were issued in exercise of the Central Government's statutory power to protect and improve the environment, and that they do not constitute an authority. The court also clarified that while rules made under the Environment (Protection) Act must be published in the Official Gazette, it is not necessary for all government orders related to environmental protection to be published in this manner.

The court order also stated that the Central Government has the option to make statutory rules or issue executive instructions in regards to protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing environmental pollution. The court upheld the Scheme of empanelment, which ensures that EIA reports are of the desired quality and standard, and excludes individuals as EIA consultants. However, the court directed that no application for empanelment should be rejected without giving an opportunity to the applicant to remove any deficiencies or meet any shortfalls. The court also allowed individuals to apply for empanelment and directed that a cooling off period of one year before a fresh application is made is not provided for in the Scheme.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of ensuring quality EIA reports for developmental and industrial activities to protect and improve the environment and prevent environmental pollution. The accreditation of consultants and the Scheme of empanelment are important tools in achieving this goal. However, the court also emphasizes the need for transparency and fairness in the application and rejection process for empanelment, and the importance of allowing individuals to apply for empanelment without unnecessary restrictions.
