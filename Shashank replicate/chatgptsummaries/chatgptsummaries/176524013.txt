The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Munne Khan against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal.

The court order directs the State to take steps to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of distributories and canals. The State and local authorities are directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. Compliance report regarding publication of notices imposing compensation or damages for contaminating water shall be placed before the court on the next date of hearing.

The court also directs the State to prepare a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the State fails to submit the scheme. The court further directs the State to remove all encroachments within one month and issue show cause notice to persons contributing to pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and recover the amount and deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund. The State is directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure.

The court has ordered the removal of existing structures in an area meant for maintenance of a canal as they are causing contamination of the canal water. The state has been directed to remove these structures and file a compliance report. The court has also ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court has directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court has suggested that the persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the NGT, which has already ordered that any person resisting the action of the State Authorities be directed to present before the NGT.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The court concludes that the writ jurisdiction is not barred by the availability of statutory remedies, but the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court should be followed. The court also emphasizes that the writ court should be extremely slow in entertaining any issue which is under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court has ordered that an appropriate application/representation be filed by December 31, 2016 in the Original Application Nos. 86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Until then, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone the delay and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the State can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition is disposed of.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Munne Khan against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The court has directed the State to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies.
