The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions related to allegations of pollution by tanneries. The first petition sought to quash a consent order issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in favor of a leather industry, while the second petition sought to prevent the establishment of tanneries in Perundurai due to concerns about damage to drinking water and agriculture. The court referenced a previous Supreme Court decision that issued several directions related to tanneries in Tamil Nadu, including the establishment of an authority to deal with pollution and the implementation of the Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle.

The court also imposed fines on tanneries and directed the closure of those that failed to obtain consent from the Board. The court order states that tanneries cannot be reopened without permission from the authority, which has the power to permanently close them or direct their relocation. The order also enforces government regulations regarding the establishment of new industries in prohibited areas and requires compliance with environmental standards. The Madras High Court is tasked with monitoring these directions and has appointed a special Green Bench to handle environmental matters.

The petitioner in the case is challenging the issuance of a consent order for the construction of tanneries in Perundurai, alleging violations of water pollution laws and the Precautionary Principle. The counter affidavit argues that the proposed tanneries are located outside the Prohibited Area and have obtained necessary approvals from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.

The court order discusses the establishment of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) for 25 member tanneries in Perundurai, Tamil Nadu. The plant will use a two-stage treatment system to address wastewater problems and ensure zero discharge. The CETP company has been furnished with proposals for stage I prepared by CLRI, a research institute for leather industries. The proposals for stage II could ensure zero discharge of effluent. The court has issued consent to establish the CETP company with certain conditions stressing the implementation of treatment systems as per stage I & II before commissioning of the CETP.

The court finds the writ petition challenging the consent order to be an abuse of process of the court and discourages such motivated litigation. The court also notes that public interest litigation should involve genuine public interest and not personal gain or political motive. The court order warns against the misuse of public interest litigation for personal gain or political motives. It emphasizes the need for genuine public interest and social justice in such cases. The court also expresses concern over the large number of frivolous petitions flooding the courts and wasting valuable judicial time.

The order dismisses two writ petitions and imposes costs of Rs.1500/-, while vacating the interim order already granted. The order is copied to various authorities, including the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the Union of India.

In summary, the Madras High Court has taken a strong stance against pollution caused by tanneries in Tamil Nadu. The court has imposed fines and directed the closure of tanneries that fail to obtain consent from the Board. The court has also established a Common Effluent Treatment Plant to address wastewater problems and ensure zero discharge. The court has emphasized the need for genuine public interest and social justice in public interest litigation and warned against the misuse of such litigation for personal gain or political motives.
