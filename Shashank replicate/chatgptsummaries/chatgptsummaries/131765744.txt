The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Manoj Dubey against the State of Madhya Pradesh. Dubey had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for producing the dying declaration of the deceased Shobha, which was recorded during investigation and is an important piece of evidence in the case. The trial court had dismissed the application on the ground that the evidence cannot be considered at the stage of framing of charges. However, the court allowed Dubey's revision and directed the State to file the dying declaration before the trial court within four weeks, clarifying that the statement cannot be used for the purpose of framing of charges.
