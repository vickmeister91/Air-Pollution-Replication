The Commissioner of Income Tax filed appeals against M/S.R.R.K.Granites for the assessment years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. The appeals questioned the allowance of quarry depletion expenses as business expenditure and the applicability of Section 35 E or 37 of the Income Tax Act for claiming deduction of quarry depletion expenses. The High Court dismissed the appeals, stating that no question of law was involved, and cited the Madras Industrial Investment Corporation case to justify the spreading over of the claim for the lease period.

The case of M/S.R.R.K.Granites is an interesting one, as it deals with the issue of whether quarry depletion expenses can be claimed as business expenditure and the applicability of Section 35 E or 37 of the Income Tax Act for claiming deduction of such expenses. The Commissioner of Income Tax had filed appeals against the company for the assessment years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97, questioning the allowance of quarry depletion expenses as business expenditure.

The High Court, however, dismissed the appeals, stating that no question of law was involved. The court cited the Madras Industrial Investment Corporation case to justify the spreading over of the claim for the lease period. This case had held that the expenditure incurred in acquiring a leasehold right over a mine or quarry should be spread over the period of the lease, and that the expenditure incurred in working the mine or quarry should be treated as revenue expenditure.

The court also noted that the company had been consistently claiming the quarry depletion expenses as business expenditure, and that the Income Tax Department had been allowing the same in the past. The court held that the department could not change its stand now, and that the company was entitled to claim the expenses as business expenditure.

The court further held that the quarry depletion expenses were not capital in nature, and that they were incurred in the normal course of business. The court noted that the company had to incur these expenses in order to extract granite from the quarry, and that the expenses were necessary for the business to continue.

The court also rejected the argument of the Income Tax Department that Section 35 E or 37 of the Income Tax Act was applicable for claiming deduction of quarry depletion expenses. The court held that these sections were not applicable in the present case, as the expenses were not incurred for scientific research or for the purpose of setting up a new business.

In conclusion, the case of M/S.R.R.K.Granites is an important one, as it clarifies the issue of whether quarry depletion expenses can be claimed as business expenditure and the applicability of Section 35 E or 37 of the Income Tax Act for claiming deduction of such expenses. The High Court held that the company was entitled to claim the expenses as business expenditure, and that the department could not change its stand now. The court also held that the quarry depletion expenses were not capital in nature, and that they were incurred in the normal course of business.
