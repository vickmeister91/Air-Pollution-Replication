The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed by Balvinder Singh against the Union of India. The petitioner had been issued summons under Sections 91 and 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 in relation to a case where he was the third accused. However, the court found that the summons was illegal and quashed it.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the summons had been issued without any specific allegations against the petitioner. The court noted that the purpose of a summons is to require a person to appear before the court in order to answer specific allegations against them. In this case, however, the summons had been issued without any such allegations being made.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the summons was issued. This was a violation of the principles of natural justice, which require that a person be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them.

In light of these findings, the court quashed the summons that had been issued against the petitioner. However, the court also allowed the respondent to invoke Section 93 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. This section allows a court to issue a summons to any person who is believed to have information that is relevant to a case, even if that person is not a party to the case.

The court's decision to allow the respondent to invoke Section 93 was based on the fact that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the investigation itself. The court noted that the investigation was still ongoing, and that there may be other persons who have relevant information that could assist in the investigation.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and the principles of natural justice. The court found that the summons that had been issued against the petitioner was illegal because it had been issued without any specific allegations being made against him, and without giving him an opportunity to be heard. However, the court also recognized the importance of allowing investigations to proceed, and therefore allowed the respondent to invoke Section 93 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
