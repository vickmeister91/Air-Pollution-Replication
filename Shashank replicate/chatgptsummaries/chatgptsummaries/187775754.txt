The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by M. Srinivasan against the State Election Commissioner and other officials regarding the election for the post of Vice-Chairman of Sedapatti Panchayat Union. The petitioner alleges that he won the election with 10 votes, but the fourth respondent, Mrs. Santhakumari, tore the ballot papers and disrupted the counting process. 

The court directed the respondents to produce the video-graphed CD of the election process, which confirmed the petitioner's allegations and identified Mrs. Santhakumari as the culprit. The court ordered the respondents to take appropriate action against her and declared the petitioner as the elected Vice-Chairman of the Panchayat Union.

In another court order, the incident during the counting process of an election for the Vice-Chairman of a Panchayat Union was discussed. The fourth respondent, Mrs. Santhakumari, was caught on video tearing ballot papers and throwing a tray during the counting process. The petitioner, Mr. Srinivasan, had received 9 votes while the fourth respondent had received 7 votes, with one vote declared invalid. 

The court finds that the fourth respondent's actions were illegal and against the principles of free and fair elections. The court also criticizes the police for not taking immediate action against the fourth respondent and emphasizes the importance of democracy and the rule of law. The court ultimately declares the petitioner as the elected candidate for the Vice-Chairman position.

In the third court order, the petitioner is declared as the elected candidate for Vice-Chairman of Sedapatti Panchayat Union, as he has established that he has got sufficient number of votes to declare him as elected candidate, apart from booth capturing and torn of ballot papers by the rival candidate. The court imposes a cost of Rs.50,000/- against the fourth respondent and directs her to pay it towards the State Election Commissioner. The criminal case pending against the fourth respondent is not related to this order. The subsequently conducted election is declared nullity.

These court orders highlight the importance of free and fair elections and the need to uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The actions of the fourth respondent, Mrs. Santhakumari, were found to be illegal and against the principles of free and fair elections. The court orders emphasize the need for appropriate action to be taken against those who disrupt the electoral process and violate the principles of democracy.

The court orders also highlight the role of the police in ensuring free and fair elections. The court criticizes the police for not taking immediate action against the fourth respondent and emphasizes the need for the police to act promptly and impartially in cases of electoral misconduct.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of free and fair elections and the need to uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The court orders also emphasize the need for appropriate action to be taken against those who disrupt the electoral process and violate the principles of democracy.
