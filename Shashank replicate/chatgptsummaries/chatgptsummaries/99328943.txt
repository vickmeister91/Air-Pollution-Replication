The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Rajendra Agrawal under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the JMFC, Gwalior in Criminal Complaint Case No. 4353/2013. The application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant for calling income tax returns and balance sheets of the respondent was dismissed. The court dismissed the petition as no illegality or perversity was visible in the order dated 22.07.2014 passed by the JMFC, Gwalior, and there was no reason to invoke the inherent power of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in favour of the applicant. The interim relief granted earlier was also vacated.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to first understand the background of the case. Rajendra Agrawal had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the JMFC, Gwalior in Criminal Complaint Case No. 4353/2013. The case pertained to allegations of cheating and criminal breach of trust against the respondent. Agrawal had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for calling income tax returns and balance sheets of the respondent. However, this application was dismissed by the court.

Agrawal had then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in the High Court, seeking to quash the order passed by the JMFC, Gwalior. He had argued that the order was illegal and perverse, and that the court had erred in dismissing his application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. He had also sought interim relief in the form of a stay on the proceedings in the lower court.

The High Court, however, dismissed Agrawal's petition. The court observed that there was no illegality or perversity in the order passed by the JMFC, Gwalior, and that there was no reason to invoke the inherent power of the court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in favour of the applicant. The court noted that the lower court had considered the arguments put forth by Agrawal and had dismissed his application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. after due consideration. The court also observed that Agrawal had not been able to demonstrate any error or illegality in the order passed by the lower court.

The court further noted that the interim relief granted earlier had become infructuous, as the lower court had already proceeded with the case. The court, therefore, vacated the interim relief granted earlier.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Rajendra Agrawal under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the JMFC, Gwalior in Criminal Complaint Case No. 4353/2013. The court dismissed the petition as no illegality or perversity was visible in the order dated 22.07.2014 passed by the JMFC, Gwalior, and there was no reason to invoke the inherent power of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in favour of the applicant. The interim relief granted earlier was also vacated. The court observed that the lower court had considered the arguments put forth by Agrawal and had dismissed his application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. after due consideration. The court also noted that Agrawal had not been able to demonstrate any error or illegality in the order passed by the lower court.
