The Bombay High Court is currently considering a case involving three different petitions from autonomous colleges and institutions in Maharashtra. The main issue at hand is whether these institutions are subject to the Fees Regulating Authority and its regulations. The court has heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order pertains to three petitions filed by autonomous colleges/institutions in Maharashtra, questioning whether they are governed by the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fees) Act, 2015. The factual position in all three matters is undisputed, and the court has heard them together. The court found a prima facie case and issued notice to the learned Advocate General, as there is a conflict between the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 and the 2016 Universities Act. The Petitioners have approached the court seeking a declaration that the Regulation Act of 2015 is not applicable to them.

The court order pertains to a petition seeking complete financial autonomy for autonomous colleges/institutions under the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994. The petitioner's counsel argues that the legislative intent was to grant complete autonomy in administrative, academic, and financial matters to autonomous colleges/institutions. The counsel also argues that the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 cannot be applied to autonomous colleges/institutions as they have been granted complete autonomy. The state's counsel argues that the autonomy granted is limited and subject to the provisions of the 1994 Universities Act. The court will have to determine the extent of autonomy granted to autonomous colleges/institutions under the law.

The court order allows for the commencement of diploma or certificate courses without university approval, the commencement of new degree or post-graduate courses with academic council approval, and the restructuring and redesigning of existing courses with academic council approval. The Regulation Act of 2015 is considered a special law for regulating fees in professional unaided colleges, while the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts are general laws. The autonomy granted to autonomous institutions cannot be taken away by the Regulation Act of 2015. The court refers to various provisions of the Acts and statutes to support its findings.

The court order discusses various sections of the Universities Act, including the definition of "autonomous college" and the process for granting autonomous status to institutions. It also outlines the establishment of a Fee Fixation Committee to determine tuition fees and charges for courses and programs offered by universities, colleges, and recognized institutions. The committee is composed of various members, including a retired Vice-Chancellor or educationist as Chairperson, the Dean of the faculty concerned, and a finance expert nominated by the Vice-Chancellor. The order also allows for colleges and recognized institutions to submit proposals for different fees, which will be decided by the Fee Fixation Committee.

The court order discusses the fee fixation committee's role in determining tuition fees and charges for courses or programs offered by autonomous colleges or recognized institutions. The committee must meet at least twice a year and make decisions based on prescribed norms. The relevant statutes under the 1994 Universities Act outline the composition and powers of the Board of Management of autonomous colleges or recognized institutions, including the ability to fix fees and raise resources through various means. The order also defines "Private Professional Educational Institution" under the Regulation Act of 2015.

The court order discusses the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act of 2011, which establishes a Fees Regulating Authority to determine the reasonableness of fees levied by private professional educational institutions. The Authority must consider factors such as the institution's budget and infrastructure facilities, and must communicate its decision on fees within 120 days of receiving the institution's proposal. Institutions may collect interim or adhoc fees while awaiting the Authority's decision, but may not collect fees for more than one year in an academic year. The fees approved by the Authority are binding on the institution and its students for the duration of the student's course.

The court order discusses the factors that the Fees Regulating Authority must consider when determining the reasonableness of fees proposed by unaided institutions. It also explains the concept of autonomy granted to colleges and institutions by the statutes, which allows them to conduct academic programs and examinations, develop syllabi, and issue certificates. The order also outlines the powers and duties of the Management Board, including the ability to fix fees and other charges payable by students. Finally, the order mentions the various methods by which autonomous institutions can raise their own resources.

The court order discusses the definition of "autonomous college" and "autonomy" in the 2016 Universities Act compared to the 1994 Universities Act, highlighting the absence of financial autonomy in the former. It also discusses the differences between Section 89 of the 1994 Universities Act and Section 122 of the 2016 Universities Act, particularly in terms of financial autonomy. The order also mentions the creation of a Fee Fixation Committee and its application to autonomous colleges and institutions. Finally, it defines "Private Professional Educational Institution" and "Professional Education" and discusses the functions and powers of the Fees Regulating Authority.

The court order discusses the conflict between two laws regarding the regulation of fees for unaided private professional educational institutions. The petitioners argue that the special law regarding autonomous institutions should take precedence, while the respondents argue that the general law should prevail. The court cites principles of statutory construction and notes that a general law will not necessarily repeal a special law unless there is a direct
