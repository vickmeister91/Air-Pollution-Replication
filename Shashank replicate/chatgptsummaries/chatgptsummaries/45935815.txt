The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Anil Kumar Purohit, which sought to quash and set aside orders passed by the trial court and revisional court. These orders had rejected Purohit's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for calling bank statements and income-tax returns from the complainant/respondent No.2 in a case filed for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The court found that the bank statements and income-tax returns were not required for a just decision of the complaint and the order was justified. The court's decision was based on the fact that the documents sought by Purohit were not relevant to the case at hand. The court also noted that the complainant/respondent No.2 had already provided all the necessary documents to the trial court.

The court's decision was in line with the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C., which allows a court to issue a summons to produce a document or an object that is necessary for the just decision of a case. However, the court can only issue such a summons if it is satisfied that the document or object is relevant to the case at hand.

In this case, the court found that the bank statements and income-tax returns were not relevant to the case and therefore, the trial court and revisional court were justified in rejecting Purohit's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court's decision was also in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a court should only consider evidence that is relevant to the case at hand.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of relevance in the production of evidence in a court of law. It also highlights the need for parties to a case to ensure that they only seek to produce evidence that is relevant to the case at hand. This is important as it helps to ensure that the court's time is not wasted on irrelevant evidence and that the court is able to arrive at a just decision based on the evidence that is relevant to the case.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Purohit's petition to quash and set aside orders passed by the trial court and revisional court was based on the fact that the bank statements and income-tax returns were not required for a just decision of the complaint. The court's decision was in line with the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. and the principles of natural justice. The decision reaffirms the importance of relevance in the production of evidence in a court of law and highlights the need for parties to a case to ensure that they only seek to produce evidence that is relevant to the case at hand.
