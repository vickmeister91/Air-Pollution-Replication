The court order pertains to a case of violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused, Gyashan and Dharamvir, were charged with violating sections 49 and 49(B)(1) of the Act, which is punishable under section 51. The prosecution presented evidence, including the recovery of uncured leopard and otter skins from Gyashan's possession. Dharamvir was acquitted, while Gyashan was convicted. The court considered the relevant provisions of the Act and the arguments presented by both parties before delivering the judgment.

In this case, the accused were found to be in possession of skins of leopard and otter, which are prohibited under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The defence counsel argued that the complaint was not filed by a competent person, and that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused. However, the court rejected these arguments and held that the complainant was competent to file the complaint, and that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court also rejected the defence's argument that the recovered skins were not sent for expert opinion, and held that a Wildlife Inspector can identify the skins. The court found the accused guilty and imposed a punishment under the Act.

The court order states that accused Gayasan has been found guilty of possessing leopard and otter skins without a license, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. He is convicted and will be sentenced on a later date. Accused Dharamvir, who owned the vehicle in which the skins were found, is acquitted of the charges against him, but a notice is given to him to explain why his vehicle should not be confiscated under the same act. The defense's argument that the accused were falsely implicated is not accepted by the court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference. The Act also provides for the appointment of Wildlife Inspectors, who are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act.

In the first case, the accused were charged with violating sections 49 and 49(B)(1) of the Act, which deal with the possession of wildlife products without a license. The prosecution presented evidence, including the recovery of uncured leopard and otter skins from Gyashan's possession. The court found Gyashan guilty of the charges and convicted him under section 51 of the Act. Dharamvir, who owned the vehicle in which the skins were found, was acquitted of the charges against him. However, the court issued a notice to him to explain why his vehicle should not be confiscated under the Act.

In the second case, the accused were found to be in possession of skins of leopard and otter, which are prohibited under the Act.
