The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Balaghat in Criminal Revision No.10/2018. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 451/457 of Cr.P.C. for getting interim custody of a vehicle seized by forest officials in P.O.R. No.1664/2018 registered at forest circle Adhikari Khapa, Buffer Zone, Kanha Tiger Reserve Baihar, District Balaghat for the offence punishable under section 39(3) (a), 51, 48-A/51, 9/51, 52/51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court found that there was no evidence on record to show that forest officials started confiscation proceedings regarding the seized property and that the learned trial court cannot deny to give interim custody of the seized property only on the ground that according to Section 39 of Wild Life Protection Act, the seized property shall be the property of the State Government. The court order allows for the interim release of a seized vehicle to its registered owner during the pendency of a criminal case, despite the property being the property of the state government according to the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court found that keeping the vehicle in idle condition in the forest office for a long period could result in damage, and that the trial court and revisional court made a mistake in not giving the vehicle to its owner. The release is subject to certain conditions, including producing the vehicle before the trial court when directed to do so and not using it for any unlawful purpose.
