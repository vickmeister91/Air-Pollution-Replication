In a recent court order, a writ petition filed by a group of individuals against the State of Karnataka and various officials regarding the allocation of land for a solid waste treatment plant was dismissed. The court found that the land had been granted for this purpose in 2003 and that the petitioners had not pursued due diligence in being aware of this allocation. 

The petitioners had alleged that the land allocated for the solid waste treatment plant was in violation of environmental laws and that the plant was causing pollution in the surrounding areas. However, the court found that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claims and that they had not taken any steps to verify the legality of the land allocation before filing the petition.

The court also noted that the petitioners had delayed in filing the petition, as the land had been allocated for the solid waste treatment plant almost two decades ago. The court dismissed the petition on the grounds of delay, stating that the petitioners had not shown any valid reason for the delay in filing the petition.

However, the court granted the petitioners the liberty to initiate fresh proceedings if they believed that pollution control measures were not being complied with. This means that the petitioners can file a fresh petition if they have evidence to support their claims that the solid waste treatment plant is causing pollution in the surrounding areas and that pollution control measures are not being followed.

The court order highlights the importance of due diligence before filing a petition and the need for evidence to support claims made in the petition. It also emphasizes the need for timely filing of petitions and the importance of valid reasons for any delay in filing.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder to individuals and organizations to be aware of the legal status of land allocations before filing petitions and to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. It also highlights the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for valid reasons for any delay in filing.
