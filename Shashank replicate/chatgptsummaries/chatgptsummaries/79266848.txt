The Madras High Court recently heard two Criminal Original Petitions that sought to quash private complaints in S.T.C.No.68 of 2012 and S.T.C.No.71 of 2012, respectively, for offenses under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The issue at hand was whether a Public Charitable Trust is a juristic person and a company in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The petitioners argued that the first accused, a public charitable trust, is not a person or a company and therefore cannot be prosecuted. The court requested Senior Counsel to assist in the case, and after hearing both sides, the court disposed of the case with a common order.

The court order discusses whether a Hindu deity can be treated as a unit of assessment under the Income Tax Act. The court refers to previous cases and definitions of a trust as an artificial person with legal status. The court concludes that a public charitable trust is a juristic person and can be sued or prosecuted. The court also clarifies that a trust can be punished for an offense committed under the Negotiable Instruments Act, but only with a fine or compensation. The court also discusses whether a trust is a company in terms of Section 141 of the Act.

The court order states that a public charitable trust can be punished for an offense committed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, but only with a fine or compensation. The court also examines whether a trust is a company in terms of Section 141 of the Act and concludes that a trust is not a body corporate, firm, or association of individuals as enumerated in Section 141. The court rejects the argument that the legislature consciously omitted to include trusts in the definition of a company and cites examples of other central penal statutes where the definition of a company is in pari materia with the definition in Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The court order discusses whether a trust can be considered a company under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court concludes that a trust with two or more trustees can be considered a company, but a trust with a single trustee cannot. The court also discusses the rule of purposive construction and how it should be applied in interpreting the definition of "company" in the Act. The court notes that the use of the words "means" and "includes" in the definition indicates that the list of entities covered by the definition is exhaustive and cannot be expanded by judicial interpretation.

The court order discusses the definition of a "company" under Section 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act and whether a trust falls under this definition. The court concludes that a trust with two or more trustees falls under the definition of an "association of individuals" and is therefore a company. However, a trust with a single trustee may not fall under this definition, which the court deems a casus omissus. The court applies the principle of casus omissus and reads the expression "Trust" into the interpretation clause of Section 141 of the Act, thereby bringing a trust with a single trustee within the definition of a company. The court also holds that every trustee in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the trust is liable for punishment for any offense committed by the trust under Section 138 of the Act. The court dismisses the petitions and appreciates the efforts of the lawyers involved.

In summary, the Madras High Court has clarified that a public charitable trust is a juristic person and can be sued or prosecuted. The court has also established that a trust can be punished for an offense committed under the Negotiable Instruments Act, but only with a fine or compensation. The court has examined whether a trust is a company in terms of Section 141 of the Act and concluded that a trust is not a body corporate, firm, or association of individuals as enumerated in Section 141.
