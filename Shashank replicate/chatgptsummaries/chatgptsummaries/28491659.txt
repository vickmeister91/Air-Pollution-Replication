The court order pertains to a petition filed by Shraddha Varshney and others against the Dental Council of India's decision to discharge 100 students, including 67 petitioners, from the BDS course for the academic session 2014-2015. The reason for the discharge was that the students were admitted solely on the basis of their marks in the Class 12th examination, without appearing for the mandatory competitive exam. The court upheld the Dental Council of India's regulations that make it mandatory for candidates to appear and pass the competitive exam for admission to the BDS course. The court also noted that the Dental Council of India is the supreme authority for admission to courses recognized by it, including the BDS course.

The court order states that students who have been provisionally admitted to the BDS course without passing the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) have been granted admission unlawfully. The court holds that the cancellation of their admissions is justified, and the students have no legal right to challenge the decision. The court also cites previous cases to explain that a violation of natural justice does not always lead to nullification of an order if no prejudice has been caused. The court further clarifies that an interim order granting relief to the students is of no use as it is interlocutory in nature. Finally, the court rejects the argument that the college authorities can fill vacant seats based on the Class XII examination results, as the amended Regulations of 2007 require passing the NEET as a prerequisite for admission to the BDS course.

The court order states that after two rounds of centralized counseling based on merit, if seats remain vacant, the respective college authorities can fill them based on the marks obtained in the qualifying examination, but this provision does not apply to MBBS and BDS courses. The petitioners' grounds for relief are deemed untenable, and granting relief would encourage undeserving individuals to become doctors, endangering lives. An application seeking rehearing of the writ petition is rejected, and the petition is dismissed at the admission stage with no cost.

In summary, the court order pertains to the admission of students to the BDS course for the academic session 2014-2015. The court upheld the Dental Council of India's regulations that make it mandatory for candidates to appear and pass the competitive exam for admission to the BDS course. The court also held that students who have been provisionally admitted to the BDS course without passing the NEET have been granted admission unlawfully and have no legal right to challenge the decision. The court further clarified that an interim order granting relief to the students is of no use as it is interlocutory in nature. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the college authorities can fill vacant seats based on the Class XII examination results, as the amended Regulations of 2007 require passing the NEET as a prerequisite for admission to the BDS course.
