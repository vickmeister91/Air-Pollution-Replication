The Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949, prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Gujarat. The Act provides for stringent punishment for those who violate its provisions. Section 65 E of the Act deals with the punishment for the possession of liquor in excess of the prescribed limit. Section 81 of the Act deals with the punishment for the manufacture, sale, or possession of any intoxicant or liquor in contravention of the provisions of the Act. Section 98 (2) of the Act deals with the punishment for the abetment of any offence punishable under the Act.

The grant of bail is a discretionary power vested in the courts. The courts have to balance the interests of the accused with those of the society while deciding on the grant of bail. The courts have to ensure that the accused does not abscond or tamper with the evidence while on bail. The courts also have to ensure that the accused does not commit any further offence while on bail.

In the present case, the court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant is a driver with no criminal antecedent. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the offences alleged against the applicant are non-violent in nature. The court has, therefore, granted bail to the applicant on certain conditions.

The condition of executing a solvent surety of Rs.25,000/- is a common condition for the grant of bail. The surety is required to ensure that the accused appears before the court whenever required. The surety is also required to ensure that the accused does not abscond or tamper with the evidence while on bail.

The condition of surrendering the passport is also a common condition for the grant of bail. The passport is surrendered to ensure that the accused does not flee the country while on bail. The surrender of the passport is also required to ensure that the accused does not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses while on bail.

The court has also made it clear that the trial court is at liberty to issue a warrant or take appropriate action if any of the conditions are breached. This is to ensure that the accused does not violate any of the conditions imposed by the court while on bail.

The court has also made it clear that the observations made by it at this stage should not influence the trial court's decision. This is to ensure that the trial court decides the case on its merits and without being influenced by any extraneous factors.

In conclusion, the court has granted regular bail to Dineshbhai Mithailal Gautam in connection with a case registered against him for offences punishable under Sections 65 E, 81 and 98 (2) of the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The applicant is a driver with no criminal antecedent and has been ordered to be released on regular bail on certain conditions, including executing a solvent surety of Rs.25,000/- and surrendering his passport. The trial court has been given the liberty to issue a warrant or take appropriate action if any of the conditions are breached. The court has also made it clear that the observations made by it at this stage should not influence the trial court's decision.
