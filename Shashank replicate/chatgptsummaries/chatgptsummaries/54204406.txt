The National Green Tribunal had passed an order restraining the entire state of Punjab from cutting and felling any tree. Amanpreet Kaur, the petitioner, sought to quash this order on the grounds that it had been passed without taking into account the projects that had been officially cleared and had requisite sanctions given by the State of Punjab. The court issued notice to the respondents and proposed to dispose of the writ petition in terms of the order passed by the Supreme Court of India in an appeal arising out of the same order dated 19.05.2016 passed by the learned Tribunal.

The Supreme Court suspended the impugned order for a period of four months from 28.10.2016 to enable the State Government to execute the ongoing project mentioned above but also the other projects which are likely to be affected by the impugned order. The court order states that the operation of the impugned order passed by the learned Tribunal shall remain suspended for four months from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order. This is to enable the petitioner to execute the ongoing project and the learned Tribunal is given liberty to pass any fresh order for the project upon consideration of the facts furnished by the parties. The parties are also given liberty to approach the learned Tribunal to raise all such contentions as may be open to them in law. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.

The court's decision to suspend the National Green Tribunal's order for four months is a significant development for the State of Punjab. The order had restrained the entire state from cutting and felling any tree, which would have had a significant impact on ongoing projects and future development plans. The court's decision to suspend the order for four months provides the State Government with the necessary time to execute ongoing projects and other projects that may be affected by the impugned order.
