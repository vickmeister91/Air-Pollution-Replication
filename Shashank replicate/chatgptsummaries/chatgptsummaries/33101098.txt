The Mahadayi Bachao Abhiyan Tivrem Marcel, Gao and Anr. have filed an application regarding forest clearance for the Kalsa-Bhandura project in the Western Ghats. The court has directed the State of Karnataka and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to file affidavits stating whether any application has been made for forest and environment clearance, and if so, the status of the application. The matter will be heard again on August 17, 2017.

The Kalsa-Bhandura project is a contentious issue between the states of Karnataka and Goa. The project involves the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river to the Malaprabha river basin in Karnataka. Goa has opposed the project, citing concerns over the impact on the ecology of the Western Ghats and the livelihoods of the people dependent on the river.

The issue of forest clearance for the project has been a bone of contention between the two states. Karnataka has claimed that it has obtained all the necessary clearances, while Goa has disputed this claim. The matter has been taken up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Supreme Court.

In the latest development, the court has directed the State of Karnataka and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to file affidavits stating whether any application has been made for forest and environment clearance, and if so, the status of the application. This is a significant development as it will shed light on the status of the clearances obtained by Karnataka for the project.

The court has also directed the parties to maintain status quo till the next hearing on August 17, 2017. This means that no work can be carried out on the project till the matter is resolved by the court.

The issue of the Kalsa-Bhandura project has been a long-standing one, with both Karnataka and Goa taking a firm stand on the matter. Karnataka has argued that the project is necessary to meet the drinking water needs of the people in the Malaprabha river basin, while Goa has maintained that the project will have a detrimental impact on the ecology of the Western Ghats and the livelihoods of the people dependent on the river.

The matter has been taken up by various courts and tribunals, with each side presenting its case. The NGT had earlier directed Karnataka to maintain status quo on the project, but this order was later stayed by the Supreme Court.

The latest court order is significant as it will provide clarity on the status of the clearances obtained by Karnataka for the project. It will also provide an opportunity for both sides to present their case before the court.

The issue of the Kalsa-Bhandura project is not just a legal one, but also a political one. Both Karnataka and Goa have taken a firm stand on the matter, with each side accusing the other of acting against the interests of its people.

The project has also been a bone of contention between the ruling parties in Karnataka and Goa. The Congress government in Karnataka has been pushing for the project, while the BJP government in Goa has opposed it.

The issue has also been taken up by civil society groups, who have raised concerns over the impact of the project on the ecology of the Western Ghats and the livelihoods of the people dependent on the river.

In conclusion, the court order directing the State of Karnataka and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to file affidavits on the status of the clearances obtained for the Kalsa-Bhandura project is a significant development in the long-standing issue between Karnataka and Goa. The matter has been a bone of contention between the two states, with each side presenting its case before various courts and tribunals. The latest court order provides an opportunity for both sides to present their case before the court and for the court to provide clarity on the status of the clearances obtained by Karnataka for the project. The issue is not just a legal one, but also a political one, with both Karnataka and Goa taking a firm stand on the matter. The issue has also been taken up by civil society groups, who have raised concerns over the impact of the project on the ecology of the Western Ghats and the livelihoods of the people dependent on the river.
