In a recent court order, Raju, who was involved in a wildlife protection case, was granted bail on the grounds of parity with two co-accused who had already been granted bail. The court imposed certain conditions on Raju's release, including that he must not seek adjournments during trial, must appear in court on all dates, and must not misuse his bail.

The case in question pertains to the illegal hunting of a protected species of wildlife. Raju was one of several individuals who were arrested and charged with the crime. While some of the accused were granted bail earlier, Raju had been in custody for several months.

During the hearing, Raju's lawyer argued that his client should be granted bail on the grounds of parity with the co-accused who had already been released. The lawyer pointed out that Raju had no previous criminal record and was not a flight risk. He also argued that Raju had cooperated fully with the investigation and had not tampered with any evidence.

The prosecution, on the other hand, opposed Raju's bail application, arguing that he was a key player in the crime and that his release could jeopardize the ongoing investigation. The prosecution also argued that Raju was likely to abscond if released on bail.

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to Raju on the grounds of parity with the co-accused who had already been released. The court noted that there was no evidence to suggest that Raju was a flight risk or that he would tamper with evidence. The court also observed that Raju had no previous criminal record and had cooperated fully with the investigation.

However, the court imposed certain conditions on Raju's release to ensure that he did not misuse his bail. The court ordered that Raju must not seek adjournments during trial and must appear in court on all dates. The court also ordered that Raju must not misuse his bail in any way.

The court's decision to grant bail to Raju on the grounds of parity with the co-accused who had already been released is in line with the principles of natural justice. The principle of parity ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated equally under the law. In this case, since the co-accused had already been granted bail, it was only fair that Raju be granted bail as well.

The conditions imposed by the court on Raju's release are also reasonable and necessary. The condition that Raju must not seek adjournments during trial is important to ensure that the trial proceeds smoothly and without unnecessary delays. The condition that Raju must appear in court on all dates is also important to ensure that he does not abscond or evade trial.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Raju on the grounds of parity with the co-accused who had already been released, while imposing certain conditions on his release, is a balanced and fair decision. It ensures that Raju's rights are protected while also ensuring that the trial proceeds smoothly and without unnecessary delays.
