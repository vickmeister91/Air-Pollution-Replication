The court order pertains to a case involving the appointment of teachers and non-teaching staff at a school in Uttar Pradesh. The school was established as a junior high school in 1977 and was granted permanent recognition as a high school in 1983. The appointment of the petitioners was approved by the Basic Shiksha Adhikari in 1981, and they have been continuously working since then. However, after an inspection in 2001, it was discovered that some of the appointments were illegal, and proceedings were initiated to terminate the petitioners' services. The Director of Education passed an order terminating their services in 2007, but the petitioners challenged the order on the grounds that no proper enquiry was conducted, and the Director did not follow the rules of natural justice.

The court found that the Director had not conducted the enquiry himself and had relied on the report of the Deputy Director without giving the petitioners an opportunity to defend themselves. The court held that the order was illegal and violated the rules of natural justice. The court order states that there are requirements for procedural fairness when exercising public functions, including giving notice, consulting and receiving representations, disclosing information, providing an oral hearing, and giving reasons for decisions. The order in question did not follow these requirements, as the petitioners were not given a chance to make representations against the charge sheet and proposed punishment, and the Director did not provide a personal hearing before passing the order of termination.

As a result, the order of termination is set aside, and the petitioners are to be reinstated with all consequential benefits. The court's decision highlights the importance of following due process and natural justice in matters of public function. The court has emphasized that the principles of natural justice must be followed in all cases where the rights of individuals are affected. The court has also emphasized that the right to work is a fundamental right, and any termination of employment must be done in accordance with the principles of natural justice.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of the petitioners and ensures that they are not unfairly deprived of their livelihood. The court has also sent a strong message to public authorities that they must follow due process and natural justice in all matters of public function. The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on the functioning of public authorities and ensure that they act in a fair and just manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the petitioners and upholds the principles of natural justice and due process. The court has sent a strong message to public authorities that they must act in a fair and just manner and follow the principles of natural justice in all matters of public function. The decision is likely to have a positive impact on the functioning of public authorities and ensure that they act in a fair and just manner.
