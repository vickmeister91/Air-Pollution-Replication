The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board filed a suit for permanent injunction against the Chief Engineer of Bruhath Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike itself, to prevent them from interfering with the development of a park/garden on a property granted to the plaintiff by the government. The defendants had obstructed the plaintiff's work and blocked their access to the property. The defendants argued that the suit was not maintainable and had no cause of action. The court issued a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

However, in another court order, the court found that the plaintiff's demand for an additional road to connect to their property is not maintainable as the BBMP has already developed a park-cum-forest on the land. The court found that the plaintiff did not have lawful possession of the land and that there was no cause of action to file the suit. The defendants had undertaken the developmental work and completed it in January 2012. The court dismissed the suit and granted exemplary costs.

In yet another court order, the court discussed a dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants over the development of a park/garden on a 4-acre property. The plaintiff claims to have lawful possession of the property and the right to develop it, while the defendants argue that they have already completed the development and that the plaintiff has no authority to undertake any work. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide evidence of their alleged work on the property and that the defendants have provided evidence of their own development work. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not properly impleaded necessary parties and that the defendants are acting on the direction of the government. The court ultimately concludes that the plaintiff has failed to prove their right to develop the property and that the defendants' actions are not illegal.

In another court order, the court states that the plaintiff has failed to prove their alleged right to develop a park and that the government has directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to set apart 2 acres of land for the purpose of developing a park/garden accessible to the public. The plaintiff has no exclusive right to develop the park, and it is the joint responsibility of five government and statutory authorities. The plaintiff's claim that the BBMP encroached upon the land preserved for the park is not supported by evidence. The defendant has undertaken the work of developing the park as per the government's direction.

In yet another court order, the court dismisses a lawsuit filed by the plaintiff claiming exclusive right to develop a park on 2 acres of land. The court finds that the plaintiff has not proved their alleged right to develop the park and has failed to challenge the government's orders entrusting the work to the defendants. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not proved lawful possession over the land and has not provided cogent evidence of obstruction. The suit is dismissed, and each party is directed to bear their own costs.

Finally, in another court order, the judge lists the witnesses and documents presented by both the plaintiff and defendant in a case. The judge ultimately dismisses the plaintiff's suit and orders each party to bear their own costs.

In summary, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board filed multiple suits against the Chief Engineer of Bruhath Bangalore Mahanagara Palike and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike itself, regarding the development of a park/garden on a property granted to the plaintiff by the government. The defendants argued that the suits were not maintainable and had no cause of action. The court issued judgments in favor of the plaintiff in some cases, while in others, the court found that the plaintiff did not have lawful possession of the land and that there was no cause of action to file the suit. The court also noted that the plaintiff had failed to provide evidence of their alleged work on the property and that the defendants had provided evidence of their own development work. The court ultimately concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove their right to develop the property and that the defendants' actions were not illegal. In some cases, the court dismissed the suits and granted exemplary costs, while in others, each party was directed to bear their own costs.
