The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over the calculation and application of floor area ratio (FAR) for building construction in the state of Kerala, India. FAR is a measure of the total floor area of a building in relation to the size of the plot of land on which it is built. The first court order pertains to a dispute between builders and the State of Kerala regarding the calculation of FAR. The builders argue that the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 should be used to calculate FAR, while the State argues that other regulations, such as the Town Planning Act and Coastal Regulations Zone Notification, must also be considered. The builders also claim that a 1991 Structure Plan should not override the K.M.B.R. 1999. The court is asked to declare that the K.M.B.R. 1999 should be used to calculate FAR and to issue a writ of mandamus directing the relevant authorities to accept and consider building applications in accordance with the K.M.B.R. 1999.

The second court order pertains to a dispute over the floor area ratio for construction in the Central City area of Kochi. The government had promulgated a plan in 1991 that stipulated zoning and sub-division regulations and provided for control through floor area ratio. The plan had to be strictly followed in the construction of buildings within the area. The court held that the provisions in the sanctioned General Town Planning Scheme (the structure plan for Central City, Cochin) had to be complied with and would be binding for constructions in the planning area. The court also held that the changes in the floor area ratio as shown in an executive order could have been made only by a variation in the Town Planning Scheme sanctioned (structure plan) as contemplated under the Town Planning Act. The court denied the relief sought by the petitioners and lifted the interim orders passed by the court.

The third court order discusses a case where the government had granted exemptions for construction of buildings contrary to the approved development scheme. The court found that the government did not have the power to do so and cancelled the exemptions. The court also noted that the maximum floor area ratio specified in the structure plan of 1991 was the same as that permitted under the Kerala Building Rules 1984. The court considered the Kerala Municipal Building Rules 1999, which allowed for an increase in floor area ratio and additional FAR on payment of a fee. The court ultimately found that the government could not grant exemptions that violated the approved development scheme.

The fourth court order discusses the rules and regulations regarding the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in Kerala Building Rules 1984 and Kerala Municipality Building Rules 1999. The court notes that the deletion of a proviso in Rule 17(2) of the 1984 rules indicates that precedence is given to the 1999 rules over the master plan or detailed town planning scheme when it comes to FAR. The court also considers various rules and notes related to FAR and concludes that KMBR 1999 contains specific provisions regarding FAR and is a special statute in relation to FAR. The court also notes that an executive order clarifying the rule position cannot amend statutory rules. The court further discusses the proposal by the government to come out with a fresh plan and concludes that it may not help in redressing the grievances of the petitioners who have already invested on the basis of the clarification issued by the government.

The fifth court order pertains to a petition filed by private builders against the government's decision to vary the structure plan under the Town Planning Act. The court quashes the cancellation order and directs the government to reconsider the issue of floor area ratio in the light of observations made in the judgment. The court also directs the concerned authorities to consider all building permit applications submitted till a certain date and process them accordingly. The parties are to bear their respective costs.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to disputes over the calculation and application of floor area ratio (FAR) for building construction in the state of Kerala, India. The courts have considered various regulations and plans, including the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, the Town Planning Act, and the 1991 Structure Plan, in determining how FAR should be calculated and applied. The courts have also considered the rights of private builders and the power of the government to grant exemptions and vary structure plans. Ultimately, the courts have sought to balance the interests of all parties involved and ensure that building construction in Kerala is carried out in accordance with the law.
