The court order pertains to a writ application filed by Mohan Fireworks and others challenging a notification issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board fixing the maximum permissible noise level of fireworks at 90 Db [A] impulse noise at 5 meters from the source. The petitioners contended that the ban was not in conformity with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the court rejected their contention and held that the court has the power to issue directions to protect citizens' rights.

The court considered the adverse effects of sound pollution on human health and directed the Pollution Control Board to fix an appropriate noise level for fireworks after considering all aspects of the matter. The court also held that citizens' right to safety, health, and peace cannot be compromised for the unrestricted right to carry on any trade or business. The Pollution Control Board subsequently recommended a ban on noise-making fireworks generating more than 90 dB(A) impulse noise at 5 meters from the source, and the impugned notification was issued.

The court order states that the State Pollution Control Board has the power to issue a ban on the use of crackers as it falls under the definition of air pollution and environmental pollutant. The court also mentions that the National Committee of Noise Pollution Control had considered the noise standard of fireworks and recommended phasing out fireworks that generate noise more than 100dB (Impulse) at 4m. distance within the next two years.

The court upholds its previous decision to prohibit the use of fireworks and states that the principles of res judicata apply in this case. Res judicata is a legal principle that prevents a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court from being pursued further by the same parties. The court also addresses the difficulties pointed out by the petitioner regarding the transport of fireworks outside the state of West Bengal and refers to a previous case for guidance.

The writ petition is disposed of with the aforementioned direction. The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the adverse effects of sound pollution on human health and upholds citizens' right to safety, health, and peace. The court's direction to the Pollution Control Board to fix an appropriate noise level for fireworks after considering all aspects of the matter is a step towards reducing sound pollution. The court's decision to uphold its previous decision to prohibit the use of fireworks and apply the principles of res judicata is a reminder that legal matters cannot be pursued indefinitely.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the State Pollution Control Board in regulating activities that cause environmental pollution. The court's recognition of the National Committee of Noise Pollution Control's recommendation to phase out fireworks that generate noise more than 100dB (Impulse) at 4m. distance within the next two years is a step towards reducing noise pollution.

In conclusion, the court's order in the writ application filed by Mohan Fireworks and others is a significant step towards reducing sound pollution and upholding citizens' right to safety, health, and peace. The court's direction to the Pollution Control Board to fix an appropriate noise level for fireworks after considering all aspects of the matter is a positive step towards reducing sound pollution. The court's decision to uphold its previous decision to prohibit the use of fireworks and apply the principles of res judicata is a reminder that legal matters cannot be pursued indefinitely. The court's recognition of the National Committee of Noise Pollution Control's recommendation to phase out fireworks that generate noise more than 100dB (Impulse) at 4m. distance within the next two years is a step towards reducing noise pollution.
