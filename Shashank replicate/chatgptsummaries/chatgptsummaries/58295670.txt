The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hardeep Singh against an order dated 28.2.2012, whereby charge was framed against him under Sections 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 120-B IPC and Sections 212, 216 IPC. The petitioner had sought discharge from the charges framed against him on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence against him. 

The court allowed the delay of 155 days in filing the petition and dismissed the petition, stating that there was sufficient evidence against the petitioner for framing charges and he cannot be discharged merely on the ground of report submitted under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. The court also ordered the trial of the co-accused to be conducted together with the petitioner.

The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is an act that was enacted to combat corruption in India. The act defines various offenses related to corruption and prescribes punishments for the same. Section 13(1)(e) of the act deals with the criminal misconduct of a public servant who obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by abusing his position as a public servant. Section 13(2) of the act prescribes punishment for such an offense. 

Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code deals with criminal conspiracy. It states that when two or more persons agree to do an illegal act or an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is called a criminal conspiracy. Section 212 of the Indian Penal Code deals with harboring an offender. It states that whoever harbors or conceals any person who he knows or has reason to believe to be an offender, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Section 216 of the Indian Penal Code deals with harboring an escaped convict. It states that whoever knowingly harbors or conceals any person who has escaped from lawful custody, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In the present case, the petitioner had been charged under these sections of the law. He had sought discharge from the charges on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence against him. However, the court dismissed his petition, stating that there was sufficient evidence against him for framing charges. The court also observed that the report submitted under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the submission of a police report, cannot be the sole basis for discharging the petitioner. 

The court's decision to allow the delay of 155 days in filing the petition is significant. The law provides for a limitation period within which a petition can be filed. In this case, the petitioner had filed the petition beyond the limitation period. However, the court allowed the delay and considered the petition on its merits. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse decision is taken against him.

The court's order to conduct the trial of the co-accused together with the petitioner is also significant. This decision is in line with the principles of fairness and justice. It ensures that all the accused are tried together and that there is no discrimination or bias against any of them. This decision also ensures that the trial is conducted efficiently and expeditiously.

In conclusion, the court's order in the present case pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hardeep Singh against an order dated 28.2.2012, whereby charge was framed against him under Sections 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 120-B IPC and Sections 212, 216 IPC.

The court also ordered the trial of the co-accused to be conducted together with the petitioner. The court's decision to allow the delay in filing the petition and to conduct the trial of the co-accused together with the petitioner is significant and in line with the principles of natural justice, fairness, and justice.
