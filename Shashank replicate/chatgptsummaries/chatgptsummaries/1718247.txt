In a recent court order, the issue at hand was an ex parte decree that had been given against three defendants. However, one of the defendants applied to have the decree set aside. After discussing the case, the court ultimately decided to set aside the entire decree, as it was deemed to be one and indivisible.

The defendant who had applied to have the decree set aside argued that the court had no jurisdiction to re-open a decree that had already been pronounced in their favor after a contest. However, the court referred to previous cases and a Full Bench decision, ultimately concluding that it did indeed have the power to set aside the entire decree if it was one and indivisible, or if it was necessary to provide relief to the defendants.

As a result, the defendant's application was dismissed, and they were ordered to pay the costs associated with the case.

This court order highlights the importance of understanding the legal system and the various powers that courts have. In this case, the court was able to exercise its power to set aside the entire decree, despite the fact that it had already been pronounced in favor of the defendants after a contest.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision was based on previous cases and a Full Bench decision, indicating that the legal system is built on a foundation of precedent and established principles. This ensures that decisions are made in a consistent and fair manner, and that the rights of all parties involved are protected.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the legal system and the various powers that courts have. It also highlights the role of precedent and established principles in ensuring that decisions are made in a fair and consistent manner.
