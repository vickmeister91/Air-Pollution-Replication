The Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Anti-Social and Hazardous Activities Act, 1980, has been the subject of a recent court order. The order pertains to a writ petition challenging an order passed by the District Collector under the Act. The petitioner's husband was externed under Section 3 of the Act but violated the conditions and was convicted by the District Magistrate under Section 10 of the Act without a trial. The court found the order to be without jurisdiction and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, and quashed it. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the order passed by the District Magistrate was without jurisdiction. The court held that the District Magistrate did not have the power to convict the petitioner's husband without a trial.

This means that the authorities can still take action against the detenu if they follow the proper legal process. The court's decision does not provide immunity to the detenu from further legal action. The court's decision only quashes the order passed by the District Magistrate and orders compensation to be paid to the detenu for being kept in illegal confinement.
