The Rajasthan High Court recently heard multiple petitions from owners of stone crushers who were challenging two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke the consent to operate unless they were addressed. The Board then refused to grant consent and directed the closure of the units. The court allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter to the Board for reconsideration. The court also addressed the issue of an alternate remedy being available and the violation of principles of natural justice.

The court order discusses the powers of the State Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The order also addresses the right to file an appeal against an order, but not against directions. The court finds that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court due to violations of natural justice and fundamental rights. The Board argues that it was justified in relying on previous notices and replies from the petitioners, and that it had given cogent reasons for its decisions. The court ultimately upholds the writ petitions.

In another case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, the Board had issued an order to close down the stone crusher units due to non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court found that the Board did not follow the proper procedure for granting or revoking consent to operate, and the notice given to the stone crusher units was vague and unclear. Therefore, the court declared the Board's orders to be legally unsustainable. The court also emphasized the importance of following due process and giving clear and specific notices when taking action against industries for non-compliance with pollution control measures.

The court order grants a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that fails to comply with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher in question had deficiencies in its pollution control measures, but the Board did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders dated 04.02.2010, but directed the Board to consider the applications filed by the petitioners for renewal of the consent order and to inspect the sites to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government is also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has quashed orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board against stone crusher units due to violations of natural justice and fundamental rights. The court emphasized the importance of following due process and giving clear and specific notices when taking action against industries for non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court also directed the Board to consider applications for renewal of consent orders and to inspect sites to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. Additionally, the court ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones, with recommendations to be submitted within three months and necessary orders to be passed within one month of receiving the recommendations.
