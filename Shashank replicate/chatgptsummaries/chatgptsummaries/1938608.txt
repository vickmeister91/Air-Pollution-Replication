The Narmada river in India has been the subject of numerous court orders and disputes between the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan over the use and control of its waters. The construction of the Navagam Dam and the Sardar Sarovar Project have been the focus of many of these disputes, with concerns raised about their impact on the environment and the displacement of local communities.

One court order discussed the history and development of the Narmada river, including the disputes between the states over its waters. The case was referred to a tribunal to adjudicate the water dispute, and the State of Madhya Pradesh filed a Demurrer challenging the constitution of the tribunal and the reference to it. Another court order pertained to the water dispute between the states and the allocation of available water resources of the Narmada river between the four states. The Tribunal also directed for the constitution of an inter-State Administrative Authority and a Review Committee to ensure compliance with and implementation of the decision and directions of the Tribunal.

The expected benefits of the Sardar Sarovar Project included irrigation, drinking water facilities, power generation, flood protection, and protection of wildlife sanctuaries. The World Bank sanctioned the project, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India accorded clearance subject to certain conditions. The court order pertained to the approval of the Narmada Sagar Project in Madhya Pradesh and the Sardar Sarovar Project in Gujarat from an environmental angle. The court granted environmental clearance subject to certain conditions, including the completion of detailed surveys and studies, the implementation of environmental safeguard measures, and the completion of rehabilitation plans ahead of reservoir filling.

The court also addressed the issue of latches, stating that individuals or organizations cannot be permitted to challenge policy decisions taken after a lapse of time during which public money has been spent in the execution of developmental projects. The court noted that the tribals and weaker sections will not be the worst sufferers of the project and that the compensation policy is beneficial for them.

Another court order discussed the impact of the Sardar Sarovar Project on the environment and people. The court noted that the project is necessary for providing water to a growing population and improving agricultural productivity. The court also noted that the rehabilitation package for those affected by the project is beneficial for weaker sections of society. The court addressed concerns about environmental impact and stated that studies were conducted, but there were some deficiencies. The court ultimately upheld the project and its environmental clearance.

The court also discussed the resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) programs for those affected by the Sardar Sarovar Project. The court found that extensive preventive health measures and primary health centers were established at relocation sites for necessary health facilities. The R&R Sub-group and Rehabilitation Committee of Narmada Control Authority are responsible for applying their independent mind on R&R. The court also found that each state has drawn a detailed action plan, and the number of PAFs has substantially increased from what was estimated in the Tribunals Award.

The court order stated that the court should not interfere in policy decisions made by the government regarding infrastructure projects, as long as they are not in violation of the law or fundamental rights. The court should only step in if there has been a failure to act according to the law or in violation of it. The court should not become an approval authority for public projects and policies initiated by the government.

In conclusion, the court orders pertaining to the Narmada river and its projects have addressed various issues, including water disputes, environmental impact, and resettlement and rehabilitation of affected communities. The court has upheld the projects and their environmental clearance, while also ensuring that the affected communities are adequately compensated and rehabilitated. The court has also emphasized the importance of infrastructure projects for the larger good, while also ensuring that they are implemented in compliance with the law and fundamental rights.
