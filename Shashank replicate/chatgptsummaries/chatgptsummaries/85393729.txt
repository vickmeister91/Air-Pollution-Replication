In a recent court order, two government officials charged under the Indian Forest Act and Indian Forest Conservation Act were granted relief. The officials had argued that no action could be taken against them without the sanction of the State Government, which had not been obtained. The court found that the order against the officials was illegal and quashed it.

The case pertains to the alleged violation of forest laws by the two officials. The officials had been accused of allowing illegal felling of trees in a forest area. The case was filed against them by the forest department, which had claimed that the officials had not obtained the necessary permissions for the felling of trees.

The officials had challenged the order against them on the grounds that no cognizance could be taken against them without the sanction of the State Government. They had argued that the forest department had not obtained the necessary sanction from the State Government before filing the case against them.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, found that the order against the officials was illegal. The court held that the forest department had not obtained the necessary sanction from the State Government before filing the case against the officials. The court also held that the officials were entitled to protection under the law, and that no action could be taken against them without the sanction of the State Government.

The court's decision has been welcomed by the officials and their supporters. They have hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law and for the rights of government officials. They have also called for greater clarity on the issue of sanctions, and for the State Government to provide clear guidelines on when and how sanctions should be obtained.

The case has highlighted the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary sanctions before taking action against government officials. It has also raised questions about the role of the State Government in such cases, and the need for greater clarity on the issue of sanctions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for the protection of the rights of government officials. It underscores the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary sanctions before taking action against officials. It also highlights the need for greater clarity on the issue of sanctions, and for the State Government to provide clear guidelines on when and how sanctions should be obtained.
