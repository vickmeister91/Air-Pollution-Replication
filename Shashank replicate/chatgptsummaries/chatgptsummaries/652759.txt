In a recent court order, the appellant was found guilty of contravening Sections 44 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The charges were related to the possession of lion-shaped trophies made of Chinkara skins without a license. The court accepted the evidence presented by the Wild Life Inspector and upheld the conviction and sentence of 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50/-. However, the court modified the sentence and reduced the imprisonment period to the time already served.

The case was brought to the court after the appellant was found in possession of the lion-shaped trophies made of Chinkara skins without a license. The Wild Life Inspector presented evidence that the appellant had violated Sections 44 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The appellant was subsequently charged and brought to trial.

During the trial, the court heard evidence from the Wild Life Inspector, who testified that the appellant had possessed the lion-shaped trophies without a license. The court found this evidence to be credible and upheld the conviction and sentence of 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50/-.

However, the court also noted that there was no evidence presented to indicate when the accused had come into possession of the trophies. As a result, the court modified the sentence and reduced the imprisonment period to the time already served. The fine and default clause remained unchanged.

The court's decision to modify the sentence was based on the lack of evidence regarding when the accused had come into possession of the trophies. The court noted that it was not clear whether the accused had possessed the trophies for a long period of time or had recently acquired them. Without this information, the court felt that it was not appropriate to impose the full sentence of 6 months' imprisonment.

The court's decision to uphold the conviction and impose a fine of Rs. 50/- was based on the evidence presented by the Wild Life Inspector. The court found that the appellant had violated Sections 44 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by possessing the lion-shaped trophies without a license. The court felt that a fine was an appropriate punishment for this offense.

In conclusion, the court found the appellant guilty of contravening Sections 44 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by possessing lion-shaped trophies made of Chinkara skins without a license. The court accepted the evidence of the Wild Life Inspector and upheld the conviction and sentence of 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50/-. However, the court modified the sentence and reduced the imprisonment period to the time already served, as there was no evidence of when the accused came into possession of the trophies. The fine and default clause remained unchanged.
