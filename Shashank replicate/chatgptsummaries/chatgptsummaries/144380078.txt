The Karnataka State Government issued a notification under the Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation) Act, 1975, specifying the limits of Cubbon Park and excluding certain areas, including Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home. This notification was challenged by various individuals through multiple writ petitions seeking to quash the notification and preserve the entire Cubbon Park area. The court has taken up the petitions and is considering the matter.

The court order discusses a notification issued by the Karnataka government in 1998, which deleted a portion of the Cubbon Park area, including the premises of Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home, for the purpose of facilitating construction. The court examines whether this notification violates the Karnataka Parks, Play-fields, and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985, and other statutory or constitutional provisions. The court ultimately concludes that the exclusion of the area was necessary for construction purposes and did not violate any laws or constitutional provisions. However, the court notes that the government must still preserve and develop the remaining park area as a horticultural garden and improve its utility for the public.

The court order pertains to a construction project at the Legislators' home and the deletion of 30 acres from the park limits. The court states that public interest, particularly the provision of drinking water, must be considered, and efforts must be made to maintain the park. The court finds that the deletion of the area from the park limits is not arbitrary and that the power to delete or add to the notification is legal. The court dismisses the writ petitions and directs that no further constructions be made within the limits of the park specified in the 1998 notification without obtaining clearance. The State Government seeks permission to construct two reception counters outside the park limits, citing security concerns, which the court is yet to decide on.

The court order approves the State Government's request to make adequate security arrangements for Vidhana Soudha and adjoining buildings, including the High Court. The Commissioner of Police is directed to suggest security measures after consulting with the Registrar General. The State Government is not allowed to construct anything other than Reception Counters for the High Court building, and the layout plan must be implemented. The Chief Justice and Judge have been placed on the record along with the layout plan.

In summary, the court order pertains to the notification issued by the Karnataka State Government under the Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation) Act, 1975, specifying the limits of Cubbon Park and excluding certain areas, including Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home. The court examines whether this notification violates the Karnataka Parks, Play-fields, and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985, and other statutory or constitutional provisions.
