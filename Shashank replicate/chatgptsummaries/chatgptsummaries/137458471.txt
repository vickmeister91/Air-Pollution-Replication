The first court order pertains to a civil suit filed by Sh. Bharat Bhushan against the Government of NCT Delhi and the Managing Director of D.S.I.I.D.C. Ltd. The plaintiff had applied for an industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries but did not receive any information regarding eligibility or allotment. The plaintiff was later informed that his earnest money was being refunded without any reason. The plaintiff filed a suit for a mandatory injunction to hold him eligible for allotment of a plot and to relocate his unit from a non-confirming residential area to a confirming use zone. The court decreed in favor of the plaintiff and found that the defendant no.2 was a proper party to be impleaded in the case. The court also found that the plaintiff was eligible for allotment of a plot under the relocation scheme.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India regarding the removal of industries from non-confirming areas in Delhi due to rising pollution levels. The plaintiff, who runs a manufacturing business of PVC wires and cables in a non-confirming area, had applied for an alternate industrial plot under the relocation scheme but was rejected by the defendants. The court found that there was no justification for the rejection and ordered the defendants to provide an alternate plot to the plaintiff under the relocation scheme. The court also emphasized the duty of government functionaries to act in a fair and impartial manner for the welfare of the people.

In both cases, the plaintiffs were seeking an alternate industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries. The scheme was introduced to relocate industries from non-confirming areas to confirming use zones in order to reduce pollution levels in Delhi. The plaintiffs had applied for the scheme but were either not informed of their eligibility or were rejected without justification.

The court in the first case decreed in favor of the plaintiff and found that he was eligible for allotment of a plot under the scheme. The court also found that the defendant no.2, the Managing Director of D.S.I.I.D.C. Ltd, was a proper party to be impleaded in the case. The plaintiff was seeking a mandatory injunction to hold him eligible for allotment of a plot and to relocate his unit from a non-confirming residential area to a confirming use zone. The court granted the injunction and ordered the defendants to provide an alternate plot to the plaintiff under the scheme.

In the second case, the court found that there was no justification for the rejection of the plaintiff's application for an alternate plot under the scheme. The court ordered the defendants to provide an alternate plot to the plaintiff under the scheme. The court also emphasized the duty of government functionaries to act in a fair and impartial manner for the welfare of the people.

Both court orders highlight the importance of the relocation scheme of industries in reducing pollution levels in Delhi. The scheme provides a way for industries to relocate from non-confirming areas to confirming use zones, which helps to reduce pollution levels in the city. However, the court orders also highlight the need for transparency and fairness in the implementation of the scheme. The plaintiffs in both cases were either not informed of their eligibility or were rejected without justification. The court orders emphasize the duty of government functionaries to act in a fair and impartial manner for the welfare of the people.

In conclusion, the court orders in these cases highlight the importance of the relocation scheme of industries in reducing pollution levels in Delhi. The court orders also emphasize the need for transparency and fairness in the implementation of the scheme. The plaintiffs in both cases were seeking an alternate industrial plot under the scheme but were either not informed of their eligibility or were rejected without justification.
