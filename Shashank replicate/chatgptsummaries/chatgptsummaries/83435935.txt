In the first court order, the petitioner filed a writ petition challenging the validity of an order granting a prospecting license for iron ore to respondent No.4. The petitioner claimed that they had submitted an application for a prospecting license for mineral laterite much prior to the application made by respondent No.4. The petitioner also claimed that respondent No.4 had committed a breach of conditions and terms of the reconnaissance permit granted to them.

The court examined the allegations of malafides and found that the respondent No.4 was a defaulter and could not be extended any benefit under the Act or the Rules. The court also found that the respondent No.3 was not served notice of the writ petition and therefore, the allegations of malafides made against the respondent No.3 were not accepted by the court. The court held that the order granting the prospecting license to respondent No.4 was liable to be quashed.

Moving on to the second court order, the case discussed a company, respondent No.4, that applied for a reconnaissance permit to search for minerals in a specific area. However, it was found that some of the land fell within forest land and the Forest Conservation Act was applicable. The company was found to be a defaulter and not entitled to any benefit.

The petitioner, who applied for a prospecting license for a specific mineral, was found eligible and granted preference over respondent No.4. The court quashed the order granting a prospecting license to respondent No.4 and directed the authorities to refer the matter for approval of the Central Government for the petitioner's license. The court also noted that it has the power to strike down wrongs even if alternative remedies are available.

In both court orders, the issue at hand was the validity of the prospecting license granted to respondent No.4. In the first order, the petitioner claimed that they had submitted an application for a prospecting license for mineral laterite much prior to the application made by respondent No.4. The court found that respondent No.4 was a defaulter and could not be extended any benefit under the Act or the Rules. Therefore, the court held that the order granting the prospecting license to respondent No.4 was liable to be quashed.

In the second order, the company, respondent No.4, applied for a reconnaissance permit to search for minerals in a specific area. However, it was found that some of the land fell within forest land and the Forest Conservation Act was applicable. The company was found to be a defaulter and not entitled to any benefit. The petitioner, who applied for a prospecting license for a specific mineral, was found eligible and granted preference over respondent No.4. The court quashed the order granting a prospecting license to respondent No.4 and directed the authorities to refer the matter for approval of the Central Government for the petitioner's license.

In both cases, the court found that respondent No.4 was not entitled to the prospecting license due to their status as a defaulter. The court also noted that it has the power to strike down wrongs even if alternative remedies are available. The court's decision in both cases was to quash the order granting the prospecting license to respondent No.4 and to grant the license to the petitioner.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of following the rules and regulations when applying for a prospecting license. The court found that respondent No.4 was not entitled to the license due to their status as a defaulter and their breach of conditions and terms of the reconnaissance permit. The court's decision to grant the license to the petitioner emphasizes the need for fairness and transparency in the application process.
