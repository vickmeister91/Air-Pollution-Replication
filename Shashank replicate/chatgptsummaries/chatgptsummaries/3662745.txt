The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Riyaz against Mr. M. Shafi. The petitioner had filed an appeal against the judgment passed by the Presiding Officer, FTC, D.K., Mangalore in Crl.A.No.335/2005. The petitioner had failed to adduce evidence to rebut the presumption available under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had made an application to lead additional evidence before the first appellate court, which was not considered properly.

The court accepted the petition, set aside the impugned judgment, and remanded the matter back to the first appellate court for reconsideration of appeal and applications filed under Sections 91 and 391 Cr.P.C, subject to the condition that the accused shall deposit the remaining sum of Rs.7,50,000/- in addition to a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- already deposited with the First Appellate Court within a period of three months from the date of the order.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to understand the background of the case. The case in question pertains to a dispute over a cheque issued by Mr. M. Shafi to Riyaz. The cheque was dishonored, and Riyaz filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The trial court found Mr. M. Shafi guilty and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.10,00,000/-.

Mr. M. Shafi filed an appeal against the judgment of the trial court before the first appellate court. The first appellate court upheld the conviction of Mr. M. Shafi but reduced the sentence to three months and the fine to Rs.5,00,000/-. The petitioner, Riyaz, then filed a criminal revision petition before the High Court challenging the judgment of the first appellate court.

The High Court, after considering the submissions made by both parties, observed that the petitioner had failed to adduce evidence to rebut the presumption available under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Section 139 of the Act provides that in case of dishonor of a cheque, it shall be presumed that the cheque was issued for the discharge of any debt or other liability.

The petitioner had made an application before the first appellate court to lead additional evidence, which was not considered properly. The High Court observed that the first appellate court had not given any reasons for rejecting the application of the petitioner. The High Court, therefore, set aside the judgment of the first appellate court and remanded the matter back to the first appellate court for reconsideration of appeal and applications filed under Sections 91 and 391 Cr.P.C.

The High Court, however, imposed a condition on the accused, Mr. M. Shafi, that he shall deposit the remaining sum of Rs.7,50,000/- in addition to a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- already deposited with the First Appellate Court within a period of three months from the date of the order. The High Court observed that the accused had already deposited a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- with the First Appellate Court, and, therefore, the remaining sum of Rs.7,50,000/- should be deposited within a period of three months.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Riyaz against Mr. M. Shafi. The High Court set aside the judgment of the first appellate court and remanded the matter back to the first appellate court for reconsideration of appeal and applications filed under Sections 91 and 391 Cr.P.C. The accused, Mr. M. Shafi, was directed to deposit the remaining sum of Rs.7,50,000/- in addition to a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- already deposited with the First Appellate Court within a period of three months from the date of the order.
