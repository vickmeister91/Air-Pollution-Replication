The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions and a public interest litigation related to the construction of a sugar factory in Maharashtra.

The court provides a chronology of events and ultimately disposes of all matters in a common judgment.

The court order lists three writ petitions filed by different parties against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Collector of Solapur, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and other respondents. The details of the petitions and the parties involved are listed in the order. The court order also lists two writ petitions, one filed by Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd. and the other by Siddeshwar Navnad Wagaz, Shivaji Nanadev Surve, Amol Sakshan Chavan, and Balaji Mangal Patil.

The court order lists several cases involving Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. and various petitioners, including a public interest litigation and two writ petitions. The respondents include government officials and departments, and the cases involve issues related to sugar production and distribution in Maharashtra. The court order also lists the parties involved in two writ petitions, one from 2013 and one from 2016. The respondents include the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbar Raoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., the Union of India, and various government officials. The order also lists the lawyers representing the petitioners in each case.

The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates without financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, but only Audumbarraoji was granted one. They then began construction on their factory, but faced legal challenges from Grampanchayat Aashti and Mahavir Digambar Aware. The Collector of Solapur examined Audumbarraoji's permissions and allowed them to continue construction, but they were later restrained from further construction until they obtained all necessary permissions and certificates. Audumbarraoji applied for a certificate authenticating a change in the location of their factory, but faced objections from nine parties, including the petitioners in the present writ petitions/PIL.

The court order pertains to a case involving the setting up of a new sugar factory by Audumbarraoji. The Commissioner of Sugar had directed Audumbarraoji to obtain an aerial distance certificate from the Survey of India in respect of other sugar factories. Audumbarraoji obtained the certificate and the Commissioner of Sugar certified that the distance between Audumbarraoji's proposed sugar factory and existing sugar factories was more than 15 kms. However, some individuals filed writ petitions challenging the certification. The court order includes the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which deal with the setting up of new sugar factories.

The court order specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but who have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court will consider the objections of Lokshakti, who challenged the grant of aerial distance certificate to Audumbarraoji. The court will also consider the decision of the Division Bench of the court at Aurangabad in Gangamai Industries & Construction Limited vs. State of Maharashtra and Others.

The court order discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court refers to a previous case, Gangamai, which established that the Survey of India has the power to determine the minimum distance between sugar factories, and the Commissioner of Sugar cannot make a decision contrary to this. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was made earlier than Lokshakti's, and therefore the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting it to Audumbarraoji and refusing it to Lokshakti. The court also addresses objections raised by Lokshakti regarding the authenticity of Audumbarraoji's application and the timing of the applications.

The court order pertains to a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other.
