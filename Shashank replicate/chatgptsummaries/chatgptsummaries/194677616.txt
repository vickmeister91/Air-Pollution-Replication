The court order pertains to a challenge made by the petitioner against the excise policy/arrangement for the year 2011-12. The State Government had modified the previous year's arrangement and had adopted a new eligibility criterion for considering the tender for granting a license to supply spirit from bonded warehouses to retail sale contractors. The new criterion took into consideration 80% production capacity mentioned in the D/1 distillery license or two crores proof liters, whichever is lower.

The petitioner had challenged this new eligibility criterion on the grounds that it was arbitrary and discriminatory. The petitioner had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the court's intervention in the matter. The court, however, found that the scope of judicial review in the matter of policy decision was limited and permissible only to cases where it is found to be capricious, arbitrary, against the statutory provisions, or suffers from the vice of discrimination or is unconstitutional.

The court observed that the State Government had the power to modify the excise policy/arrangement and adopt a new eligibility criterion. The court further noted that the new eligibility criterion was not arbitrary or discriminatory. The court found that the criterion was based on a rational basis and was aimed at ensuring that only those who had the capacity to supply the required quantity of spirit were granted a license.

The court also observed that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate how the new eligibility criterion was discriminatory or arbitrary. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that the new eligibility criterion had a disproportionate impact on any particular group or section of society.

In light of these observations, the court held that no interference was warranted in the petition filed as a PIL. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for interference in the matter of the excise policy/arrangement for the year 2011-12.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the limited scope of judicial review in matters of policy decisions. The court has emphasized that the judiciary can only intervene in cases where the policy decision is capricious, arbitrary, against statutory provisions, discriminatory, or unconstitutional. The court has also emphasized the importance of providing evidence to support claims of discrimination or arbitrariness. The court's decision in this case reinforces the principle that policy decisions are best left to the discretion of the executive, provided they are based on a rational basis and do not violate any constitutional or statutory provisions.
