The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the proper service of legal documents, specifically writs and notices, to defendants in legal cases. In the first court order, an undefended suit for a loan account was brought to the court's attention, and it was found that the process-server responsible for serving the writs did not follow proper procedure. The court emphasized the importance of process-servers having complete knowledge of the laws and rules affecting the mode of service of writs. The court cited previous cases and emphasized that all available steps to effect personal service must be made before resorting to substituted service.

In the second court order, proper enquiries were required to be made to find the defendant, and the court emphasized the importance of following the rules for serving notices. The court discussed the amended rules for service by affixation and the need for accurate information about the defendant's whereabouts. The court also summarized the relevant rules for serving summons on a defendant, including the importance of serving the defendant in person and the specific rules for serving on behalf of the defendant. The court noted that service on an agent must be done in accordance with Order 3 Rule 6 and that verbal authority is not enough. The court also discussed the rules for service on a manager or agent in charge of business or work, an agent in charge of immovable property, and an adult male member of the defendant's family residing with him.

The third court order discussed the correct modes of service for legal documents. It stated that service can only be made when the defendant is absent from their residence and cannot be found within a reasonable time. Service can be made on an adult male member of the defendant's family residing with them, but not on a female member or a servant. Service on a pleader of the defendant is considered good service. Service by affixation is only valid under certain circumstances, such as when the defendant is absent from their residence. Service on a partnership firm must be made on a partner or a manager in control of the business with the direction of the court. Service on a corporation can be made on the secretary, director, or principal officer, or by leaving or sending it to the registered office or place of business. The court found that the service in this case was not in accordance with the law and ordered a fresh Writ of Summons to be issued for proper service.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of proper service of legal documents and the need for process-servers to have complete knowledge of the laws and rules affecting the mode of service of writs. The court also stresses the importance of making all available steps to effect personal service before resorting to substituted service.
