The Kerala High Court recently passed a court order in relation to two bail applications filed under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by accused persons in a case related to the trapping and slaughter of a Sambar deer, an endangered animal, in a forest range in Kerala. The court denied the bail applications and directed the accused to surrender to the investigating officer within seven days and cooperate with the investigation. The court also stated that if the accused apply for regular bail after surrendering, it will be considered and decided on its merits.

The case in question involves the trapping and slaughter of a Sambar deer, which is an endangered animal, in a forest range in Kerala. The accused persons were allegedly involved in the illegal trapping and slaughter of the deer, and were subsequently arrested by the forest department. The accused persons then filed two bail applications under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking bail on the grounds that they were not involved in the illegal trapping and slaughter of the deer.

The court, however, denied the bail applications and directed the accused persons to surrender to the investigating officer within seven days and cooperate with the investigation. The court stated that the accused persons were not entitled to bail as the offence they were accused of was a serious one, and that there was a possibility that they may tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses if they were released on bail.

The court also noted that the accused persons had not cooperated with the investigation so far, and that they had not provided any information or evidence to support their claim that they were not involved in the illegal trapping and slaughter of the deer. The court stated that the accused persons must cooperate with the investigation and provide any information or evidence they have to support their claim of innocence.

The court further stated that if the accused persons surrender to the investigating officer within seven days and cooperate with the investigation, they may apply for regular bail, which will be considered and decided on its merits. The court noted that regular bail is a matter of right, and that the accused persons may be granted bail if they satisfy the conditions for bail.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the Kerala High Court in relation to the two bail applications filed under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by accused persons in a case related to the trapping and slaughter of a Sambar deer, an endangered animal, in a forest range in Kerala, denied the bail applications and directed the accused to surrender to the investigating officer within seven days and cooperate with the investigation. The court also stated that if the accused apply for regular bail after surrendering, it will be considered and decided on its merits. The court's decision was based on the seriousness of the offence, the possibility of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, and the lack of cooperation by the accused persons with the investigation so far.
