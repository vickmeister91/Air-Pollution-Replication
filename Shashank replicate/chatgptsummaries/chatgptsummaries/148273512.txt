The court order in question pertains to an application filed by the applicant under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against the order passed by the trial court rejecting the applicant's application under Section 91 of CrPC. The applicant is facing trial for rape and has sought the production of call details and messages exchanged between two mobile SIM numbers. The trial court rejected the application on the ground that the documents were not necessary for the just decision of the case. The court upheld the trial court's decision, stating that the applicant failed to show that the documents were necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The application was dismissed.

Section 482 of the CrPC empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Section 91 of the CrPC, on the other hand, deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In this case, the applicant had sought the production of call details and messages exchanged between two mobile SIM numbers. The trial court had rejected the application on the ground that the documents were not necessary for the just decision of the case. The applicant had then filed an application under Section 482 of the CrPC before the High Court, challenging the trial court's order.

The High Court, after considering the submissions made by the parties, upheld the trial court's decision. The court observed that the applicant had failed to show that the documents sought were necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The court further noted that the trial court had considered the relevance of the documents sought and had come to the conclusion that they were not necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also observed that the power under Section 91 of the CrPC is discretionary and is to be exercised by the court only when it is satisfied that the documents sought are necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The court further noted that the mere fact that the documents sought may be relevant to the case is not sufficient to justify their production.

The court, therefore, dismissed the applicant's application under Section 482 of the CrPC, upholding the trial court's decision to reject the application under Section 91 of the CrPC. The court held that the applicant had failed to show that the documents sought were necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial and that the trial court had rightly exercised its discretion in rejecting the application.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application filed by the applicant under Section 482 of the CrPC against the order passed by the trial court rejecting the applicant's application under Section 91 of the CrPC. The court upheld the trial court's decision, stating that the applicant failed to show that the documents sought were necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The court observed that the power under Section 91 of the CrPC is discretionary and is to be exercised by the court only when it is satisfied that the documents sought are necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The court, therefore, dismissed the applicant's application under Section 482 of the CrPC, upholding the trial court's decision to reject the application under Section 91 of the CrPC.
