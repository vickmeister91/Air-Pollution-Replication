The court order discussed in this case pertains to the limitations of the power vested in a Panchayat or its President in granting permission and issuing licenses for setting up and conducting an industry. The Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, and the Rules framed thereunder provide guidelines for the issuance of licenses. The court clarified that the Panchayat or President cannot arbitrarily refuse to grant permission or license by merely stating that it would be against the interest of the public. The decision of the learned Single Judge in Manjapra Grama Panchayat's case requires clarification. The court also stated that the Panchayat or President is liable to act on the positive certification from competent authorities and issue the permission or license unless bound by valid policy reasons.

The case pertains to the grant of a license to conduct a metal crusher unit to the writ petitioner. The Panchayat had initially refused to grant the license, citing reasons such as scarcity of water, adverse effects on agricultural property, and the traditional avocation of the members belonging to the Scheduled Caste Community. However, the Pollution Control Board had cleared the project, and the Green Channel Committee had also sanctioned the scheme.

The court directed the Panchayat to adopt a realistic approach and consider the application de novo, positively getting an assurance from the petitioner that all stipulations will be scrupulously adhered to. The court also directed the Pollution Control Board to extend the validity period of the consent to establish the petitioner's unit by one year. After the installation of the machinery and on being cleaned by the Pollution Control Board by issuing consent to operate the unit under S. 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, the Panchayat will issue the license to the petitioner subject to the conditions imposed by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and other authorities within two weeks of receipt of the said 'consent.'
