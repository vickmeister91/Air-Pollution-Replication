The court order in question pertains to a criminal case that has been delayed due to legal issues that arose during the course of the trial. The prosecution had made an application for summoning an additional accused, and a criminal revision was filed before the court against another accused. Additionally, an application has been filed for the production of a complete enquiry file.

The court has dismissed the case and expects the trial court to expedite the case and finish it with some speed. This decision was likely made due to the fact that the case has been delayed for some time, and the court is eager to see it resolved as quickly as possible.

It is not entirely clear what legal issues have caused the delay in this case. However, it is possible that the application for summoning an additional accused and the criminal revision filed against another accused have contributed to the delay. These types of legal issues can often be complex and time-consuming to resolve, particularly in criminal cases where the stakes are high.

The application for the production of a complete enquiry file is also an interesting development in this case. It is possible that this application was made in order to obtain additional evidence or information that could be used to support the prosecution's case. Alternatively, it could be an attempt to uncover any potential misconduct or impropriety on the part of the investigating authorities.

Overall, it is clear that the court is eager to see this case resolved as quickly as possible. The dismissal of the case and the expectation that the trial court will expedite the case and finish it with some speed is a clear indication of this. It remains to be seen how the trial court will respond to this directive, and whether or not the case will be resolved in a timely manner.
