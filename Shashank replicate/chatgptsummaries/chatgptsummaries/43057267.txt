The Patna High Court has recently issued an order in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 53998 of 2017, which pertains to a case involving the operation of brick kilns without following the procedure under section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court has ordered that the petitioners in the case be released on bail, provided they furnish a bail bond of Rs.10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount each to the satisfaction of Sri Rajiv Kumar Bharti, Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Patna city, Patna, within six weeks from the date of the order.

The case in question involves allegations that the petitioners were operating brick kilns without following the proper procedures under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Act is designed to regulate and control air pollution in India, and requires that certain procedures be followed in order to ensure that emissions from industrial activities are kept within acceptable limits.

The petitioners in the case had been accused of violating these procedures, and had been arrested and detained pending trial. However, they had filed a petition seeking bail, arguing that they were not flight risks and that they had cooperated fully with the authorities during the investigation.

After considering the arguments put forward by both sides, the Patna High Court has now ordered that the petitioners be released on bail, subject to certain conditions. Specifically, the court has ordered that the petitioners must furnish a bail bond of Rs.10,000 each, along with two sureties of the same amount each, to the satisfaction of Sri Rajiv Kumar Bharti, Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Patna city, Patna, within six weeks from the date of the order.

The court has also imposed certain other conditions on the petitioners, including that they must not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission, and that they must cooperate fully with the authorities during the trial. The court has warned that failure to comply with these conditions could result in the cancellation of their bail.

Overall, the order issued by the Patna High Court in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 53998 of 2017 represents a significant development in the ongoing legal proceedings involving the operation of brick kilns without following the proper procedures under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. While the petitioners have been released on bail, they will still need to face trial on the charges against them, and it remains to be seen what the outcome of that trial will be.
