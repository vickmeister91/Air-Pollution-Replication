The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the enforceability of foreign judgments in India. In one case, a Chamber Summons was taken out in an Execution Application seeking leave to execute proceedings against the original plaintiff/judgment debtor for recovery of a sum due to the defendant/decree holder. The sum was due as per a judgment passed by the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom in 1999, and final cost certificates issued in 2004 and 2005. The court reserved its order on the Chamber Summons and pronounced it on November 28, 2019.

In another case, the court order pertained to a foreign judgment from the UK that the Decree Holder sought to enforce in India. The Judgment Debtor opposed the enforcement, arguing that the UK judgment was not a judgment given on merits as required by Section 13(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The Judgment Debtor contended that the cost certificates issued in relation to the UK judgment were merely consequential acts of quantification of costs, and the decree itself did not satisfy the test under Section 13(b) of the CPC. The Judgment Debtor further argued that the UK judgment did not contain reasons, which is necessary to enable a party to raise any of the permissible defenses contained in Section 13 of the CPC. The court had to determine whether the UK judgment was a judgment given on merits and whether it satisfied the requirements of Section 13(b) of the CPC.

In yet another case, the court order discussed the enforceability of a foreign judgment in India. The petitioner argued that the order of costs granted in the foreign judgment could not be enforced as the primary judgment was not given on merits. The respondent argued that the order of costs was executable in India as it was a decree for payment of a sum of money and had attained finality. The court examined the legal position and concluded that for a foreign judgment to be conclusive, the court must have directly adjudicated upon the matter before it, and the final adjudication is what is conclusive, not the reasons. The court also noted that costs must follow the event, but if the primary judgment does not pass the test of a judgment on merits, an order of costs cannot have an independent existence dehors the primary judgment.

In another case, the court order discussed the executability of a foreign judgment in India. The court cited Section 13 and Section 44A of the CPC and explained that a foreign judgment is conclusive as long as it has been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction, given on the merits of the case, and not opposed to natural justice. The court also cited various cases to support its decision that an order for payment of costs is executable under Section 44A of the CPC and that objections raised by the Judgment Debtor are untenable. The court ultimately allowed the Chamber Summons as prayed.

In yet another case, the court order stated that a judgment on costs, which was accepted by both parties, is binding and conclusive. The judgment was made after a trial where evidence was presented, and the parties were given an opportunity to present their case. The court rejected the argument that a foreign judgment must contain reasons to be executable and that the judgment in question did not disclose application of mind or consideration of evidence. The court held that the order for payment of costs is executable as a decree under Section 44A of the CPC.

Finally, in another case, the court order stated that an order for payment of costs can be executed as a decree under Section 44A of the CPC. The judgment debtor cannot challenge the judgment passed against them after accepting its finality and conclusiveness. The objection raised by the judgment debtor to the executability and enforceability of the foreign judgment fails. The objection regarding the award of costs of the proceedings for assessment of cost is rejected. The order of the costs is a judgment and decree which can be said to be conclusive and binding. The Chamber Summons is made absolute in terms of prayer clause (a), and the Decree Holder is granted leave to execute the judgment. The application for a stay of this order and judgment is rejected.

In summary, these court orders all deal with the enforceability of foreign judgments in India. The courts have cited various sections of the CPC and previous cases to support their decisions, ultimately allowing the Chamber Summons as prayed and granting leave to execute the judgments. The courts have also held that for a foreign judgment to be conclusive, the court must have directly adjudicated upon the matter before it, and the final adjudication is what is conclusive, not the reasons. Additionally, the courts have held that an order for payment of costs is executable under Section 44A of the CPC and that objections raised by the Judgment Debtor are untenable. Overall, these court orders provide guidance on the enforceability of foreign judgments in India and the legal requirements that must be met for such judgments to be considered conclusive and binding.
