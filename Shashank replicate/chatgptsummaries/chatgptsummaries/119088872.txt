The High Court of Kerala in Ernakulam recently issued two court orders related to the use of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The first case involved a challenge to the rejection of a proposal to divert forest land for the construction of a pump house and irrigation canal. The legal heirs of Joseph Kurian, who owned agricultural land in Malayattoor Village, filed the case. The court dismissed the case, upholding the rejection of the proposal due to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which restricts the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court also noted that the grant of lease of forest land for non-forestry purposes must cater to the larger interest of the community and nation.

The second case pertained to a petitioner seeking a lease of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The court dismissed the petitioner's claim, stating that they had no legal right to the land. The court examined the Forest (Conservation) Act, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for any assignment of forest land to private individuals or organizations. The court found that the government had issued an order (Ext.P7) that was contrary to the provisions of the Act and set it aside. The court directed the government to reconsider the proposal and pass fresh orders within six months, while an interim order would remain in force until then.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a crucial piece of legislation that regulates the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act aims to protect forests and wildlife by restricting the use of forest land for non-forest purposes, such as mining, industrial projects, and infrastructure development. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act also mandates that any diversion of forest land must be compensated by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.

The court's decision is in line with the objectives of the Act, which seeks to protect forests and wildlife and ensure sustainable development.

In the second case, the court found that the petitioner had no legal right to the forest land in question. The court examined the Forest (Conservation) Act, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for any assignment of forest land to private individuals or organizations. The court found that the government had issued an order that was contrary to the provisions of the Act and set it aside. The court directed the government to reconsider the proposal and pass fresh orders within six months, while an interim order would remain in force until then.
