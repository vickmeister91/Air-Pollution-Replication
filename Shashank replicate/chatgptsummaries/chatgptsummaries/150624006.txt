The court issued directions for removing encroachments and noted the importance of preserving the three railway tracks in the state, including one declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.

The court directed the Pollution Control Board to inspect the site and issue orders for disconnection of electricity and water connections of the polluting units. The court also noted the absence of sewage treatment plants and mechanisms for processing municipal solid waste in the area and directed the Secretary (Urban Development) to file a separate affidavit on the issue.
