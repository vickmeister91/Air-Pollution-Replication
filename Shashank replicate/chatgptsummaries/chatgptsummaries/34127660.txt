The Madras High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by T.S.R. Vasudevan under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to direct the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to produce documents pertaining to O.A.No.383/2007 pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Chennai. The court stated that the petitioner, who is a party to the proceedings, should have obtained certified copies of the documents if his intention was genuine. The court also noted that the CBI is not a party to the DRT proceedings and is not expected to have any documents pertaining to it. The court dismissed the petition as frivolous and intended to protract the trial.

The petitioner, T.S.R. Vasudevan, had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking the production of documents related to O.A.No.383/2007 pending before the DRT in Chennai. The petitioner had claimed that the documents were necessary for the proper adjudication of the case. The CBI, which was not a party to the DRT proceedings, was named as the respondent in the petition.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner should have obtained certified copies of the documents if his intention was genuine. The court noted that the petitioner was a party to the proceedings and had the right to obtain certified copies of the documents. The court also observed that the CBI was not a party to the DRT proceedings and was not expected to have any documents pertaining to it.

The court further stated that the petition was frivolous and intended to protract the trial. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain certified copies of the documents and had instead filed the petition seeking the production of the documents from the CBI. The court observed that the petitioner had not provided any valid reason for seeking the production of the documents from the CBI.

The court also noted that the petitioner had filed several petitions in the past seeking the production of documents from various authorities. The court observed that the petitioner had a tendency to file such petitions and that the present petition was also filed with a similar intention.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition as frivolous and intended to protract the trial. The court also imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 on the petitioner for wasting the time of the court and for filing a frivolous petition.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court dismissed a petition filed by T.S.R. Vasudevan under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking the production of documents related to O.A.No.383/2007 pending before the DRT in Chennai. The court stated that the petitioner should have obtained certified copies of the documents if his intention was genuine and that the CBI was not expected to have any documents pertaining to the DRT proceedings. The court dismissed the petition as frivolous and intended to protract the trial and imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 on the petitioner for wasting the time of the court and for filing a frivolous petition.
