The court order pertains to a land dispute case where the plaintiffs claimed that they had inherited land from their deceased fathers and that the settlement made in favor of the defendant by the government was illegal. The trial court had dismissed the suit on the grounds of non-joinder of necessary parties and lack of evidence of possession by the plaintiffs. The first appellate court reversed the decision and decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiffs. The second appeal was admitted against this judgment.

The court order provides a detailed account of the facts and issues involved in the case and the findings of the trial and appellate courts. The court found that the learned trial court made an error in not disclosing whether the conversion of land was made by observing all procedures or not. The learned First Appellate Court found that there is cause of action for the suit and that the allotment of the suit land in favor of the defendant No.1 was not proper. The court also found fault in the decision of the learned trial court in regard to non-joinder of necessary parties.

The court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the learned trial court, and held that plaintiffs are entitled to get a decree as prayed for. However, the court found that the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence to establish their right, title, and interest with respect to the suit land. The court also noted that the land was made khas under Section 6(4) of the Act, and no appeal was made by the plaintiffs.

The court order states that the plaintiffs did not challenge the initial order of conversion of land into Government khas land under Section 6 of the Act, and did not appeal under Section 7. Therefore, the order passed under Section 6 continues to hold the field. The court also found that the settlement order and issuance of patta could have been challenged by the plaintiffs before the appellate forum, but they did not do so. As a result, the suit land is a Government khas land and has been allotted to the defendant No.1.

The second substantial question of law is decided in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs. The Second Appeal is allowed, and the impugned first appellate judgment and decree is set aside, and that of the trial Court is restored.
