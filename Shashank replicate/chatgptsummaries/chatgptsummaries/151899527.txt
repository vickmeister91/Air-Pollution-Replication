In a recent court order, Pappu, who was accused of offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, was granted bail. The court deemed that custodial interrogation was not required in this case. As a condition of his bail, Pappu was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount for his appearance in trial court. Additionally, the court directed Pappu to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The decision to grant bail to Pappu was likely based on a number of factors. First and foremost, the court may have determined that Pappu was not a flight risk and was unlikely to abscond if released on bail. Additionally, the court may have considered the severity of the charges against Pappu and determined that custodial interrogation was not necessary in this case.

It is important to note that while Pappu has been granted bail, he is still required to comply with certain conditions in order to remain free. Specifically, he must appear in trial court as required and must comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section of the code requires that a person released on bail must not commit any offence while on bail and must not interfere with the investigation or prosecution of the case.

Overall, the decision to grant bail to Pappu is a significant one, as it allows him to remain free while awaiting trial. However, it is important to remember that this is not a final verdict in the case and Pappu will still need to appear in court and face the charges against him.
