The court recently issued two orders in relation to the renewal of a lease of land measuring about 28.83.5 hectares equivalent to 71.22 acres in Minjur and Vallur villages in Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu. The lease was granted for a period of 99 years in 1905, and it expired in 2004. The legal heirs of V. Krishnasamy Mudaliar had filed two writ petitions seeking the renewal of the lease. However, the court held that the lease had lapsed on expiry of the time limit specified in the lease agreement and that the petitioners did not have a vested right to claim renewal.

The court noted that the lands were required for multipurpose government public schemes and had already been handed over to Chennai Corporation for solid waste management and composite yard. The court order stated that the petitioner's claim for lease of government land cannot be accepted as no person has a vested right to get any lease of government land. The lands were resumed for public purpose and the state government had taken the decision to resume the lands for such public purpose. The petitioner's submission was negatived as there was no arbitrariness nor was it a colourable exercise of power. The writ petitions were dismissed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the lease had expired and the petitioners did not have a vested right to claim renewal. The lands were required for public purposes and had already been handed over to Chennai Corporation for solid waste management and composite yard. The court held that the state government had taken the decision to resume the lands for public purpose and there was no arbitrariness or colourable exercise of power.

The court's decision is in line with the principle that no person has a vested right to get any lease of government land.

In conclusion, the court's decision in relation to the renewal of a lease of land measuring about 28.83.5 hectares equivalent to 71.22 acres in Minjur and Vallur villages in Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, highlights the principle that lease agreements have a time limit and expire on the expiry of the time limit specified in the agreement.
