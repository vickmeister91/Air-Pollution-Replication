The court recently granted bail to Aditya Goshwami, who had filed a bail application in relation to charges of illegal mining and possession of explosive substances. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately granted bail to the petitioner on certain conditions. 

Firstly, the petitioner was required to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of the same amount. This is a common requirement for bail applications, as it ensures that the accused will appear in court for their trial. 

In addition to this, the court ordered that the petitioner must deposit Rs. 20,000 with the District Mining Officer in Dumka and produce a receipt before the court. This is likely related to the charges of illegal mining, as it ensures that the petitioner will not engage in any further illegal mining activities while out on bail. 

The court also took into consideration the fact that the petitioner had been in custody since September 19, 2018. This suggests that the court may have felt that the petitioner had already spent a significant amount of time in custody and that it was appropriate to grant bail at this stage. 

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Aditya Goshwami was based on a number of factors, including the seriousness of the charges, the petitioner's previous time spent in custody, and the conditions imposed by the court to ensure that the petitioner does not engage in any further illegal activities while out on bail.
