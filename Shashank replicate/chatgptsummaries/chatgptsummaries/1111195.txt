The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by residents of village Burail who own agricultural land there, challenging the action of the respondents in not allowing them to draw sullage water (untreated sewage) from the sewers of Chandigarh Administration. The respondents had stopped the supply of sullage water due to pollution concerns and violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the petition had no merit and dismissed it.

The court held that the relations between the parties were governed by the contract itself, and any alleged violation of such a contract could not be remedied through a writ or order under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The court also cited a similar case where the use of sewage water for irrigation purposes was stopped due to pollution concerns.

The petitioners had argued that they had been using sullage water for irrigation purposes for the past 20 years and that the respondents had no right to stop the supply of water. They also argued that the respondents had not given them any notice before stopping the supply of water.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the use of sullage water for irrigation purposes was not only illegal but also harmful to the environment. They argued that the use of sullage water violated the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and that the petitioners had no right to use the water without the permission of the authorities.

The court, after hearing both sides, held that the petitioners had no right to use sullage water for irrigation purposes without the permission of the authorities. The court also held that the respondents had the right to stop the supply of water if they believed that the use of water was harmful to the environment.

The court further held that the relations between the parties were governed by the contract itself, and any alleged violation of such a contract could not be remedied through a writ or order under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The court cited a similar case where the use of sewage water for irrigation purposes was stopped due to pollution concerns.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the importance of environmental protection and the need to comply with laws and regulations related to the use of water. The court's decision also highlights the importance of contracts in governing the relations between parties and the limitations of writs and orders under Art. 226 of the Constitution.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the petition filed by residents of village Burail highlights the importance of complying with laws and regulations related to the use of water and the need to protect the environment. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of contracts in governing the relations between parties and the limitations of writs and orders under Art. 226 of the Constitution.
