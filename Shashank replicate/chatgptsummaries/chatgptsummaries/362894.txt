The Andhra High Court recently heard a petition filed by Medwin Hospital under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The A.P. Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the hospital for violating various sections of the Act, including discharging untreated waste water into the sewer line of the municipal drainage system, generating solid waste without proper disposal, and failing to obtain consent as required under the Act.

The hospital argued that they were not a company and that there were no specific allegations against them or their managing director. However, the court rejected these arguments and held that the hospital could be prosecuted under the Act, regardless of whether they were a company or not. The court also held that the authorisation given to the Environmental Engineer to prosecute the hospital was valid.

The court further held that the question of whether the managing director was in charge of the hospital was a question of fact that could only be decided after the trial. The court order states that Ameshwar Rao is not in charge of the hospital's management, but the prosecution cannot be quashed on that ground.

The defense argued that the criminal law proceedings were set in motion against the accused in a casual and mechanical manner. However, the court disagreed and stated that the magistrate must carefully scrutinize the evidence before issuing a process against the accused.

The court also discussed the burden of proof and vicarious liability. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove that the accused committed the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. Vicarious liability means that a person can be held responsible for the actions of another person if they have a relationship of control or authority over that person. In this case, the managing director could be held vicariously liable for the hospital's actions if it is proven that he was in charge of the hospital's management.

Ultimately, the court decided not to interfere with the proceedings and dismissed the petition. The hospital will have to face trial for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This case highlights the importance of complying with environmental laws and obtaining the necessary consents and approvals before carrying out any activities that may have an impact on the environment. It also emphasises the need for careful scrutiny of evidence before initiating criminal proceedings against an accused.
