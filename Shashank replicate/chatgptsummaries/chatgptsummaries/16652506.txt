The court order in question pertains to the case of Dhan Pal Nath, who was convicted of possessing a live cobra snake without a license under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court upheld his conviction and sentenced him to three years of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 4900. However, the court also took into consideration the fact that Nath was not a previous convict and did not engage in any such activity after the case was registered. As a result, the court modified the sentence to the period already undergone and the fine.

The case against Nath was registered in 2015 when he was caught with a live cobra snake in his possession. The police had received a tip-off about Nath's activities and had conducted a raid at his residence. During the raid, they found the live cobra snake in a glass jar. Nath was subsequently arrested and charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Nath had been in possession of the live cobra snake without a license. The defense argued that Nath had found the snake in his garden and had intended to release it back into the wild. However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be more credible and convicted Nath of the offense.

Following his conviction, Nath appealed the decision in the higher court. However, the appeal was dismissed, and the trial court record was returned. The court upheld Nath's conviction and sentence but modified the sentence to the period already undergone and the fine.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or capturing of wild animals without a license. It also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal or its parts without a license.

The act provides for stringent penalties for offenses committed under its provisions. The penalties include imprisonment for a term that may extend to seven years and a fine that may extend to Rs. 25,000. The act also provides for the forfeiture of any property used in the commission of the offense.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Dhan Pal Nath serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting wild animals and plants. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that provides for the protection of these species. The court's decision to uphold Nath's conviction and sentence but modify the sentence to the period already undergone and the fine takes into consideration the circumstances of the case and serves as a warning to others who may engage in similar activities.
