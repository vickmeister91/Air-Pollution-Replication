The Madras High Court recently considered the issue of whether a writ petition can be filed against a co-operative society under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1983. The court referred to a previous decision that no writ can be filed against a co-operative society, but noted that it depends on whether the society is an instrumentality of the state or a private body. The court considered the tests laid down by the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Technology and concluded that it is not a rigid set of principles and depends on the cumulative facts of each case. The court ultimately held that a writ petition can be filed against a co-operative society if it is found to be an instrumentality of the state.

The court order discusses the criteria for determining whether a co-operative society is considered a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. The court applies the tests laid down in Ajay Hasia's case and Pradeep Kumar Biswas's case to determine whether a co-operative society registered under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act can be considered an agency or instrumentality of the State. The court finds that the society does not satisfy the criteria for being considered a State, as it does not have financial, functional, or administrative control by the government, nor does it perform functions of public importance closely related to governmental functions. The court also distinguishes this case from the U.P. State Co-operative Land Development Bank Limited case, where the State's participation and control in the bank's activities were all pervasive.

The court order states that the Co-operative Land Development Bank Limited is not applicable to the case at hand. The U.P. Land Development Bank Limited is controlled by the state and its officers head the institution. The bank is the only state-level bank in the state, and the government guarantees repayment in case of losses. The service conditions of the employees are governed by statutory rules. The court refers to various cases to explain when a writ petition can be maintained against private bodies or persons performing public duty. The court also notes that a writ may issue to private bodies or persons if there are statutory provisions that need to be complied with. The court distinguishes between private bodies that perform public duty and those that do not. The court also notes that the nature of the duty imposed on the body is relevant.

The court order discusses the circumstances under which a writ petition can be maintained. It states that before a party can complain of an infringement of their fundamental right to hold property, they must establish that they have title to that property. If their title is in dispute and is the subject of adjudication in legally constituted proceedings, they cannot put forward any claim based on the title until they establish their title. The order also discusses the nature of the statutory duty placed on co-operative societies and when a writ petition would lie against them. It concludes that a writ may issue to private bodies or persons if there are statutory provisions that need to be complied with, and if they violate such provisions, a writ would be issued for compliance. The order also notes that the bye-laws made by a co-operative society do not have the force of law, and the service conditions of its employees governed by its bye-laws cannot be enforced through a writ petition.

In summary, the Madras High Court has held that a writ petition can be filed against a co-operative society if it is found to be an instrumentality of the state. The court has also discussed the criteria for determining whether a co-operative society is considered a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. The court has distinguished between private bodies that perform public duty and those that do not, and has noted that the nature of the duty imposed on the body is relevant. The court has also discussed the circumstances under which a writ petition can be maintained, including the issue of title to property and the nature of the statutory duty placed on co-operative societies. Overall, the court's order provides important guidance on the circumstances under which a writ petition can be filed against a co-operative society under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1983.
