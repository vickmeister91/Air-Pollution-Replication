The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the possession of animal skins without proper legal documentation or authority. In the first case, three individuals were apprehended with a baby leopard skin and charged under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The court order includes details of the complaint, the accused, the witnesses, and the final order, which found the accused guilty. The judgment was delivered on April 11, 2018.

The second court order describes the testimony of several witnesses in a similar case involving three individuals found in possession of a baby leopard skin without a valid license or document. The witnesses include police officers who conducted the raid and seized the skin, as well as a wildlife inspector who identified the skin as belonging to a baby leopard. The accused individuals denied the allegations and claimed they were falsely implicated, but failed to provide evidence to support their defense. One of the accused individuals led defense evidence by calling two experts from the Wildlife Institute to testify about methods for identifying wildlife skins.

The third court order discusses the testimony of two witnesses in a case involving the possession of animal skins. The first witness, a forensic expert, explains the methods used to identify animal skins and confirms that it is not possible to create fake skins with the same characteristics as natural ones. The second witness, a senior technical officer, also describes the techniques used to identify animal skins and confirms that he can identify them through visual examination alone. The court considers the relevant provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and hears arguments from both the prosecution and defense before making a decision.

In the fourth court order, the defense argues that there is no evidence linking the accused to the recovered leopard skin and that the identification of the skin by a wildlife inspector is not sufficient. However, the court finds the testimony of the prosecution witnesses to be credible and consistent, and notes that the law does not require the presence of independent witnesses. The court also cites a legal presumption that possession of animal parts is unlawful unless proven otherwise, and finds that the accused have not provided evidence to rebut this presumption. Minor discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses are deemed insignificant. Ultimately, the court finds the accused guilty of the offense.

The fifth court order states that witnesses often exaggerate their testimony, but minor contradictions or embellishments should not be used to reject the prosecution's evidence. The court also notes that defects in the investigation do not necessarily lead to acquittal, and the evidence should be examined carefully to determine its reliability. In this specific case, the accused were found guilty of possessing and dealing with a baby leopard skin, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. They were convicted and their case property was confiscated.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of proper legal documentation and authority when it comes to the possession of animal skins. The Wildlife Protection Act is in place to protect endangered species and their habitats, and it is crucial that individuals abide by its regulations. The court orders also emphasize the need for reliable evidence and careful examination of testimony in order to make fair and just decisions.
