The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Bhupinder Singh against the State of Haryana and others regarding the issuance of an advertisement inviting tenders for displaying advertisement boards on busy roads. The petitioner argued that this was contrary to the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in previous cases.

The court opined that if directions had already been issued by the Supreme Court and this court, the writ petition was not a proper remedy. The court noted that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the advertisement or the tender process itself, but rather the fact that the advertisement had been issued at all. The court held that this was not a valid ground for a writ petition, as the petitioner had not shown that any legal right of his had been violated.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not shown that he had suffered any personal injury or loss as a result of the advertisement. The court held that a writ petition was not the appropriate remedy for a mere grievance or complaint, and that the petitioner should have sought other remedies if he wished to challenge the advertisement.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not shown that the advertisement was in violation of any specific law or regulation. The court held that the mere fact that the advertisement had been issued did not necessarily mean that it was illegal or improper.

In light of these considerations, the court disposed of the writ petition, giving the petitioner liberty to avail any other remedy as per law if he so desires. The court emphasized that this was not a decision on the merits of the petitioner's case, but rather a determination that a writ petition was not the appropriate remedy in this instance.

Overall, the court's order reflects a careful consideration of the petitioner's arguments and a clear explanation of the reasons for its decision. While the petitioner may be disappointed with the outcome, the court's reasoning suggests that it was a well-reasoned and legally sound decision.
