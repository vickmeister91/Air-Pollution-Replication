The court recently issued an order in a public interest litigation that challenged the grant of permission for open cast manual mining of Laterite in a part of land that was originally part of a reserve forest in Warangal District. The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed reports from various authorities before issuing its decision.

The court found that the environmental clearance had been granted taking into consideration relevant aspects in terms of ecology, environment, forests, wildlife, mining, and the need to utilize the available laterite through the process of sustainable development in the best interest of the community at large and intergenerational rights. The court recognized the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection and preservation.

The court directed the competent authority under the command of the District Collector of Jayashankar Bhupalpally District to ensure that there is complete compliance of the conditions imposed by the DEIAA. This is an important step in ensuring that the mining activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner, with due consideration given to the impact on the environment and the local community.

The court also vacated all interlocutory orders and closed all pending miscellaneous petitions. This means that the case has been resolved and there are no further legal challenges to the mining activities in question.

Overall, the court's decision reflects a careful consideration of the various factors at play in this case, including the need for economic development and the importance of environmental protection. By directing the competent authority to ensure compliance with the conditions imposed by the DEIAA, the court has taken an important step in ensuring that the mining activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.
