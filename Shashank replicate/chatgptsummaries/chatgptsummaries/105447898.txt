The court heard several petitions challenging orders passed by authorities in respect of different parcels of land. The petitioners challenged the orders on the grounds that the action against the sale transactions could not have been initiated after an unreasonable delay and that Section 73(A) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code could not have been invoked and applied against the transactions executed by the petitioners. However, the court rejected the petitions and upheld the orders passed by the authorities.

The court order states that since the transactions were executed before April 4, 1961, there was no obligation for the parties to seek permission from the authority, and therefore, it cannot be said that the transactions were entered into in breach of Section 73A of the Code. The court also considers the applicability of Section 73A of the Code and the contention that the proceedings were instituted after unreasonable delay. The court finds that the authorities have recorded concurrent findings of facts and that the petitioners failed to place any material on record which could establish that the transactions were executed before April 4, 1961. The court also considers a previous decision in a similar case and concludes that the notification issued under Section 73A of the BLR Code will apply to the disputed land.

In another case, the court order discusses the applicability of a notification under the Bombay Land Revenue Code to a disputed land. The court examines whether a survey settlement carried out by the authority before the introduction of the Bombay Land Revenue Code could be considered a survey settlement under the code or if a fresh survey is required. The court concludes that the survey settlement carried out by the Erstwhile State of Idar and accepted by the State of Gujarat would become the survey settlement under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, and therefore, the notification in question would not apply to the disputed land. The court also discusses the purpose of Section 73A, which aims to protect members of scheduled tribes against exploitation.

In yet another case, the court order discusses a notification issued under Section 73A that prohibits the transfer of land in certain tracts and villages to protect scheduled tribes. However, the notification in question was applied to all villages in scheduled areas in the State of Gujarat, including those where survey settlement had already been introduced, making the order illegal. The court also cites previous cases to support its interpretation of the notification and the provisions of Section 73A.

The court order also discusses the applicability of Section 73-A of the Bombay Land Revenue Code in the transfer of occupancy of tribal land. The Chief Secretary (Appeals) had previously held that the original survey settlement in Rajpipla had already been introduced, and therefore, Section 73-A did not apply to the transfer in question. The court found that the transfer was legal and valid, and the orders of the authorities below holding that the transfer stood regularized under Section 73-AA of the Code were set aside. The court also notes that it is important to establish whether a survey settlement was carried out before 4.4.1961 and accepted by the government to determine the applicability of Section 73-A.

However, the court order states that there is no available material to determine whether a survey was carried out before 4.4.1961 and whether it was accepted by the state government. The issues at hand are whether a survey settlement was carried out before 4.4.1961, whether it can be considered a survey settlement under Section 73A of the Code, and whether it has been accepted by the state government. The court emphasizes the need to verify factual aspects and ascertain that all pre-conditions are fulfilled before determining the said contentions. The court also takes into account a notification and resolution dated 4.4.1961 regarding the application of Section 73A of the Bombay Land Revenue Code to all villages in the Scheduled areas of the State.

The court order sets aside previous orders and remands the case to the first adjudicating authority to determine relevant factual aspects connected with the issue of survey settlement. The court emphasizes the need for relevant evidence to be examined and for the authority to decide the issues in a specified time limit. The order applies to several cases related to land revenue settlement in Gujarat.

In one specific case, SRD/LND/B/110/80, the court order states that it should be remanded to the first adjudicating authority, the Prant Officer and Deputy Collector in Rajpipla, to decide the case on its own merits and evidence without being influenced by previous orders. Both parties should be given an opportunity to present their evidence, and the authority should try to decide the case within four months. The status quo will continue until the final order is passed. 

In conclusion, the court order dealt with several cases related to land revenue settlement in Gujarat. The court upheld some orders passed by the authorities while setting aside others. The court emphasized the need to verify factual aspects and ascertain that all pre-conditions are fulfilled before determining the applicability of Section 73A of the Bombay Land Revenue Code. The court also remanded some cases to the first adjudicating authority to determine relevant factual aspects connected with the issue of survey settlement.
