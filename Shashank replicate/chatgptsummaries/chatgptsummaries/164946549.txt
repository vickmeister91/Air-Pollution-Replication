The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jaisukh @ Jaso Vallabhbhai Vaghela in connection with an FIR registered against him under various sections of the Prohibition Act. The court considered various aspects, including the fact that the applicant has been in jail since July 23, 2019, and that the investigation is almost concluded. The court also noted that no antecedent is reported against the applicant and that a co-accused has already been granted bail. Based on these factors, the court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail subject to certain conditions. The court also directed that the trial court shall not be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the court in the present order.

The court's decision to grant bail to Jaisukh @ Jaso Vallabhbhai Vaghela was based on several factors. Firstly, the court took into account the fact that the applicant had been in jail for a considerable period of time, since July 23, 2019. This suggests that the court was mindful of the principle of innocent until proven guilty, and did not want to keep the applicant in jail for an extended period of time without a trial.

Secondly, the court noted that the investigation in the case was almost concluded. This suggests that the court was of the view that the applicant was not likely to interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence, as the investigation was already at an advanced stage.

Thirdly, the court observed that no antecedent was reported against the applicant. This suggests that the court was of the view that the applicant did not have a history of criminal activity, and was therefore less likely to commit a crime in the future.

Finally, the court noted that a co-accused had already been granted bail. This suggests that the court was of the view that the applicant should not be treated differently from the co-accused, and that there was no reason to deny bail to the applicant if bail had already been granted to the co-accused.

Based on these factors, the court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail subject to certain conditions. The court also directed that the trial court shall not be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the court in the present order. This suggests that the court was mindful of the fact that the present order was only a bail order, and that the trial court would have to make its own independent assessment of the evidence in the case.
