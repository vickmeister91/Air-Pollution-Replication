The State of Kerala recently appealed a decision made by the Kerala High Court that directed the state government to seek approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for lease of 146.42 acres of land. The State argued that there is a statutory restriction on deforestation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest use in terms of Section 2 of the Act, and that the State Government does not want to lease any part of the forest land. The Supreme Court agreed with the State and set aside the High Court's decision, dismissing the writ petitions.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes and to ensure that such diversion is made only in the larger public interest. Section 2 of the Act provides that no state government or other authority shall make any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof be cleared for any non-forest purpose unless the Central Government is satisfied that such clearance is necessary for the purpose of public interest.

In the present case, the Kerala High Court had directed the state government to seek approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Act for lease of 146.42 acres of land. The High Court had observed that the state government had not obtained the necessary clearance from the Central Government before leasing the forest land to a private party for the construction of a resort. The High Court had also noted that the state government had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act for diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes.

The State of Kerala had challenged the High Court's decision before the Supreme Court. The State had argued that there is a statutory restriction on deforestation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest use in terms of Section 2 of the Act, and that the State Government does not want to lease any part of the forest land. The State had also contended that the High Court had erred in directing the state government to seek approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Act.

The Supreme Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, agreed with the State of Kerala and set aside the High Court's decision. The Court observed that the High Court had erred in directing the state government to seek approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Act. The Court noted that Section 2 of the Act applies only to cases where forest land is sought to be cleared for non-forest purposes, and that the State of Kerala had not sought to clear any forest land for non-forest purposes. The Court also observed that the state government had not leased any forest land to a private party for the construction of a resort, as alleged by the petitioners.

The Supreme Court further observed that the state government had not violated any provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 or any other law. The Court noted that the state government had followed the procedure prescribed under the Kerala Forest (Vesting and Management of Ecologically Fragile Lands) Act, 2003 for leasing the land in question. The Court also observed that the state government had obtained the necessary clearances from the Forest Department and the Revenue Department before leasing the land.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court has set aside the decision of the Kerala High Court that directed the state government to seek approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for lease of 146.42 acres of land. The Court has dismissed the writ petitions filed by the petitioners. The Court has observed that the state government had not violated any provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 or any other law, and that the state government had followed the procedure prescribed under the Kerala Forest (Vesting and Management of Ecologically Fragile Lands) Act, 2003 for leasing the land in question. The Court has also noted that the state government had obtained the necessary clearances from the Forest Department and the Revenue Department before leasing the land.
