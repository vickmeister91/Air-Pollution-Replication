The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bachchu under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Bachchu had been arrested by the Police Station Van Vibhag, Devri, District Morena, in connection with P.O.R. No.9873/2019 registered in relation to the offences punishable under Sections 27, 29, 50, 51 and 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41 and 52 of Indian Forest Act, 1927. The allegations against Bachchu were that he was involved in the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand by a truck which belongs to him. 

Bachchu had filed the bail application on the grounds that he was innocent and that he had been falsely implicated in the case. He had also argued that he was a law-abiding citizen and that he had no criminal antecedents. However, the court rejected his bail application, stating that it was not a fit case in which bail may be granted to the present applicant.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the allegations against Bachchu were serious in nature and that they involved offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act. These were laws that were designed to protect the environment and wildlife, and any violation of these laws was considered to be a serious offence.

Secondly, the court noted that the evidence against Bachchu was strong. The prosecution had presented several witnesses who had testified to seeing Bachchu's truck transporting Chambal Sand illegally. The court also noted that the police had recovered several incriminating documents from Bachchu's possession, which suggested that he was involved in the illegal transportation of sand.

Thirdly, the court noted that Bachchu was a repeat offender. He had been previously arrested and convicted for similar offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act. This suggested that Bachchu had a propensity to commit such offences and that he was likely to continue to do so if released on bail.

Based on these factors, the court concluded that Bachchu was not entitled to bail. The court noted that the allegations against him were serious, the evidence against him was strong, and that he was a repeat offender. The court also noted that if Bachchu was released on bail, he was likely to abscond and evade trial. Therefore, the court rejected his bail application.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bachchu under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Bachchu had been arrested in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand by a truck which belongs to him. The court rejected his bail application, stating that it was not a fit case in which bail may be granted to the present applicant. The court's decision was based on several factors, including the serious nature of the allegations against Bachchu, the strong evidence against him, and his previous criminal record.
