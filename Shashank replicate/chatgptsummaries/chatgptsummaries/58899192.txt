The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard three separate appeals related to illegal mining activities in the state. The first appeal involved a petition filed by members of Scheduled Tribe categories, who claimed that a private respondent had illegally obtained permission for mining work on forest and revenue land. The petitioners argued that the mining activities were in violation of environmental clearance and pollution laws. The court was informed that the mining operation had been suspended, but it continued illegally. The petitioners requested the court to take suitable action against the erring private respondents.

During the hearing, the court noted that the mining activities were indeed in violation of environmental clearance and pollution laws. The court also observed that the private respondent had obtained permission for mining work on land belonging to Scheduled Tribe categories, which was illegal. The court directed the state government to take appropriate action against the erring private respondents and ensure that the mining activities were stopped immediately.

The second appeal involved a case where Respondent No.10 was charged with offenses under pollution laws for carrying out illegal mining activities. The respondent claimed to have obtained due approval and permission from state authorities. However, various government agencies had taken action against the respondent for alleged illegal mining activities. The court found no error in the impugned order and concluded that no specific directions need to be issued as appropriate action had already been taken.

The third appeal was dismissed by the court, which upheld the decision of the learned single judge. The appeal was related to mining activities carried out by concerned authorities. The court found that the learned single judge had considered all facts and laws presented and made no errors in the impugned order. The appeal was deemed to be devoid of merit and substance.

In all three appeals, the court emphasized the importance of following environmental clearance and pollution laws while carrying out mining activities. The court also stressed the need to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribe categories and ensure that their land was not illegally obtained for mining purposes. The court directed the state government to take appropriate action against those found guilty of violating these laws and regulations.

Overall, the court's decisions in these appeals reflect its commitment to upholding environmental laws and protecting the rights of marginalized communities. The court's emphasis on the need to follow due process and obtain necessary approvals before carrying out mining activities is a positive step towards sustainable development in the state.
