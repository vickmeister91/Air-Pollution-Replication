The court order in question relates to a case between Anil Bathvi and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The petitioner's counsel had submitted an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) after cross-examination, and the order passed on that application is now being challenged in another case that is pending before the court.

In this particular case, the petitioner has expressed that they do not wish to press the present petition any further. As a result, the court has dismissed the petition as not pressed. However, the question of law that was raised in the petition has been left open for further consideration.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows for the production of documents or other material objects that are necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers a court to issue a summons or order to any person who is in possession of such documents or objects, requiring them to produce them before the court.

It is not clear from the available information what specific documents or objects were being sought by the petitioner's counsel in this case. However, it is clear that the order passed on the application made under Section 91 is now being challenged in another case.

The fact that the petitioner has chosen not to press the present petition suggests that they may have achieved their desired outcome through the other case that is pending before the court. Alternatively, they may have decided that pursuing the present petition is no longer in their best interests for other reasons.

The decision to dismiss the petition as not pressed means that the case will not proceed any further. However, the question of law that was raised in the petition has been left open for further consideration. This means that the court may still need to address the legal issue at a later date, either in this case or in another case that raises similar issues.

Overall, the court order in question is relatively straightforward. It pertains to a case between Anil Bathvi and the CBI, and relates to an application made under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner has chosen not to press the present petition, but the question of law that was raised in the petition has been left open for further consideration. It remains to be seen whether this issue will be addressed in this case or in another case that raises similar issues.
