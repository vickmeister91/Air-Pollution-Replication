In a recent case, the State filed a criminal revision petition against the trial court's order dismissing their application under Section 91 of the Cr.PC for placing material documents on record. The State argued that the documents were essential for a just decision of the case, while the accused's counsel argued that the trial court's order was fair and reasonable. 

The court found that the application was filed nearly four years after the submission of written arguments and that allowing such applications after such long delays would prolong criminal litigations. Therefore, the court dismissed the State's criminal revision petition. 

The case highlights the importance of timely filing of applications in criminal proceedings. The court's decision emphasizes that allowing applications to be filed after long delays would only serve to prolong the litigation process, which is not in the interest of justice. 

It is important for parties to be diligent in their approach to criminal proceedings and to ensure that all necessary documents and evidence are submitted in a timely manner. This will not only help to expedite the proceedings but also ensure that justice is served in a timely manner. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in criminal proceedings to be diligent in their approach and to ensure that all necessary documents and evidence are submitted in a timely manner. This will help to expedite the proceedings and ensure that justice is served in a timely manner.
