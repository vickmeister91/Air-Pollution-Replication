The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court order provides a detailed background of the case, including the facts and legal provisions involved.

One of the writ petitions involves a controversy over the demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, for the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The petitioners seek various reliefs, including the quashing of the demand notice and the refund of the amount deposited as NPV. The court heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.

The court order states that in 2001, 63 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, deposited compensation for the diversion of forest land. However, out of a total of 136 lease holders, the rest either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled, leaving the land unutilized. The Forest Department is now asking the petitioners to deposit the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for all 136 mining leases, which the petitioners argue is contrary to the law. The court also notes that a letter from the Government of India exempts forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected from the provisions of NPV. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster.

Another writ petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire 281 hectares.

The court order also pertains to a cluster area of 281 hectares in Udaipur, where 136 mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal to divert forest land for mining purposes. The court finds that the mining lease holders are not entitled to relief as they refused to segregate cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court partially allows the writ petitions and directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excludes the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directs the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases.

In summary, the court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court provides a detailed background of the case and considers the facts and legal provisions involved. The court partially allows the writ petitions and directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excludes the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases from the total area while computing the NPV and directs the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
