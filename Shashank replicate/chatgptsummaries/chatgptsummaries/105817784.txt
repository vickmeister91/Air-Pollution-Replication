The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between the Municipal Corp. of Greater Mumbai and Hiraman Sitaram Deorukhar regarding a disputed property that was reserved for a garden in the development plan. The reservation had lapsed due to the failure of state authorities to act timely and issue a declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. However, the court emphasized the importance of preserving open spaces for public parks and the duty of state authorities to do so.

The court order emphasizes the importance of preserving open spaces for parks and playgrounds in development schemes, as they promote public health and well-being. Any action that goes against this legislative intent is invalid and inconsistent with statutory requirements. The court cites various cases and legal principles to support the duty of government authorities to protect natural resources and the environment for the enjoyment of the general public. The court also notes that inaction by authorities can be considered a wrongful deprivation of public spaces and a breach of public trust. The order highlights the need for affirmative action to make remedies effective and ensure that statutory duties are fulfilled.

The court order states that financial or other disabilities cannot excuse authorities from their statutory liability. In this case, the authorities failed to issue a declaration under the MRTP Act, which made the provisions for open spaces a mockery. The court directs that the land be preserved for a public garden, and compensation be determined and paid in accordance with the 2013 Act. The court also criticizes the authorities for their inaction and breach of fundamental duty to protect the natural environment. The appeals are allowed, and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. No order as to costs.

The court granted leave and disposed of the appeals in accordance with the signed order. Any pending applications were also disposed of.
