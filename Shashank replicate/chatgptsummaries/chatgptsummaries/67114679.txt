The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between the State of Orissa and the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding an inter-state river water dispute. The court framed several issues to be addressed, including the effect of a previous water dispute tribunal award, the design of the Polavaram project, and the potential adverse effects on tribal areas and populations. The plaintiff and defendants were given time to file their documents, and the matter was scheduled to be heard again in September 2018.

The dispute between the two states revolves around the sharing of water from the Godavari River, which flows through both states. The Polavaram project, which is being constructed by the Andhra Pradesh government, aims to divert water from the Godavari River to the Krishna River, which flows through the state of Andhra Pradesh. The project has been a source of contention between the two states, with Orissa claiming that it will adversely affect the flow of water to its own state.

The court has framed several issues to be addressed in the case, including the effect of a previous water dispute tribunal award. The tribunal had awarded a certain amount of water to Orissa, and the state is now claiming that the Polavaram project will reduce the amount of water it receives. The court will also examine the design of the Polavaram project and its potential adverse effects on tribal areas and populations.

The court has given both the plaintiff and defendants time to file their documents, and the matter is scheduled to be heard again in September 2018. The court has also issued notice to the states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and the Union of India, and their representatives have accepted the notice. The states have three weeks to file a reply, and the application will be listed on September 6th, 2018.

The case is significant as it highlights the ongoing disputes between states over the sharing of water resources. India has a federal system of government, and water is a state subject. This has led to several inter-state disputes over the years, with states often accusing each other of not sharing water fairly. The Supreme Court has been called upon to resolve many of these disputes, and its decisions have often been controversial.

In this case, the court will have to balance the interests of both states and ensure that the sharing of water is done in a fair and equitable manner. The court will also have to take into account the potential adverse effects of the Polavaram project on tribal areas and populations. The project has been criticized by several environmental groups, who claim that it will lead to the displacement of thousands of people and the destruction of forests and wildlife habitats.

The court's decision in this case will have far-reaching implications for the sharing of water resources between states in India. It will also set a precedent for future disputes over water resources, and could potentially lead to the development of a more comprehensive framework for the sharing of water between states.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India's recent hearing of the inter-state river water dispute between the State of Orissa and the State of Andhra Pradesh highlights the ongoing disputes between states over the sharing of water resources. The court has framed several issues to be addressed, including the effect of a previous water dispute tribunal award, the design of the Polavaram project, and the potential adverse effects on tribal areas and populations. The court has given both the plaintiff and defendants time to file their documents, and the matter is scheduled to be heard again in September 2018. The court's decision in this case will have far-reaching implications for the sharing of water resources between states in India and could potentially lead to the development of a more comprehensive framework for the sharing of water between states.
