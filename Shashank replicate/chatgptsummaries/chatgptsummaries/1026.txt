The Madurai District Collector was recently the subject of a writ petition filed by E.S. Raja Gopal. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the District Collector in his Proceedings Na.Ka.No.241/2010 Mines dated 02.09.2010, which was published in Madurai Gazette dated 03.09.2010 (issue No.34). The petitioner claimed that S.F.No.1/1 is a forest land and continuation of Sirumalai hills and the hill is situated amidst the forest, natural herbals, plants, and trees. The District Forest Officer had requested the District Collector to declare S.F.No.1/1 of Ramagoundanpatti village under the category of "Reserve Forest." However, certain persons were trying to get a quarry license to quarry stones in Paliyan Karadu.

The court ultimately quashed the impugned notification No.34 dated 03.09.2010 insofar as S.F.No.1/1 (Part) to an extent of 2.00.0 Hectares of Paliyan karadu, Ramagoundanpatti village, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District. The respondent was directed to forward the recommendation of the District Forest Officer, Madurai Forest Division, to the District Revenue Officer within two weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of the order.
