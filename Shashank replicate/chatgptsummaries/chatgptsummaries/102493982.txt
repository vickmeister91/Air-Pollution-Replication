Dr. KR Davies, a petitioner, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a direction to dispose of his representation and to give police protection. The representation was against the Federal Bank, Vatanapally Branch. The petitioner had made a complaint against the bank, which is a private bank, and sought relief from the court. However, the court found that the complaint made by the petitioner against the bank was not clearly maintainable.

The court cited previous Supreme Court cases that private companies carrying on banking business cannot be termed as institutions or companies carrying on any statutory or public duty. The court observed that the bank was a private entity and was not performing any public duty. Therefore, the court held that the writ petition filed by the petitioner was not maintainable.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out any case for police protection. The court held that the petitioner had not shown any threat to his life or property. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner.

The court did not pass any order as to costs. The court held that since the petitioner had not made out any case, there was no need to award costs to either party.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the entity against which a complaint is made. Private companies carrying on banking business cannot be termed as institutions or companies carrying on any statutory or public duty. Therefore, complaints against such entities may not be maintainable in court.

The case also highlights the importance of making out a case for relief. The petitioner had not made out any case for police protection. The court held that the petitioner had not shown any threat to his life or property. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner.
