The Indian judiciary is responsible for resolving disputes and ensuring justice is served. In two separate court orders, the courts have ruled on disputes over land ownership in Jammu and Kashmir. The first case involved a dispute between Budhi Singh and the successors-in-interest of another co-owner over a portion of land. The second case involved a claim by an appellant to be a tenant of a co-owner's land and the rectification of khasra entry.

In the first case, Budhi Singh claimed ownership of a portion of land that was disputed by the successors-in-interest of another co-owner. The case involved several orders and appeals, including a visit to the site by the Commissioner. The appellant argued that the Commissioner's order was passed ex-parte and without hearing him, but the court found no sufficient ground for disagreeing with the view taken by the learned Writ Court. Ultimately, the court upheld the previous decisions and dismissed the appeal.

The dispute over land ownership in Jammu and Kashmir was a complex case that involved multiple orders and appeals. The appellant, Budhi Singh, claimed ownership of a portion of land that was disputed by the successors-in-interest of another co-owner. The case involved a visit to the site by the Commissioner, and the appellant argued that the Commissioner's order was passed ex-parte and without hearing him. However, the court found no sufficient ground for disagreeing with the view taken by the learned Writ Court. Ultimately, the court upheld the previous decisions and dismissed the appeal.

In the second case, the appellant claimed to be a tenant of a co-owner's land and sought rectification of khasra entry. The court rejected the appellant's claim and stated that the situation would not have changed even if the appellant had taken part in the proceedings. The court also discussed the principle of audi alteram partem, which means that no one should be condemned unheard, and the useless formality theory, which suggests that a hearing is a mere formality and does not affect the outcome of the case. Ultimately, the court dismissed the appeal as having no merit.
