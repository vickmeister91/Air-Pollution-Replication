The court order in question pertains to two appeals that arose from an application under Section 12 of the Encumbered Estates Act. The case involves four mortgages made by the applicants in favour of certain creditors, which were alleged to be invalid. The Special Judge had given a judgment under Section 14 of the Act, holding that all four mortgages were not made in good faith and were void. The appeals were filed against this order, and the court found that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the transfers were not made in good faith.

The Encumbered Estates Act was enacted in 1848 in British India to provide relief to landowners who were unable to pay their debts. The Act allowed landowners to apply to the court to have their estates sold and the proceeds used to pay off their debts. The Act also provided for the appointment of a Special Judge to oversee the sale of the estate and the distribution of the proceeds.

In the case at hand, the applicants had made four mortgages in favour of certain creditors. The Special Judge had held that all four mortgages were not made in good faith and were void. The applicants had filed two appeals against this order.

The court found that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the transfers were not made in good faith. The court noted that the Special Judge had not given any reasons for his conclusion that the transfers were not made in good faith. The court also noted that the Special Judge had not considered the evidence that was presented by the applicants to show that the transfers were made in good faith.

The court also dismissed one of the appeals as some of the creditors had not been properly served. The court found that the notice of the appeal had not been served on some of the creditors, and therefore, the appeal could not proceed.

The court allowed the other appeal and set aside the order of the Special Judge concerning the mortgages. The court held that the Special Judge had not given any reasons for his conclusion that the transfers were not made in good faith. The court also held that the Special Judge had not considered the evidence that was presented by the applicants to show that the transfers were made in good faith.
