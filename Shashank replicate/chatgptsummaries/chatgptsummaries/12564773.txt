The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The specific details of each petition are not provided in the summary. However, the court lists the names of the petitions and the corresponding petitioners and respondents. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industry. The legal representation for both the petitioners and respondents is also mentioned.

One of the petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India claims relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity, and the petitioners seek the quashing of the demand notice, a refund of the NPV deposited, and other appropriate orders. The court heard the petitions together and decided them by a common judgment. The court reviewed the facts of the case, including the policy and circulars governing the deposit of NPV, and ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners, quashing the demand notice and ordering the refund of the NPV deposited.

Another petition pertains to a dispute between mining lease holders and the Forest Department regarding the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land. The petitioners argue that they are being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and the common area, which is being utilized by the cluster members. They also argue that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster show that only 63 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, deposited the NPV amount, and the rest either surrendered their leases or had their leases cancelled. The court has yet to make a ruling on the matter.

Another petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The last petition pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and only the extension proposal for the rest of the mining leases was submitted. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard the petitions together and decided them by a common judgment. One of the petitions claimed relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The court ruled in favor of the petitioners, quashing the demand notice and ordering the refund of the NPV deposited. The other petitions pertain to disputes between mining lease holders and the Forest Department regarding the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land. The court has yet to make a ruling on some of these petitions, while in others, the court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.
