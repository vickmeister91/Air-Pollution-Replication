The court order pertains to a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, where two individuals are accused of illegally capturing, killing, and consuming a wild animal during a party organized in an agricultural field in Amravati. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision on the bail application. The defense argues that there is no evidence against the accused except for the statement of a co-accused, which was not taken in their presence. The prosecution argues that the custody of the accused is necessary for a deeper investigation.

The court order describes the case where two individuals are accused of illegally capturing and cooking a Monitor Lizard, a wild animal. The court has ordered their custodial interrogation as it is suspected that they may have been involved in a larger network of poaching and selling wild animals. The co-accused's statements show that the applicants participated in acquiring illegal possession of a scheduled wild animal, the Monitor Lizard, and consuming its cooked meat as food. The statements also reveal that the applicants allowed entry to the co-accused into the field and partook in the consumption of the meat. The DNA report confirms that the animal was an endangered species. The bar under Section 50(9) of the Act of 1972, which prohibits the admissibility of evidence recorded in the absence of the accused, does not apply at this stage of investigation. The term "evidence" in this context refers to oral evidence, and the recorded statements of the co-accused are admissible at this stage.

The court order discusses the admissibility of recorded statements under Section 50(9) of the Act of 1972. It explains that statements made in the presence of the accused person by someone other than the accused can be admitted as evidence in a subsequent trial before a magistrate, but statements made by the accused themselves are excluded. However, the statements of co-accused can be considered as confessions if they reveal relevant facts. The order also discusses the prohibited acts under Sections 39(3)(a)(b)(c) and 49 of the Act of 1972, which the accused are alleged to have committed.

The court order states that the applicants were involved in acquiring and keeping a wild animal, the Large Bengal Monitor Lizard, and cooking and consuming it illegally. The seriousness of the crime is highlighted as it can disturb or destroy the forest ecosystem, which is important for the survival of mankind. The punishment for such acts is imprisonment for a term of not less than three years and may extend to seven years. The court also mentions the network of persons involved in poaching, selling, and buying such animals for profit or fun.

The court order denies anticipatory bail to the applicants who are suspected of poaching and selling a Monitor Lizard for profit. The investigating officer has not been able to determine the source and manner of procurement, and custodial interrogation is deemed necessary. The applicants' argument of belonging to a respected class in society goes against them, as they have not shown responsibility towards society. The possibility of misusing liberty if released on bail is also a concern. The application for anticipatory bail is rejected.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, where two individuals are accused of illegally capturing, killing, and consuming a wild animal during a party organized in an agricultural field in Amravati.
