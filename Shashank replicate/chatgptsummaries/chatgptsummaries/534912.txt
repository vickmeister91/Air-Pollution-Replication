The court order in question pertains to a dispute over a mining lease for an area called 'Cheja Pather'. The petitioner, who holds the lease, argues that the lease was granted before the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came into force, and therefore, the Act does not apply. However, the court finds that the lease was granted after the Act came into force and without the prior approval of the Central Government, which is required for any non-forest purpose on protected forest land. Therefore, the petitioner cannot operate the mine, and the writ petition is dismissed.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes must be approved by the Central Government. The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Board for Wildlife to advise the Central Government on matters relating to the conservation of wildlife and forests.
