The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity heard a case involving M/S. JSW Energy Limited and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. and Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. The appellant had filed a petition claiming the cost of installation of Flue Gas De-sulphurisation (FGD) system to be included in the Project Cost as per Power Purchase Agreement dated 23.2.2008. However, the claim was rejected by the State Commission through the order dated 25.5.2011. The Appellant filed an appeal against this decision. The case involved the installation of FGD system and the interpretation of Clause 13 of the Power Purchase Agreement.

The dispute centered around the installation of FGD by the Appellant in accordance with the Power Purchase Agreement. The State Commission dismissed the Appellant's claim, stating that the installation of FGD was mandated in the initial Environmental clearance and should have been included in the total cost. The Appellant argued that the mandate was issued only on 16.4.2010 and therefore constitutes a "Change in Law" under the PPA. The court had to determine whether there was a change in law and whether the Appellant's non-disclosure of pending litigation related to the Environmental clearance affects their claim.

The court reviewed the relevant chronological events, including the issuance of environmental clearance and the bidding process. Ultimately, the court rejected the appellant's claim, stating that the initial environmental clearance mandated the installation of FGD and the cost should have been included in the project cost. The court found that the appellant did not comply with the conditions of the Environmental Clearance dated 17.5.2007, which mandated the installation of FGD and separate funds for it. The court found that there was no "Change in Law" as claimed by the appellant and dismissed the appeal as devoid of merits.

In another case, the court addressed a dispute between a generating company and a distribution licensee over financial benefits due to a change in law regarding the installation of a Flue Gas Desulphurisation System (FGD). The generating company claimed Rs.150 crore as an increase in project cost due to the imposition of additional conditions by the government. However, the court rejected the claim, stating that the conditions did not qualify as a change in law under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and that the generating company was responsible for obtaining all necessary consents. The court also noted that the generating company had disregarded the Ministry's directions regarding the FGD and had suppressed information about pending litigation in bid documents. The court did not address the issue of non-disclosure of pending litigation, leaving it to be decided in appropriate proceedings.

The court also clarified that there has been no change in law regarding the requirement for the installation of a Flue Gas De-Sulphurisation (FGD) system before commissioning a project and the allocation of separate funds for this purpose. The court found that the Environmental Clearance provided for the installation of FGD at a later stage and mandated that separate funds be allotted for the installation of the said FGD, which are to be included in the project cost. The court rejected the appellant's claim that FGD funds were not required to be included in the project cost and stated that the bidding process would be vitiated if the claim were accepted. The court also noted that the terms of the contract have to be read as a whole and cannot be read in isolation.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed disputes over the installation of Flue Gas De-sulphurisation (FGD) systems and the interpretation of Power Purchase Agreements. The court found that the initial environmental clearance mandated the installation of FGD and the cost should have been included in the project cost. The court also clarified that there has been no change in law regarding the requirement for the installation of FGD before commissioning a project and the allocation of separate funds for this purpose. The court rejected claims that additional conditions imposed by the government constituted a change in law and found that the generating company was responsible for obtaining all necessary consents. The court emphasized that the terms of the contract have to be read as a whole and cannot be read in isolation.
