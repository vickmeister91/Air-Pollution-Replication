In the first court order, the review petition was filed against a judgment in a writ petition. The writ petition was filed to quash an order passed by the Land Revenue Commissioner remitting a matter back to the District Collector for fresh disposal. The Division Bench of the court had come to the conclusion that the order was liable to be quashed and had issued appropriate directions. The review petitioners argued that relevant facts were not considered in the light of statutory provisions prevailing during the relevant time. However, the court rejected this argument and upheld its previous decision.

The second court order dealt with the resumption of land and stated that it cannot be made in an illegal manner. The order of resumption in this case was found to be bad in law. The court clarified that its judgment does not preclude the government from taking any other action in accordance with the law. The court also rejected the contention that the judgment was pronounced after the judge had vacated office due to transfer orders. The court stated that the scope of review is limited to discovery of new evidence, error apparent on the face of the record, or any other sufficient reason.

The third court order discussed the circumstances under which a review of a judgment can be requested. It stated that a review can be requested if there is a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason. However, the court clarified that a review is not maintainable for minor mistakes, or if the same relief sought at the time of arguing the main matter had been negatived. The court dismissed all review petitions in this case, but clarified that the judgment shall not preclude any statutory or other competent authority from taking necessary action in accordance with the law.

In summary, these court orders deal with various legal issues and provide guidance on the circumstances under which a review of a judgment can be requested. The court emphasizes that a review is not maintainable for minor mistakes and that the scope of review is limited to discovery of new evidence, error apparent on the face of the record, or any other sufficient reason. The court also clarifies that its judgment does not preclude any statutory or other competent authority from taking necessary action in accordance with the law. Overall, these court orders provide important insights into the legal system and the process of seeking a review of a judgment.
