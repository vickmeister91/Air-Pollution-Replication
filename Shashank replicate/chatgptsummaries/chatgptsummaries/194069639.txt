The court order pertains to a public interest petition filed by environmentalist lawyer M.C. Mehta seeking direction to the Haryana Pollution Control Board to control pollution caused by stone crushers, pulverisers, and mine operators in the Faridabad-Balabgarh area. The court is monitoring the petition and considering whether mining operations should be stopped within a five-kilometer radius of tourist resorts in Haryana to preserve the environment and control pollution.

The court has directed the mine lease holders to prepare an Environmental Management Plan and implement it following a time-bound action plan. The court has also sought an expert opinion from the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute on whether mining operations in the area should be stopped in the interest of environmental protection, pollution control, and tourism development. The NEERI has filed its inspection report, and the court is hearing the arguments of the mine operators.

The NEERI report shows that air pollution from mining activities is significant, and the court is considering whether mining operations should be stopped within a five-kilometer radius of tourist resorts. The court order discusses the impact of mining operations on the environment and recommends measures to control pollution and preserve the ecology. The report recommends detailed exploratory operations, scientific management of mining operations, and the preparation of mining plans. It also suggests the development of green belts around the tourist resorts and the implementation of dust suppression measures.

The court concludes that mining activities in the area should be stopped to preserve the environment and control pollution. The report recommends the development of 200-meter green belts at a 1 km radius around the boundaries of the two lakes. The court order states that mining activity must be stopped within a 2 km radius of the tourist resorts of Badkhal and Surajkund. The Forest Department of the State of Haryana is directed to develop green belts of 200 meters around the boundaries of the two lakes, and an additional 800 meters as a cushion to absorb air and noise pollution. No construction of any type is permitted within a 5 km radius of the lakes, and mining leases within the area from 2 km to 5 km radius shall not be renewed without obtaining prior "no objection" certificates from the Haryana Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board.

The court order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and controlling pollution caused by mining activities in the Faridabad-Balabgarh area. The court's decision to stop mining activities within a five-kilometer radius of tourist resorts is a crucial step towards preserving the ecology and promoting tourism development in the region. The court's direction to the mine lease holders to prepare an Environmental Management Plan and implement it following a time-bound action plan is a positive step towards ensuring that mining activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner.

The NEERI report's findings on the significant air pollution caused by mining activities in the area highlight the urgent need for measures to control pollution and preserve the environment. The court's recommendation to develop green belts around the tourist resorts and implement dust suppression measures is a positive step towards achieving this goal. The court's decision to stop mining activities within a two-kilometer radius of the tourist resorts of Badkhal and Surajkund and the Forest Department's direction to develop green belts of 200 meters around the boundaries of the two lakes and an additional 800 meters as a cushion to absorb air and noise pollution is a significant step towards preserving the ecology and promoting tourism development in the region.

The court's direction that no construction of any type is permitted within a five-kilometer radius of the lakes and mining leases within the area from 2 km to 5 km radius shall not be renewed without obtaining prior "no objection" certificates from the Haryana Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board is a crucial step towards ensuring that the environment is protected and pollution is controlled in the region.

In conclusion, the court order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and controlling pollution caused by mining activities in the Faridabad-Balabgarh area. The court's decision to stop mining activities within a five-kilometer radius of tourist resorts, the direction to the mine lease holders to prepare an Environmental Management Plan and implement it following a time-bound action plan, and the Forest Department's direction to develop green belts around the tourist resorts and an additional cushion to absorb air and noise pollution are positive steps towards achieving this goal. The court's direction that no construction of any type is permitted within a five-kilometer radius of the lakes and mining leases within the area from 2 km to 5 km radius shall not be renewed without obtaining prior "no objection" certificates from the Haryana Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board is a crucial step towards ensuring that the environment is protected and pollution is controlled in the region.
