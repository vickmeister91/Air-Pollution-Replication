The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order pertaining to six petitions filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The eviction petitions were filed by M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. under Section 14(1)(i) and Section 22 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, alleging that the premises in question were allotted to the respondent for residential purposes as a service tenant exclusively by virtue of their being in the service and employment of the said company.

The defense set up in all the petitions was that allotment was not due to the allottee being an employee of M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. The court allowed some eviction petitions and dismissed others. The court held that a tenant who accepts a person as his landlord is estopped from questioning the title of his landlord. The authentication by a notary public is a solemn act performed by the notary public whose duty is to ensure that the executant is the person before him and is identified to his satisfaction.

The court order is significant as it deals with the issue of eviction of service tenants. The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, provides for the regulation of rents and evictions and the prevention of unauthorized occupation of premises in Delhi. The Act applies to residential and non-residential premises, including shops, offices, and industrial premises. The Act also provides for the protection of tenants against eviction, except in certain cases specified in the Act.

The court order clarifies that a tenant who accepts a person as his landlord is estopped from questioning the title of his landlord. This means that if a tenant has accepted a person as his landlord, he cannot later claim that the person is not the rightful owner of the property. The court also held that the authentication by a notary public is a solemn act performed by the notary public whose duty is to ensure that the executant is the person before him and is identified to his satisfaction. This means that if a document is notarized, it is considered to be authentic and legally binding.

The court order also highlights the importance of the defense set up by the tenants in the eviction petitions. The tenants had claimed that the allotment was not due to their being employees of M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. The court allowed some eviction petitions and dismissed others based on the defense set up by the tenants. This shows that tenants have the right to defend themselves against eviction and that their defense can be a deciding factor in the outcome of the case.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the Delhi High Court is significant as it deals with the issue of eviction of service tenants. The court clarified that a tenant who accepts a person as his landlord is estopped from questioning the title of his landlord and that the authentication by a notary public is a solemn act performed by the notary public whose duty is to ensure that the executant is the person before him and is identified to his satisfaction. The court also highlighted the importance of the defense set up by the tenants in the eviction petitions. This court order provides clarity on the legal rights and obligations of service tenants and landlords and will have a significant impact on future cases related to eviction of service tenants.
