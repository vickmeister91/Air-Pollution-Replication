The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board has been embroiled in controversy for some time now, with allegations of corruption and mismanagement swirling around the organization. One of the key figures in this drama has been Tileshwar Sahu, who was removed from his position as Chairman of the Board in 2018. Sahu filed a writ petition challenging his removal, but the Jharkhand High Court has now upheld the decision to remove him from his post.

The court's decision was based on several factors. First, the court noted that there was no provision for a personal hearing in the process of removing Sahu from his position. However, the court also found that this did not invalidate the decision to remove him, as there was ample evidence to support the decision. Specifically, the court cited Sahu's involvement in criminal cases as a key factor in tarnishing the image of the Board.

The court's decision to uphold Sahu's removal was not unexpected, given the mounting evidence against him. However, the court's decision to stay subsequent notifications appointing a Chairman of the Board until the writ petition is finally heard and disposed of is significant. This means that the Board will be without a Chairman until the matter is resolved, which could take some time.

The court's decision also includes a directive that a competent person with a clean record and integrity be appointed as Chairman of the Board. This is an important step in restoring public trust in the organization, which has been badly damaged by the allegations of corruption and mismanagement. The court's decision sends a clear message that the Board must be run by individuals who are committed to transparency and accountability.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive development for the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. While the removal of Sahu was not unexpected, the court's decision to stay subsequent notifications and appoint a competent Chairman is a step in the right direction. It remains to be seen how long it will take for the writ petition to be finally heard and disposed of, but in the meantime, the Board must focus on restoring public trust and improving its operations.
