The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/s Saraswati Industries against the Secretary of Forest Environment and Ecology Department, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Managing Director of BESCOM, Deputy Commissioner of Bangalore Urban District, and Assistant Executive Engineer of BWSSB. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board directing the petitioner to close the industry and disconnect the power supply.

The petitioner, M/s Saraswati Industries, is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and processing of chemicals. The company had been operating from a location in Bangalore for several years. However, in 2018, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to the company directing it to close down its operations and disconnect the power supply. The notice was issued on the grounds that the company was operating without obtaining necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board.

The petitioner challenged the notice before the Karnataka High Court by way of a writ petition. The petitioner contended that the notice was arbitrary and illegal as the company had already applied for necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner also contended that the notice was issued without giving the company an opportunity to be heard.

The Karnataka High Court heard the arguments of both parties and examined the relevant provisions of law. The court observed that the Pollution Control Board had issued the notice after conducting an inspection of the petitioner's premises and finding that the company was operating without obtaining necessary consents. The court also noted that the petitioner had not obtained necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board despite being given several opportunities to do so.

The court further observed that the Pollution Control Board had the power to issue such notices under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the notice issued by the Pollution Control Board was not arbitrary or illegal and was issued in accordance with the provisions of law.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the Pollution Control Board before the appellate authority provided under the law. The court held that the petitioner could not bypass the appellate authority and directly approach the court.

However, the court also observed that the petitioner had expressed its willingness to shift its industry to a new location and had already obtained necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board for the same. The court held that the petitioner could be allowed to shift its industry to a new location after obtaining necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board.

In light of the above observations, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner challenging the notice issued by the Pollution Control Board. The court allowed the petitioner to shift its industry to a new location after obtaining necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's judgment in the writ petition filed by M/s Saraswati Industries highlights the importance of obtaining necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board before commencing any industrial activity. The judgment also emphasizes the need to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to shift its industry to a new location after obtaining necessary consents from the Pollution Control Board is a welcome move as it balances the interests of the industry and the environment.
