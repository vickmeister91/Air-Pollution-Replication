The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Baddu Sikarwar, who had been arrested for an offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Indian Forest Act. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 50,000/- each. This means that Sikarwar would have to pay a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- as a guarantee that he would comply with the conditions set by the court, and would also have to provide two people who would act as sureties, each of whom would have to pay Rs. 50,000/- if Sikarwar failed to comply with the conditions.

The court also set out a number of conditions that Sikarwar would have to comply with in order to remain out on bail. These included cooperating in the investigation/trial, not committing a similar offence, and not leaving India without permission. These conditions are designed to ensure that Sikarwar does not abscond or interfere with the investigation or trial in any way.

In addition to these conditions, the court also ordered that a copy of the order be sent for compliance and given to the Public Prosecutor. This means that the court wants to ensure that Sikarwar complies with the conditions set out in the order, and that the Public Prosecutor is aware of the conditions and can take action if Sikarwar fails to comply.

Overall, the court order in this case is fairly standard for a bail application. The court has set out a number of conditions that Sikarwar must comply with in order to remain out on bail, and has also required him to provide a personal bond and two sureties. The order also ensures that the Public Prosecutor is aware of the conditions and can take action if necessary.
