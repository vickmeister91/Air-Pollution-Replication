The court has granted bail to Shailesh Singh, who was arrested in connection with a wildlife crime case. Singh was accused of hunting a leopard, but his lawyer argued that he was falsely implicated. The court allowed the bail application and ordered Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his presence during trial and compliance with the conditions of Section 437 of the Cr.P.C.

The case against Singh was related to the hunting of a leopard, which is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that Singh was involved in the hunting of the leopard and had also sold its skin. The police had arrested Singh on the basis of a complaint filed by the forest department.

However, Singh's lawyer argued that his client was falsely implicated in the case. He claimed that Singh was not present at the spot where the leopard was hunted and that he had no involvement in the crime. The lawyer also pointed out that there was no direct evidence against Singh and that the case was based on circumstantial evidence.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court granted bail to Singh. The court observed that the prosecution had not been able to establish a prima facie case against Singh and that he was entitled to bail. The court also noted that Singh had no criminal antecedents and that he had cooperated with the investigation.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions on Singh while granting him bail. Singh was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. He was also directed to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the court as and when required. The court further ordered Singh to comply with the conditions of Section 437 of the Cr.P.C., which require the accused to not leave the country without the permission of the court and to not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Shailesh Singh, who was accused of hunting a leopard. The court observed that the prosecution had not been able to establish a prima facie case against Singh and that he was entitled to bail. However, the court has imposed certain conditions on Singh while granting him bail to ensure his presence during trial and compliance with the conditions of Section 437 of the Cr.P.C.
