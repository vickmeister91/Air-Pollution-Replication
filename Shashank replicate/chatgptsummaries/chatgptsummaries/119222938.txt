On January 4, 2018, the court admitted the case of Tilakdhari Singh vs The State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner's counsel requested bail for Munnilal, who had been convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment. The court granted bail to Munnilal on the grounds that he had already served more than two months of his sentence and had deposited the fine amount and furnished a personal bond.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals and birds, and also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In the case of Munnilal, he had been convicted under Section 9 of the Act, which prohibits hunting of wild animals. The punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a term of three to seven years and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees. Munnilal had been sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and had also been fined ten thousand rupees.

The petitioner's counsel argued that Munnilal had already served more than two months of his sentence and had deposited the fine amount and furnished a personal bond. The counsel also argued that Munnilal was not a habitual offender and had no previous criminal record. The counsel further argued that Munnilal was a poor farmer and had a family to support, and that his continued detention would cause undue hardship to his family.

The court considered the arguments of the petitioner's counsel and granted bail to Munnilal. The court noted that Munnilal had already served more than two months of his sentence and had deposited the fine amount and furnished a personal bond. The court also noted that Munnilal was not a habitual offender and had no previous criminal record. The court further noted that Munnilal was a poor farmer and had a family to support, and that his continued detention would cause undue hardship to his family.

The court recognized that Munnilal had already served a substantial portion of his sentence and had complied with the conditions of his bail. The court also recognized that Munnilal was not a threat to society and that his continued detention would cause undue hardship to his family.

The case of Tilakdhari Singh was to be considered later. It is not clear from the available information what the case of Tilakdhari Singh was about, but it is possible that it was related to the Wild Life Protection Act or some other matter connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.
