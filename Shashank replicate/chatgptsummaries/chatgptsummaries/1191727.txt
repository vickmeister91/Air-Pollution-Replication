The court order in question pertains to a challenge against an order to close down a leather factory until a proper effluent treatment system is established and certified by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner argues that the order is illegal as it violates provisions in the Code and that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate cannot pass a final order without a conditional order. The court agrees and quashes the impugned order, stating that a final order can only be passed on the basis of a conditional order. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate is free to initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with the provisions contained in Sections 133 to 138 of the Code, if circumstances so warrant.

The case at hand involves a leather factory that was ordered to be shut down until a proper effluent treatment system was established and certified by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner challenged this order, arguing that it was illegal as it violated provisions in the Code and that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate could not pass a final order without a conditional order. The court agreed with the petitioner and quashed the impugned order, stating that a final order can only be passed on the basis of a conditional order.

The court's decision was based on the provisions contained in Sections 133 to 138 of the Code, which outline the procedure for passing orders in cases of public nuisance. According to these provisions, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate can only pass a final order after issuing a conditional order and giving the person responsible for the nuisance an opportunity to comply with the conditions set forth in the order. If the person fails to comply with the conditions, then the Sub-Divisional Magistrate can pass a final order.

In this case, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had passed a final order without issuing a conditional order first. This was a violation of the provisions in the Code and rendered the order illegal. The court therefore quashed the order and directed the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with the provisions contained in Sections 133 to 138 of the Code, if circumstances so warrant.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions contained in the Code. It also highlights the need for proper effluent treatment systems in industries to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The decision serves as a reminder to industries to comply with environmental regulations and to authorities to enforce these regulations in a fair and just manner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a challenge against an order to close down a leather factory until a proper effluent treatment system is established and certified by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The court quashed the impugned order, stating that a final order can only be passed on the basis of a conditional order. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate is free to initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with the provisions contained in Sections 133 to 138 of the Code, if circumstances so warrant. The court's decision upholds the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions contained in the Code, and serves as a reminder to industries to comply with environmental regulations and to authorities to enforce these regulations in a fair and just manner.
