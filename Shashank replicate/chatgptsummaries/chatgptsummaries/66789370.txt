The Calcutta High Court recently issued an order in response to a petition regarding the operation of a mobile tower with a diesel generator set. The petition was filed by a tower owner who had been directed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to convert their diesel generator set to battery or solar power by May 2010. The tower owner had challenged this directive, arguing that it was not feasible to convert the generator set and that it would result in a loss of revenue.

The court, after hearing both sides, directed the tower owner to follow the guidelines issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and dispose of the writ application. The guidelines stated that no mobile tower company may install diesel generator sets and that all existing sets must be converted to battery or solar power by May 2010. A subsequent notification stated that entrepreneurs must follow guidelines for diesel generator use and phase out old generators by February 2011 or convert them to use bio-diesel.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the guidelines issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and emphasizes the need to reduce pollution caused by diesel generator sets. Diesel generator sets are commonly used by mobile tower companies as a backup power source in case of power outages. However, these sets are known to emit harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, which can have serious health impacts on people living in the vicinity of the tower.

The West Bengal Pollution Control Board's circular and subsequent notification were aimed at reducing the pollution caused by diesel generator sets and promoting the use of cleaner sources of energy such as battery or solar power. The guidelines also required entrepreneurs to follow certain norms for the use of diesel generator sets, such as ensuring that the sets are properly maintained and that they are not operated for more than a certain number of hours per day.

The court's decision to uphold these guidelines is a positive step towards reducing pollution and promoting cleaner sources of energy. It also highlights the need for mobile tower companies to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their impact on the environment. The use of battery or solar power as a backup source of energy can not only reduce pollution but also result in cost savings for the tower companies in the long run.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's order in response to the petition regarding the operation of a mobile tower with a diesel generator set is a significant step towards reducing pollution and promoting cleaner sources of energy. The court's decision to uphold the guidelines issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board emphasizes the need for mobile tower companies to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their impact on the environment. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a precedent for other states and encourage mobile tower companies to switch to cleaner sources of energy.
