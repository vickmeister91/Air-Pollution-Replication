In a civil suit filed by a former Member of Parliament against the General Manager of Telecommunications and others, the plaintiff sought to declare the disconnection of telephone connections as illegal and arbitrary and to restore the connections. The District Munsif referred the matter for arbitration under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1957 and directed the parties to maintain status quo. However, the Telecommunication Department argued that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration proceedings and not in a civil court.

The General Manager of Telecommunications and others filed a revision against the common order passed by the District Munsif. The court agreed with the Telecommunication Department and set aside the order passed by the District Munsif, stating that the only remedy for the affected person to resolve the dispute is through arbitration proceedings and the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

The Indian Telegraph Act, 1957 provides for the establishment, maintenance, and operation of telegraphs in India. Section 7-B of the Act deals with the settlement of disputes between the telegraph authority and any person. It states that any dispute arising out of the operation of the telegraph or any other matter connected with the telegraph can be referred to arbitration.

In this case, the plaintiff had approached the civil court seeking relief against the disconnection of telephone connections. However, the court held that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration proceedings as provided under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1957. The court further held that the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

The decision of the court is in line with the policy of the Indian government to promote arbitration as a means of resolving disputes. The government has taken several steps to promote arbitration in India, including the enactment of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which provides for the settlement of disputes through arbitration.

Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution where the parties agree to resolve their disputes outside of the court system. It is a faster and more cost-effective way of resolving disputes as compared to litigation. Arbitration proceedings are conducted in a private setting and the parties have more control over the process.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of arbitration as a means of resolving disputes. The Indian government has taken several steps to promote arbitration in India and the court's decision is in line with this policy. The decision also emphasizes the need for parties to carefully consider their options for dispute resolution before approaching the courts.
