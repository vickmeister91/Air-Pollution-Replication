The Andhra High Court recently heard two cases involving environmental impact assessments and the role of regulatory bodies in granting permissions for establishments that may generate pollution. In the first case, the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), a research laboratory established by the Indian government, had applied for land to set up its laboratory. However, a news article claimed that the laboratory would endanger two water bodies, prompting the A.P. Pollution Control Board to inspect the site and issue a notice to stop construction as the laboratory had not obtained the necessary permissions.

The CDFD then applied for consent and submitted an environmental impact assessment report, but the Board rejected the application due to a ban on establishments that generate pollution in the catchment of the two lakes. The CDFD appealed the decision, but the Appellate Authority upheld the Board's decision. The CDFD then approached the High Court, arguing that the Board had not conducted an adequate enquiry before rejecting the application.

The Court agreed with the CDFD and ruled that the Board had failed to make an enquiry before taking its decision. The Court also noted that the Board had not considered the fact that the laboratory was a government establishment and that the environmental impact assessment report had been prepared by a government agency. The Court ordered the Board to reconsider the application and make a decision within three months.

In the second case, a petitioner had submitted a Revised EIA report for dry operations, but the Board rejected the application based on the belief that the petitioner's activities would discharge sewage or trade effluent. The petitioner submitted a report from the National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute stating that they were a zero discharge establishment and did not generate pollution. However, the Board did not consider this report and should have done so.

The Court ordered the Board to reconsider the application in accordance with the law and make a decision within three months. The Court also referenced a previous case, Surana's case, where the Supreme Court referred scientific and technical aspects to expert bodies for investigation and opinion.

These cases highlight the importance of conducting thorough enquiries and considering all relevant information before making decisions that may have an impact on the environment. The Court's rulings also emphasize the need for regulatory bodies to follow the law and take into account scientific and technical aspects when making decisions.

In the first case, the Court's ruling that the Board had failed to make an enquiry before taking its decision is significant as it underscores the importance of due process and the need for regulatory bodies to follow established procedures. The Court's observation that the Board had not considered the fact that the laboratory was a government establishment and that the environmental impact assessment report had been prepared by a government agency is also noteworthy as it highlights the need for regulatory bodies to be impartial and objective in their decision-making.

In the second case, the Court's order that the Board reconsider the application in accordance with the law and make a decision within three months is significant as it emphasizes the need for regulatory bodies to follow established procedures and make decisions based on all relevant information. The Court's reference to Surana's case is also noteworthy as it highlights the importance of expert opinion in cases involving scientific and technical aspects.

Overall, these cases demonstrate the importance of environmental impact assessments and the need for regulatory bodies to follow established procedures and consider all relevant information when making decisions that may have an impact on the environment. The Court's rulings also underscore the need for impartiality and objectivity in decision-making and the importance of expert opinion in cases involving scientific and technical aspects.
