The court has granted bail to Gourav Khan, who has been in custody since June 2015 for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act and M.P. Vanopaj Vyapar Viniyam. The applicant's counsel argued that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case, and that other co-accused persons have been released on bail. The court allowed the bail application, directing the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one solvent surety in the same amount to secure his presence before the trial court on all hearing dates.

The case against Gourav Khan dates back to June 2015 when he was arrested for allegedly violating the Wild Life Protection Act and M.P. Vanopaj Vyapar Viniyam. He has been in custody since then, and his bail application has been pending before the court for a long time. The court finally granted him bail on the grounds that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case.

The applicant's counsel argued that Gourav Khan has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no evidence against him. He also pointed out that other co-accused persons have been released on bail, and therefore, Gourav Khan should also be granted bail. The court considered these arguments and allowed the bail application.

The court directed Gourav Khan to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one solvent surety in the same amount to secure his presence before the trial court on all hearing dates. This is a standard condition for granting bail, and it ensures that the accused person will appear before the court on all hearing dates.

The court's decision to grant bail to Gourav Khan is significant as it highlights the importance of the presumption of innocence. The court has recognized that Gourav Khan is innocent until proven guilty and has granted him bail on this basis. This decision also underscores the need for a fair and impartial trial, where the accused person is given a chance to defend himself and prove his innocence.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Gourav Khan is a welcome development. It upholds the principle of the presumption of innocence and ensures that Gourav Khan will have a fair and impartial trial.
