The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Sanjay @ Sultan Dulabhai Vyas under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The application was filed in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under sections 65(A) (E), 81 and 98(2) of the Prohibition Act. The court has allowed the application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail on certain conditions.

The conditions for the bail include executing a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and surrendering his passport. The court has also considered the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sanjay Chandra Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation. This indicates that the court has taken into account the precedent set by the Supreme Court in a similar case.

The Prohibition Act, under which the FIR was registered, is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain states in India. The sections under which Sanjay @ Sultan Dulabhai Vyas was charged deal with various aspects of the prohibition, including possession, transportation, and consumption of alcohol.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sanjay @ Sultan Dulabhai Vyas indicates that the charges against him may not be severe enough to warrant his continued detention. However, the conditions of the bail suggest that the court is taking measures to ensure that he does not flee the country or engage in any illegal activities while out on bail.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that Sanjay @ Sultan Dulabhai Vyas is innocent of the charges against him. It simply means that he will be released from custody while the case against him is ongoing.

Unfortunately, no information is provided about the second court order, so it is impossible to provide a summary of that order. It is important to note that court orders are legal documents that contain important information about legal proceedings. It is essential to have access to these documents to understand the details of a case and the decisions made by the court.
