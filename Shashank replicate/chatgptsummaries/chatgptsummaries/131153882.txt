The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Naveen Shyagoti and his mother Sunanda Shyagoti seeking to quash an order passed by the Sessions Judge allowing the prosecution to summon documents and witnesses for further evidence in a case against them. The petitioners argued that the judge erred in allowing the application under Sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. as the trial was already over and the case was posted for pronouncement of judgment. The prosecution argued that Section 311 permits such an application at any stage of the trial, including before the pronouncement of judgment.

The court examined the legal position and found that while normally such an application cannot be entertained once the matter is posted for pronouncement of judgment, in the interests of complete justice, it confirmed the order passed by the trial court. The court noted that the power under Section 311 is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously and in the interests of justice. The court also observed that the purpose of the provision is to enable the court to arrive at the truth and do complete justice between the parties.

The court further noted that the power under Section 311 is not unlimited and cannot be used to fill up gaps in the prosecution case or to introduce new facts or evidence which would prejudice the accused. The court also observed that the power under Section 311 cannot be used to recall a witness for further cross-examination unless it is necessary for the just decision of the case.

In the present case, the court found that the trial court had exercised its discretion judiciously and in the interests of justice in allowing the prosecution to summon documents and witnesses for further evidence. The court noted that the prosecution had sought to summon the documents and witnesses to establish the motive of the accused and to rebut the defence of alibi taken by the accused. The court found that the evidence sought to be adduced was relevant and necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also rejected the argument of the petitioners that the trial court had erred in allowing the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that Section 91 empowers the court to summon and examine any person as a witness or to produce any document or thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court observed that the power under Section 91 is wider than the power under Section 311 and can be exercised even after the pronouncement of judgment.

In conclusion, the court confirmed the order passed by the trial court allowing the prosecution to summon documents and witnesses for further evidence in the case against Naveen Shyagoti and his mother Sunanda Shyagoti. The court held that the trial court had exercised its discretion judiciously and in the interests of justice in allowing the application under Sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. The court also clarified that the power under Section 311 is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously and in the interests of justice. The court further observed that the power under Section 311 is not unlimited and cannot be used to fill up gaps in the prosecution case or to introduce new facts or evidence which would prejudice the accused.
