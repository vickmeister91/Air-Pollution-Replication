In a recent case, the validity of a notice issued by the Assistant Police Inspector, Economic Offences Branch, Nagpur, was challenged by the petitioner, Daleep Kumar. The notice was issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C and required the petitioner to produce a vehicle that he had purchased from the registered owner, who had allegedly taken a loan from the complainant and had not paid the installments. The petitioner argued that he was a bona fide purchaser and could not be held responsible for the registered owner's misdeeds. However, the court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the notice was valid and the petitioner had failed to show any provision of law that prohibited the issuance of such a notice.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of purchasing a vehicle from a registered owner who has outstanding debts. In this case, the petitioner argued that he was not responsible for the registered owner's debts and should not be required to produce the vehicle. However, the court held that the notice was valid and the petitioner was required to comply with it.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C, which allows the police to issue a notice requiring the production of any document or thing that may be necessary for the purpose of any investigation or proceeding. The court held that the notice issued in this case was within the scope of Section 91 and was therefore valid.

The petitioner's argument that he was a bona fide purchaser and should not be held responsible for the registered owner's misdeeds was also dismissed by the court. The court held that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he was a bona fide purchaser. The court also noted that even if the petitioner was a bona fide purchaser, he would still be required to comply with the notice issued under Section 91.

The case serves as a reminder to all purchasers of vehicles to ensure that they are not purchasing a vehicle from a registered owner who has outstanding debts. If a purchaser does purchase a vehicle from a registered owner with outstanding debts, they may be required to produce the vehicle in response to a notice issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of purchasing a vehicle from a registered owner with outstanding debts. The court held that a notice issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C requiring the production of a vehicle purchased from a registered owner with outstanding debts is valid and must be complied with. Purchasers of vehicles should therefore exercise caution when purchasing a vehicle from a registered owner with outstanding debts to avoid any legal complications in the future.
