The Delhi State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (DSIIDC) had appealed against a court order that quashed the cancellation of a plot allotment to Ashok Kumar Madan. Madan had applied for an allotment of a plot under a relocation scheme in 1996 and was found eligible for a plot measuring 150 square meters. The appellant issued a demand letter for payment, and Madan deposited an aggregate of 30% of the cost of a plot as indicated by the appellant. A draw of lots was held, and Madan was successful. The appellant issued the allotment letter and informed Madan that the cost of the plot stood revised. 

However, Madan failed to make the required deposit within the specified time, and the appellant sent a letter calling upon Madan to furnish proof of payment. Madan deposited the required amount, and an officer of the appellant corporation calculated the amount required to be paid by Madan, which was deposited by Madan. The appellant issued a letter informing Madan that the allotment of the plot in his favour stands cancelled. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition filed by Madan and quashed the letter cancelling the allotment of the plot. The DSIIDC appealed against the order, but the appeal was dismissed.

The court found that the appellant had retained funds deposited by the respondent for six years without attempting to return them. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs. The court dismissed the appeal in which the appellant claimed that a mistake was made by an officer.
