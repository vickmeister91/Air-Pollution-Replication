The case in question relates to the poaching of tigers in a national park and the illegal trade of their skin, bone, and other parts. The petitioner, Barlangfa Daimary, filed an application for pre-arrest bail under Sections 9/27/29/44/49(B)/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. However, the court rejected the petitioner's plea for pre-arrest bail, stating that the gravity of the offense and the incriminating materials in the case diary do not make it a fit case for extending the benefit of pre-arrest bail.

The Special Public Prosecutor argued that there are sufficient materials against the petitioner and that he has not been cooperating with the investigation. The court took note of this argument and observed that the petitioner's involvement in the poaching and illegal trade of tigers is a serious offense that cannot be taken lightly. The court also noted that the petitioner has not been cooperating with the investigation, which further strengthens the case against him.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife. It also prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

The Act provides for severe penalties for offenses related to the hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Section 9 of the Act provides for the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary or national park. Section 27 provides for the punishment for possession of any animal, article, trophy, or uncured trophy. Section 29 provides for the punishment for hunting in any other area. Section 44 provides for the punishment for the possession of any specified plant or part thereof. Section 49(B) provides for the punishment for the illegal trade in wildlife and their products. Section 51 provides for the punishment for the abetment of any offense under the Act.

In the present case, the petitioner has been accused of poaching tigers in a national park and trading in their skin, bone, and other parts. These offenses are covered under Sections 9, 27, 29, 44, and 49(B) of the Act. The court has taken note of the seriousness of these offenses and has refused to grant pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.

Pre-arrest bail is a provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, that allows a person to seek bail before arrest. This provision is available in certain cases where the person apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offense. The court may grant pre-arrest bail if it is satisfied that the person is not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence and that the person has a good case on merits.

In the present case, the court has refused to grant pre-arrest bail to the petitioner, as it is not satisfied that the petitioner is not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court has also observed that the incriminating materials in the case diary do not make it a fit case for extending the benefit of pre-arrest bail.

In conclusion, the court has rejected the petitioner's plea for pre-arrest bail in a case related to the poaching of tigers in a national park and the illegal trade in their skin, bone, and other parts. The court has observed that the gravity of the offense and the incriminating materials in the case diary do not make it a fit case for extending the benefit of pre-arrest bail. The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, provides for severe penalties for offenses related to the hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.
