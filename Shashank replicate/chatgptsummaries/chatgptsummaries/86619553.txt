The State of Rajasthan filed a series of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and another party regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries, or if the matter was covered by a previous judgment. 

The State argued that the matter was covered by a previous judgment, while the respondents argued that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries. After hearing both sides, the court ruled in favor of the State, stating that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries. The court ordered the impugned orders to be set aside and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. 

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the relevant laws and previous judgments. The court noted that the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and the notification of their boundaries. The Act also provides for the alteration of boundaries, but only under certain circumstances, such as for the better protection of wildlife or for the improvement of the administration of the sanctuary. 

The court also referred to a previous judgment in which it was held that the power to alter the boundaries of a wildlife sanctuary lies with the State government and not with the Collector. The court noted that the Collector had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act for altering the boundaries and had not obtained the necessary approvals from the State government. 

The court rejected the respondents' argument that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956. The court noted that the Land Revenue Act did not apply to wildlife sanctuaries and that the Wildlife Protection Act was a special law that would prevail over the Land Revenue Act in case of any conflict. 

In light of these findings, the court set aside the impugned orders and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. The court directed the Collector to follow the procedure prescribed under the Wildlife Protection Act and obtain the necessary approvals from the State government before altering the boundaries of the sanctuary. 

The court's decision has significant implications for the protection of wildlife sanctuaries in Rajasthan and elsewhere in India. It reaffirms the importance of following the prescribed procedures for altering the boundaries of wildlife sanctuaries and ensures that such alterations are made only for the better protection of wildlife or for the improvement of the administration of the sanctuary. The decision also underscores the need for a coordinated approach between the State government and the Collector in matters relating to wildlife sanctuaries. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in the petitions filed by the State of Rajasthan against the Collector of Bundi and another party regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary is a significant one. The court's ruling in favor of the State and its emphasis on following the prescribed procedures for altering the boundaries of wildlife sanctuaries will have far-reaching implications for the protection of wildlife in Rajasthan and elsewhere in India.
