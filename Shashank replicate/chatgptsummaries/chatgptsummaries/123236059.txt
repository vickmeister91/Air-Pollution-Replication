In a recent court order, Hargovind, who was accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act, was granted bail. The allegation against him was not of hunting the black buck, but of cooking and eating its meat. The court ordered Hargovind to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a separate surety of the same amount for his appearance in trial court. The court also directed him to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference.

In Hargovind's case, the allegation against him was not of hunting the black buck, but of cooking and eating its meat. This is still a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, as it involves the killing of a protected animal. However, the court deemed it fit to grant him bail, as the offense was not as serious as hunting or poaching.

The court ordered Hargovind to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a separate surety of the same amount for his appearance in trial court. This is a common practice in criminal cases, where the accused is required to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that they will appear in court for trial. If the accused fails to appear in court, the bond amount is forfeited.

The court also directed Hargovind to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for certain conditions that must be met by the accused while on bail. These conditions include attending court on all hearing dates, not leaving the country without the court's permission, and not committing any further offenses while on bail.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Hargovind, who was accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act by cooking and eating the meat of a black buck, was based on the nature of the offense. The court ordered him to furnish a personal bond and a separate surety for his appearance in trial court, and directed him to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. This case highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the consequences of violating laws that aim to do so.
