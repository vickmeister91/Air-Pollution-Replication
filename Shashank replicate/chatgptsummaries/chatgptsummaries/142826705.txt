The Karnataka High Court recently heard a criminal petition that sought to quash a complaint against M/S. The India Sugars and Refineries Ltd. The complaint was related to the company's failure to install wet-scrubbers to boilers and provide a closed shed to bagasse storage. The court accepted the petition and set aside the order, but with a caveat. The court stated that if the company does not install the scrubbers by September 30, 2013, the complainant can revive the complaint.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the company had already taken steps to address the issue. The company had submitted an affidavit stating that it had installed wet-scrubbers to the boilers and was in the process of constructing a closed shed for bagasse storage. The court noted that the company had taken these steps voluntarily and had not been directed to do so by any authority.

The court also dismissed an application by impleading applicants seeking the right of audience. The applicants had sought to be heard in the case as they claimed to have a stake in the matter. However, the court held that the applicants did not have any locus standi in the case and therefore could not be impleaded.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental compliance. The court's decision to set aside the complaint against the company was based on the fact that the company had taken steps to address the issue. This sends a message to other companies that they need to take environmental compliance seriously and take proactive steps to address any issues.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of due process. The court dismissed the application by impleading applicants as they did not have any locus standi in the case. This ensures that only those who have a direct stake in the matter are heard in court and prevents frivolous litigation.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision to accept the criminal petition seeking to quash a complaint against M/S. The India Sugars and Refineries Ltd. for not installing wet-scrubbers to boilers and providing a closed shed to bagasse storage is significant. The court's decision to set aside the complaint was based on the fact that the company had taken steps to address the issue voluntarily. The court's decision also highlights the importance of due process and ensures that only those who have a direct stake in the matter are heard in court.
