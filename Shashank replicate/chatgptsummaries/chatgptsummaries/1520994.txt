The court order pertains to the repair of a bund on land owned by the appellants, which is also a mangrove forest. The issue has been raised in three different applications filed by different parties alleging violations of orders passed by the court and the District Collector. The court heard arguments from all parties and noted that a civil suit is pending before the Bombay High Court. The court also discussed the validity of a notification issued by the Divisional Commissioner, which declared the land as a protected forest. The court ultimately disposed of all three applications by issuing directions to the parties involved.

The court order states that even if an order is void, it cannot be ignored by any person and must be declared void by a competent forum. The party aggrieved by the order must approach the appropriate forum for relief. The validity of a notification is pending consideration in a suit before the Bombay High Court, so the court cannot consider the submission raised by the appellants. The District Collector passed an order directing the appellants to remove the material used for filling to increase the height of the bund, remove the rubble dumped in the open land, and let the natural flow of sea water enter inside the land. Various reports from experts/officers reveal that the appellants have violated the conditions incorporated in the order of the District Collector, permitting them to repair the bund. The Committee made recommendations to stop all illegal work and remove the bund and road that have blocked the smaller creeks to prevent the destruction of mangroves. There have been flagrant violations of the order passed by the District Collector and the courts.

The court order pertains to the repairs of a bund site, where the permission holder has carried out massive filling work by dumping debris and garbage on the land. The permission was only to repair the existing bund, but the holder has constructed a new bund. The court has ordered that the permission holder shall not destroy mangroves and vegetation, not raise the height of the bund, and abide by the final orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The court has also established that the land in dispute has not been used for manufacturing salt for more than two decades, stands notified as a reserve forest, and requires protection.

The court order states that the appellants have violated a conditional order passed by the District Collector for repairing a bund. The violations include closing the natural flow of water, cutting/destroying mangroves, increasing the height and width of the bund, using big boulders and debris instead of mud, and dumping debris beyond the area of the platform. The court finds the appellants guilty of willful defiance of court orders and contemptuous conduct. They are directed to restore the bund to its original height and width within 60 days and to restore all culverts and drains that existed prior to the order. If they fail to comply, the District Collector will carry out the directions and recover the cost from the appellants. The court also requests the Bombay High Court to expedite the trial of the suit filed by the appellants.
