The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically Section 138, which deals with dishonoured cheques. In all cases, the accused was charged with issuing a cheque that bounced due to insufficient funds, and the complainant alleged that the cheque was issued to discharge a debt. However, the court found that the complainants had failed to prove that the accused had committed an offense under Section 138, and therefore, the accused was acquitted.

In the first case, Sri D.H. Rangaswamy had filed a complaint against Shri. B.H. Lakshmegowda for an offense punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Rangaswamy had advanced a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- to Lakshmegowda, who failed to repay it and issued a cheque that was dishonoured. However, the court found that Rangaswamy had not proved that Lakshmegowda had availed of the loan amount, and therefore, the accused was acquitted.

The court order in Crl.A.No.2402/2014 dated 13.11.2014 stated that if the complainant fails to prove the legally recoverable debt payable by the accused, the acquittal of the accused is proper. The burden of proof lies on the complainant to prove that D.H. Rangasway owed him Rs.3,00,000/-, but there was no evidence to substantiate this claim. The complainants had not produced any document to prove that D.H. Rangasway had mortgaged a portion of his house or that he possessed Rs.3,00,000/- on 18.11.2010. The complainants had mainly relied on lease deeds and salary certificates, which were not relevant to the alleged transaction. The accused had provided evidence that he was not in Bengaluru on 18.11.2010 and was on duty, which was supported by a duty certificate. Therefore, the accused was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

In the second case, the accused claimed that the cheque was issued as security for a chit fund, while the complainant alleged that it was issued to discharge a debt. The court examined evidence including attendance records and a cheque return memo and found that the complainant had failed to prove that the accused had issued the cheque to discharge a debt. Therefore, the court held that the accused had not committed an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

In the third case, the court ruled that the complainant had failed to prove that the accused committed the offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charge and must comply with the provisions of Section 437(A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court listed the witnesses and exhibits presented by both the complainant and the accused.

In all these cases, the burden of proof lay on the complainant to prove that the accused had committed an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and found that the complainants had failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the accused was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

It is important to note that the Negotiable Instruments Act was enacted to facilitate the use of negotiable instruments such as cheques, promissory notes, and bills of exchange in commercial transactions. Section 138 of the Act was introduced to deter people from issuing cheques that would bounce due to insufficient funds. However, the burden of proof lies on the complainant to prove that the accused had committed an offense under this section, and the court will examine the evidence presented by both parties before arriving at a decision.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically Section 138. In all cases, the accused was charged with issuing a cheque that bounced due to insufficient funds, and the complainant alleged that the cheque was issued to discharge a debt. However, the court found that the complainants had failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused was acquitted due to lack of evidence.
