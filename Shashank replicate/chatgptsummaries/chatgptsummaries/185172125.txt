The court order in question relates to a case involving dishonoured post-dated cheques issued by the accused, who had leased a property from the complainant. The accused claimed to have paid the rent in cash, but the court found that the lease deed clearly stated that the rent was to be paid through cheques. The court held that oral evidence cannot be used to contradict the terms of a written agreement.

The accused was charged under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques. The section provides that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable and punished with imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or with a fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.

In this case, the court found that the accused had issued post-dated cheques to the complainant for the payment of rent, but the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The court held that the accused had committed an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and convicted him accordingly.

The court also noted that the accused had not denied issuing the cheques, but had instead claimed to have paid the rent in cash. However, the court found that the lease deed clearly mentioned the cheques and that the accused had signed the lease deed, indicating his agreement to the terms of the agreement. The court held that the accused could not be allowed to go back on his agreement and that the terms of the lease deed must be upheld.

The court further held that the complainant had fulfilled all the requirements of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, including giving notice to the accused within 30 days of the dishonour of the cheques and giving the accused an opportunity to make the payment. The court found that the accused had failed to make the payment within 15 days of receiving the notice, as required by the Act.

The court also noted that the accused had not raised any defence to the complaint filed by the complainant. The court held that the accused had failed to discharge the burden of proof that lay on him to show that he had made the payment. The court held that the complainant had proved his case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the accused accordingly.

The court will now hear the accused on the point of sentence separately. The punishment for an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can be imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or with a fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. The court will consider the facts and circumstances of the case and the nature of the offence before deciding on the appropriate sentence.

In conclusion, the court order in this case highlights the importance of upholding the terms of a written agreement and the consequences of dishonouring cheques. The court has held that oral evidence cannot be used to contradict the terms of a written agreement and that the terms of the agreement must be upheld. The court has also held that the requirements of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act must be fulfilled before a person can be held liable for dishonour of cheques. The court will now decide on the appropriate sentence for the accused, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case.
