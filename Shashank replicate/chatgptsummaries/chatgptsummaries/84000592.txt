The State of Delhi has filed a criminal revision petition to challenge an order passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, which discharged the respondent, Kasim Mohd., from charges under Sections 63, 65, and 68-A of the Copy Right Act. The State argues that there is sufficient evidence to put him on trial, while the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate found that there was no conclusive evidence to support the charges.

The court notes that at the stage of considering the case for charge, the court is not required to meticulously judge the evidence or weigh the probable defense of the accused. The court cites previous cases to establish that if there is a strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offense, then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.

The court order discusses the judge's role in determining whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial. The judge must consider the broad probabilities of the case and any infirmities in the evidence, but should not make a roving inquiry or weigh the evidence as if conducting a trial. The order cites several cases to support this principle.

In the specific case at hand, the judge found that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not sufficient to proceed with a trial, due to poor quality photographs and lack of forensic examination of equipment. The investigating officer did not gather all necessary evidence and blindly accepted the complainant's assertion without serving notice or demanding formal proof.

The revision petition was dismissed and the trial court record was sent to the trial court.
