Ramdas Munjekar had challenged the orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and Additional Sessions Judge in the High Court of Bombay. The orders had rejected Munjekar's application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking intervention of the court in calling for documents listed in the application. Munjekar had argued that the orders were illegal, perverse, and arbitrary as they presumed certain facts that were not borne out from the record.

The High Court of Bombay found that the impugned orders did not consider the grounds taken by Munjekar appropriately and did not see the importance of the documents from the viewpoint of putting forward an effective defense. The court allowed the revision application and quashed the impugned orders. Summons to the witnesses were issued accordingly.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and Additional Sessions Judge did not take into account the grounds taken by Munjekar in his application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court found that the orders were illegal, perverse, and arbitrary as they presumed certain facts that were not borne out from the record.

The court also found that the documents listed in Munjekar's application were important from the viewpoint of putting forward an effective defense. The court's decision to allow the revision application and quash the impugned orders was based on these findings.

The court's decision to issue summons to the witnesses in accordance with Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was also based on the fact that Munjekar's application under Section 91 had been allowed.
