The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Joseph and Company seeking to quash an order by the government terminating their lease of 246.26 acres of reserve forest land in Nelliampathy, Palakkad district. The government had terminated the lease on the grounds of violation of lease agreement conditions and provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court examined the identity of the lessee and found that the government had treated Joseph and Company as the lessee. The court also examined the terms and conditions of the lease deed and found that the lessee had violated clause 14 by making a transfer without the previous permission of the lessor. The court held that the transfer was void ab initio and did not attract liability under clause 12.

The court quashed the termination order and directed the government to pass final orders. This decision was based on the fact that the transfer made by the lessee was not valid as it was made without the permission of the lessor. The court found that the lessee had violated clause 14 of the lease agreement, which clearly stated that any transfer of the leasehold rights must be made with the prior permission of the lessor.

The court also ordered the release of amounts due to the petitioner and quashed a previous order. This decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had fulfilled all the conditions of the lease agreement and was entitled to the amounts due to them.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of adhering to the terms and conditions of a lease agreement. Any violation of these terms can lead to the termination of the lease and legal consequences for the lessee. It also emphasizes the need for prior permission from the lessor before making any transfer of leasehold rights. Failure to do so can render the transfer void and attract legal liability.
