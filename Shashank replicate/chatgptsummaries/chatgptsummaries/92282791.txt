In a recent court order, the case of a high tension transmission line that caused the death of an elephant due to electrocution was addressed. The petitioner and four other employees of the Electricity Board were accused of causing the death of the elephant and charged under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court quashed the order taking cognizance of the offence, which was taken after seven years of the occurrence, as it was hit by Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court noted that the ground taken for condonation of delay was ignorance of law, which cannot be taken as a proper explanation. The court also observed that the petitioner and the other accused were not responsible for the maintenance of the transmission line and were not aware of the defect that caused the electrocution of the elephant. Therefore, the court held that the accused cannot be held liable for the death of the elephant.

The court further stated that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the accused. The court noted that the prosecution did not produce any evidence to show that the accused had any knowledge of the defect in the transmission line or that they had any intention to cause harm to the elephant. Therefore, the court held that the accused cannot be charged under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court also observed that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure for taking cognizance of the offence. The court noted that the prosecution had not obtained the necessary sanction from the competent authority before filing the charge sheet against the accused. Therefore, the court held that the charge sheet filed against the accused was invalid and quashed the same.

In conclusion, the court order quashed the order taking cognizance of the offence against the accused, as it was hit by Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court held that the accused cannot be held liable for the death of the elephant as they were not responsible for the maintenance of the transmission line and were not aware of the defect that caused the electrocution of the elephant. The court also held that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case against the accused and had not followed the proper procedure for taking cognizance of the offence. Therefore, the court quashed the charge sheet filed against the accused.
