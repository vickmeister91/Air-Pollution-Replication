The State of Rajasthan filed a series of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and another party regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries, or if the matter was covered by a previous judgment. 

The State argued that the matter was covered by a previous judgment, while the respondents argued that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries. After hearing both sides, the court ruled in favor of the State, stating that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries. The court ordered the impugned orders to be set aside and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. 

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the relevant laws and previous judgments. The court noted that the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provided for the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks for the protection of wildlife and their habitats. The Act also provided for the notification of the boundaries of these protected areas. 

The court observed that the notification of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary had been done in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The court also noted that a previous judgment had held that the boundaries of a protected area could not be altered without following the due process of law. 

The court further observed that the Collector had altered the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary without following the due process of law. The court noted that the Collector had not given any reasons for altering the boundaries and had not considered the objections raised by the respondents. 

The court held that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary without following the due process of law. The court ordered the impugned orders to be set aside and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reaffirms the importance of following the due process of law when it comes to the protection of wildlife and their habitats. The court's ruling ensures that the boundaries of protected areas are not altered arbitrarily and that the objections of all stakeholders are duly considered. The decision also serves as a reminder to government officials to act in accordance with the law and to respect the rights of all stakeholders.
