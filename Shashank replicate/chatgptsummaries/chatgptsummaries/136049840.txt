The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Chhabil Das against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication.

The court issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work.

The State was directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this direction. The court also requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case.

The State was directed to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for the purpose of preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removal of encroachments. The court warned that a cost of Rs. 50,000/- would be imposed if the State failed to comply. The District Collector, Ganga Nagar was directed to be present with all relevant records on the next date of posting. The State was directed to furnish copies of all compliance reports to the Applicant.

The High Court of Judicature of Rajasthan at Jodhpur issued an order on September 10, 2015, regarding the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas. A committee was formed to demarcate the encroachments and monitor their removal. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000.

The compliance report filed by the state government did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the state government to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, or face appropriate action. The court also directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal, which were causing contamination of canal water.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has given directions to the authorities to take action against the encroachers and recover compensation from them. However, the compliance reports submitted by the authorities were found to be inadequate, and the court has given them another opportunity to file a response.

The court has also directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide complete information and relevant records. The court has suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has cited relevant case law.

The court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy, if that is efficacious.

The court also notes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of this country and that the Tribunal possess ample power to condone the delay. The writ petition is dismissed with the liberty to the petitioner(s) to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015.
