The court has granted bail to Lala Ram, who was accused in a wildlife protection case. The decision was made on the grounds that his co-accused had already been granted bail and there was no evidence that Lala Ram would tamper with witnesses or flee. However, the court imposed several conditions on his bail to ensure that he would not interfere with the case or intimidate witnesses. 

One of the conditions of Lala Ram's bail was that he must not tamper with evidence. This means that he cannot destroy or alter any evidence related to the case. If he is found to have tampered with evidence, the court may take action against him, which could include revoking his bail and sending him back to jail.

Another condition of Lala Ram's bail was that he must not intimidate witnesses. This means that he cannot threaten or harass anyone who is involved in the case, including witnesses, jurors, or other parties. If he is found to have intimidated witnesses, the court may take action against him, which could include revoking his bail and sending him back to jail.

In addition to these conditions, the court also required Lala Ram to appear in court on all dates related to the case. This means that he must attend all hearings and trials, and cannot miss any court dates without a valid reason. If he fails to appear in court, the court may take action against him, which could include revoking his bail and sending him back to jail.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Lala Ram was based on several factors, including the fact that his co-accused had already been granted bail and there was no evidence that he would tamper with witnesses or flee. However, the court also imposed several conditions on his bail to ensure that he would not interfere with the case or intimidate witnesses. If he violates any of these conditions, the court may take action against him, which could include revoking his bail and sending him back to jail.
