The National Green Tribunal in Chennai recently heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore that were challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appeals were filed in response to orders issued on July 29, 2013. The companies argued that the orders were arbitrary and that they had not been given an opportunity to be heard. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was the sole respondent in all the appeals.

The court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The appellants argue that their units do not cause air or water pollution and have obtained necessary permissions. The Board, however, issued closure directions based on a government notification that prohibits industrial activity within 1 km of the Arkavathi river bank. The appellants argue that their units are located over 1 km away and that the government order is arbitrary and illegal. The court is tasked with determining whether the closure orders were issued in accordance with the law and whether the appellants were given an opportunity to be heard.

The court order states that the appellants in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ) obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts and that can be termed as illegally obtained. The Government of Karnataka issued a Notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities in the said zones. The Board has also prepared a map wherein Zone 3 specified the distance factor as 1 km from the river bank and the industries of all the appellants have been established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank and many of them even without obtaining consent for establishment. The court dismissed all the appeals and upheld the directions for closure of the industries of the appellants.

The court order pertains to the closure of industries under challenge, which were issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The order was issued in violation of FEE 215 ENV 2000 and a government order dated 12.01.2004, which were issued to protect the TGR catchment area. The Government of Karnataka had issued a Notification whereby the entire TGR catchment area was classified into 4 zones specifying the nature activities in each zone. The said Notification dated 18.11.2003 and a map prepared by the Board are produced as Annexure-R2 and R3. The court dismissed all the appeals and directed the appellants to remove all the machinery and materials along with the construction made by them for carrying on the activities within a period of 3 months.

In summary, the court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appellants argued that the orders were arbitrary and that they had not been given an opportunity to be heard. However, the court found that the closure orders were issued in accordance with the law and that the appellants had obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts.
