The court order in question pertains to a revision filed against the charge framed on two doctors under the Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994. The prosecution alleged that the doctors had not registered their ultrasound machine, maintained records, or displayed a notice prohibiting the disclosure of the sex of the fetus. The revisionist argued that the inspection report was inconsistent with the order, and the trial court failed to appreciate the scope of certain words under the Act. The court found that the order suffered from infirmity, and the accused were discharged due to inconsistencies in the inspection report, vague statements by prosecution witnesses, and incorrect addresses mentioned in the complaint.

The Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, was enacted to regulate the use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques for the purpose of detecting genetic or chromosomal abnormalities or certain congenital malformations or sex-linked disorders. The Act prohibits the disclosure of the sex of the fetus and mandates the registration of all ultrasound machines used for pre-natal diagnostic procedures. The Act also requires the maintenance of records of all pre-natal diagnostic procedures conducted and the display of a notice prohibiting the disclosure of the sex of the fetus.

In this case, the prosecution alleged that the two doctors had violated the provisions of the Act by not registering their ultrasound machine, maintaining records, or displaying a notice prohibiting the disclosure of the sex of the fetus. The trial court had framed charges against the doctors based on the prosecution's allegations. However, the revisionist challenged the charges on the grounds that the inspection report was inconsistent with the order and that the trial court had failed to appreciate the scope of certain words under the Act.

The court found that the order suffered from infirmity and that the accused were discharged due to inconsistencies in the inspection report, vague statements by prosecution witnesses, and incorrect addresses mentioned in the complaint. The court noted that the inspection report did not mention the make and model of the ultrasound machine used by the doctors and that the report did not indicate whether the machine was registered or not. The court also observed that the prosecution witnesses had given vague and contradictory statements regarding the registration of the ultrasound machine and the maintenance of records.

The court further noted that the complaint filed by the prosecution had incorrect addresses for the doctors and that the prosecution had failed to rectify the mistake despite being given an opportunity to do so. The court held that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the accused were entitled to be discharged.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of strict compliance with the provisions of the Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994. The Act is aimed at preventing the misuse of pre-natal diagnostic techniques for sex determination and ensuring that such techniques are used only for the purpose of detecting genetic or chromosomal abnormalities or certain congenital malformations or sex-linked disorders. The Act also seeks to ensure that the sex of the fetus is not disclosed, as this can lead to sex-selective abortions and other forms of discrimination against girls and women.

The court's decision also underscores the need for proper investigation and prosecution in cases involving violations of the Act. The prosecution must ensure that all necessary evidence is collected and presented in a clear and coherent manner, and that all procedural requirements are strictly adhered to. Failure to do so can result in the accused being discharged, as was the case in this instance.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of strict compliance with the provisions of the Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, and the need for proper investigation and prosecution in cases involving violations of the Act. The Act is a crucial tool in the fight against sex-selective abortions and other forms of discrimination against girls and women, and it is essential that it is enforced effectively to achieve its objectives.
