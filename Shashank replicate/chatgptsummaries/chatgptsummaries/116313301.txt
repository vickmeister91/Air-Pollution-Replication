The court has granted bail to Suramnath, who was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act in FIR No. 09-23/2019 of Regional Forest Officer, Nagaur. The bail is granted under Section 439 Cr.P.C. and the petitioner must execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference.

Suramnath was arrested for violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The specific nature of his offence is not mentioned in the court order, but it can be assumed that he was involved in some form of illegal activity related to wildlife.

The court has granted him bail under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). This section empowers the court to grant bail to a person who has been arrested for a non-bailable offence. However, the court can impose certain conditions while granting bail to ensure that the accused does not abscond or tamper with evidence.

In Suramnath's case, the court has imposed the condition that he must execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. This means that he must provide a guarantee that he will appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so until the completion of the trial. The sureties are also required to provide a similar guarantee.

The granting of bail to Suramnath is a significant development in his case. It means that he will be able to avoid spending time in jail while the trial is ongoing. However, it does not mean that he has been acquitted of the charges against him. He will still have to face trial and prove his innocence.

The court order does not provide any details about the evidence against Suramnath or the strength of the prosecution's case. It is possible that the court granted him bail because it did not find the evidence against him to be strong enough to justify his continued detention.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Suramnath is a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that helps to ensure that India's rich biodiversity is preserved for future generations. Those who violate the act must be held accountable for their actions, but they also have the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
