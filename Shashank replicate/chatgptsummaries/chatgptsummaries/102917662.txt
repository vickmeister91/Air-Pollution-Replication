The court order pertains to four writ petitions filed by individuals against Forest officials in Malappuram, Kerala. The petitioners had installed pipes to draw water from a river flowing through a reserved forest for agricultural operations. The Forest officials had passed an order to remove the pipes after receiving a complaint from other residents about water shortage in their wells. The court heard the cases and delivered a judgment.

In the first writ petition filed by Rejilal T.S. and others, the court heard the case along with another writ petition. The petitioners had installed pipes which were removed by the Forest officials. The court found that the Forest officials' order was violative of the principles of natural justice and arbitrary and illegal. The court quashed the order and directed the Forest authority to re-consider the issue after hearing all concerned parties. The authority was also directed to regulate the drawing of water for agricultural and drinking purposes, taking into account the availability of sufficient water in the upstream surplus of forest activities.

In the second and third writ petitions filed by residents of two Grama Panchayats, the court relied on facts and documents from a previous writ petition for disposal of the current petitions. The Forest officials had passed an order to remove the pipes installed by the petitioners to draw water from a river flowing through a reserved forest for agricultural operations. The court also mentioned contentions raised by the Forest officials that the petitioners were encroaching on vested forest land and had not obtained necessary permissions under forest conservation laws. The court ultimately concluded that agricultural operations are protected under the Kerala Forest (Conservation) Act and Rules, but non-forest purposes are not allowed without prior approval from the Central Government.

In the fourth writ petition filed by individuals who installed pipes in a forest to take water from Kottapuzha, a reserve forest, the court noted that the petitioners did not have permission to do so under the Forest (Conservation) Act or the Kerala Forest Act. The court also discussed the powers of the government under the Forest Act and the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting & Assignment) Act. The court ultimately concluded that agricultural operations are protected under the Kerala Forest (Conservation) Act and Rules, but non-forest purposes are not allowed without prior approval from the Central Government.

The court order states that agricultural operations are protected to a certain extent in a reserved forest area under the Kerala Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Rules, 1980. The exclusion made under Explanation to Sec.2 of Act, 1980 does not include laying pipelines. The court finds that the Forest authority's order is violative of the principles of natural justice and arbitrary and illegal. The court quashes the order and directs the Forest authority to re-consider the issue after hearing all concerned parties. The authority is also directed to regulate the drawing of water for agricultural and drinking purposes, taking into account the availability of sufficient water in the upstream surplus of forest activities. The writ petitions are disposed of accordingly.
