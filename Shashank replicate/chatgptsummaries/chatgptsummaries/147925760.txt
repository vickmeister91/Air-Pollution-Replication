The Delhi High Court has issued several orders involving the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and various real estate developers. The cases involve issues related to pollution control and environmental regulations. In one order, the court discusses a batch of 38 writ petitions challenging notices issued by the DPCC to the writ petitioners or penalties levied. The writ petitions have succeeded in part, and directions have been issued to DPCC to take action afresh and guided by the decision of the learned Single Judge. The buildings with respect to which action was proposed to be taken or was taken by DPCC are of three kinds: Residential Housing Complexes, Commercial Shopping Complexes, and Shopping Malls. The court discusses various provisions of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court order states that any person who established an industry, operation, or process before the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act of 1988, for which no consent was necessary, may continue to do so for three months from the commencement of the act or until the disposal of their consent application. If an industry, operation, or process is established without the consent of the State Board, the Board may serve a notice imposing conditions as it might have imposed on an application for its consent. The court order also includes definitions and restrictions on the use of certain industrial plants under The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The State Board has the power to issue directions to any person, officer, or authority, including the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry, operation, or process.

The court order discusses the power of a Board to issue directions to comply with the Water Act, including the regulation of industries and services. The court also discusses the expanded scope of the Water Act to include residential and commercial complexes, and the liability for water pollution caused by these complexes. The court concludes that the DPCC cannot levy penalties for non-compliance after buildings have been constructed, and instead should issue show cause notices and invoke powers under the Water Act. The court also notes the applicability of the Air Act.

In another order, the court discusses the applicability of the Air Act and Water Act to residential complexes, shopping complexes, and shopping malls. The court upholds that permission under the Air Act is required during the construction phase of residential complexes and for operating shopping complexes and malls. The court also upholds that prior consent from the State Pollution Board is necessary to establish any industry, operation, or process that is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent. However, the court disagrees with the learned Single Judge's view that constructing a building, whether for residential or commercial purposes, is an industrial activity. The court also emphasizes the importance of purposive construction in interpreting legislation.

The court order discusses the requirements for obtaining prior permission under the Water Act and the Air Act for establishing and operating industrial plants, including shopping malls and commercial shopping complexes. The court overrules the learned Single Judge's decision on the Air Act and declares actions initiated by DPCC pertaining to residential complexes as void. The court directs DPCC to inspect shopping malls and commercial shopping complexes for sewage and air pollution and issue notices requiring corrective action to be taken. The court also upholds the decision to refund penalties levied by DPCC as they were unconstitutional and not sanctioned by any power vested in DPCC under the Water Act or the Air Act.

In another order, the court states that the penalty levied by DPCC is unconstitutional and not sanctioned by any power vested in them under the Water Act or the Air Act. The decision to refund the penalty is upheld and the appeals filed by DPCC are dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own costs and all interim orders stand vacated.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining necessary permissions before establishing and operating industrial plants, residential and commercial complexes, and shopping malls. The court emphasizes the role of the DPCC in enforcing these regulations and the need for show cause notices and proper invocation of powers under the Water Act and the Air Act. The court also stresses the importance of purposive construction in interpreting legislation and upholds the rights of parties to challenge actions initiated by the DPCC.
