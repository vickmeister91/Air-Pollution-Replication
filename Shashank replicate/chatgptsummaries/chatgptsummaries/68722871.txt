The Madras High Court recently issued a court order involving two writ petitions filed by M. Sakthivel against the District Collector and other respondents. The first petition requested a writ of Mandamus to prevent the granting of a license to run a blue metal and bitumen tar mixing unit in Anjur village, Erode District, as it would affect the petitioner's life and livelihood. The second petition requested a writ of Certiorari to quash the proceedings of the third respondent granting a temporary license to the sixth respondent to run the same unit.

The court heard arguments from both sides and concluded that the third respondent did not have the power or authority to issue the temporary license. The court also noted that the sixth respondent could only run the unit after obtaining necessary permission from the Panchayat Union Council. The court order states that the sixth respondent did not have permission to run a blue metal and bitumen tar mixing unit under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. 

The Panchayat Union Council had rejected their request for a license, and although the District Collector had set aside the rejection, they had not issued a license. The Block Development Officer had also not followed the court's previous order to consider the sixth respondent's application for a license. 

The court has set aside the temporary license granted by the Block Development Officer and directed the District Collector to pass appropriate orders on the sixth respondent's application for a license, after giving an opportunity of hearing to all concerned parties. The petitioner and respondents 4 to 6 are also directed to cooperate in the enquiry proceedings.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary permissions before starting any industrial activity. The court has made it clear that temporary licenses cannot be granted without proper authority and that all concerned parties must be given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made.

The court's decision also underscores the need for local bodies such as Panchayat Union Councils to have a say in granting licenses for industrial activities. This ensures that the concerns of local communities are taken into account and that any potential negative impact on the environment and livelihoods is minimized.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder that industrial activities must be carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. It also highlights the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that due process is followed in all decision-making processes.
