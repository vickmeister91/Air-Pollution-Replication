The court order pertains to a civil suit filed by M/s Devyani Food Industries Limited against the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The plaintiff sought a declaration that a demand notice issued by the defendant was null and void and a permanent injunction against the defendant from recovering the demanded amount. The plaintiff argued that the demand notice was unreasonable and unjustified and that the defendant did not consider their representation and review letter. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and granted the reliefs sought.

In another court order, M/s Devyani Food Industries Limited filed a lawsuit against the Commercial Office of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The defendant argued that the suit was not maintainable because notice under Section 478 of DMC had not been served to them. The plaintiff sought a declaration that a demand notice issued by the defendant was null and void, and a permanent injunction. The court found that the suit was not maintainable because no notice had been issued, and therefore the plaintiff's claims for declaration and injunction were dismissed. The defendant did not present any evidence. The court examined the relevant laws and found that there was no exemption from the requirement of serving notice, and therefore the plaintiff's suit was not maintainable.

The plaintiff challenged a notice issued by the defendant on the grounds that the amount was calculated incorrectly and his representation was not considered. The defendant had issued the notice based on a circular that imposed damages on advertisements erected without permission. The court order states that the burden of proving the legality of the demand lies with the plaintiff. The court also notes that the circular and charges cannot be traced to any provisions under the DMC Act and that the impugned charges are not imposed pursuant to or in exercise of any statutory power under the DMC Act. The court concludes that the impugned charges and circular are without authority of law.

The court order further states that delegated authorities can only impose taxes or fees if there is a specific provision for it, and they must act strictly within the parameters of their delegated authority. The MCD does not have the power to levy charges, and the plaintiff's claim is not maintainable as no mandatory notice was served. The suit is dismissed, and a decree sheet will be prepared accordingly.

In summary, M/s Devyani Food Industries Limited filed a civil suit against the North Delhi Municipal Corporation seeking a declaration that a demand notice was null and void and a permanent injunction against the defendant from recovering the demanded amount. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and granted the reliefs sought. However, in another court order, the plaintiff's claims for declaration and injunction were dismissed as no notice had been issued. The plaintiff also challenged a notice issued by the defendant, and the court found that the impugned charges and circular were without authority of law. The court further stated that delegated authorities can only impose taxes or fees if there is a specific provision for it, and they must act strictly within the parameters of their delegated authority. The suit was dismissed, and a decree sheet will be prepared accordingly.
