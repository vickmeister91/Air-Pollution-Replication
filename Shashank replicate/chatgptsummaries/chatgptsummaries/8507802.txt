The court has granted anticipatory bail to Anil Pratap Singh, who was apprehending his arrest in connection with a wildlife protection act violation case. The prosecution alleged that Singh and other co-accused persons killed a female leopard by electrocution. Singh's first bail application was dismissed as withdrawn, and he argued that he was entitled to anticipatory bail on the principle of parity since co-accused Sandeepak Singh had been granted anticipatory bail. The court allowed Singh's application for anticipatory bail and directed him to abide by certain conditions upon his release.

The case against Anil Pratap Singh and his co-accused persons was related to the killing of a female leopard by electrocution, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The prosecution had alleged that Singh and his co-accused had set up an electric trap to kill the leopard, which is a protected species under the Act. The incident had taken place in a forest area in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Singh had filed his first bail application, which was dismissed as withdrawn. He then filed an application for anticipatory bail, arguing that he was entitled to it on the principle of parity since co-accused Sandeepak Singh had been granted anticipatory bail. The prosecution had opposed Singh's application, arguing that he was the main accused in the case and that he had a history of wildlife crimes.

The court, after hearing both sides, allowed Singh's application for anticipatory bail. The court noted that Sandeepak Singh, who was also a co-accused in the case, had been granted anticipatory bail by the same court. The court observed that there was no material difference between the cases of Anil Pratap Singh and Sandeepak Singh, and therefore, Singh was entitled to anticipatory bail on the principle of parity.

The court directed Singh to abide by certain conditions upon his release. The conditions included that he should cooperate with the investigation, not tamper with evidence, not leave the country without the court's permission, and not commit any similar offence while on bail. The court also directed Singh to furnish a personal bond and surety bond of Rs. 50,000 each.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Anil Pratap Singh has raised questions about the effectiveness of wildlife protection laws in India. The killing of protected species is a serious offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, and the punishment for such offences can range from imprisonment to fines. However, the implementation of these laws has been weak, and cases of wildlife crimes often go unpunished.

The case against Anil Pratap Singh and his co-accused persons highlights the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws in India. The killing of a female leopard is not only a violation of the law but also a threat to the survival of the species. The government and law enforcement agencies need to take a more proactive approach to prevent such crimes and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Anil Pratap Singh in connection with a wildlife protection act violation case has raised questions about the effectiveness of wildlife protection laws in India. The case highlights the need for stricter enforcement of these laws to prevent the killing of protected species and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Singh on the principle of parity with co-accused Sandeepak Singh has also been criticized by some, who argue that it sends the wrong message and undermines the seriousness of the offence.
