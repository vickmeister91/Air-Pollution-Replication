A property dispute case has been filed by the defendants, who are seeking modification of previous orders and suspension of rent until they obtain a license from the statutory authority. The property in question was let out for running a Banquet Hall, but the defendants have been in violation of the lease agreement. The court had passed a consent order in 2011, which directed the defendants to obtain all statutory permissions before running the Banquet Hall. The defendants are now seeking suspension of rent until they obtain the necessary licenses. The court has reserved its decision on the matter.

The plaintiffs failed to provide the sanctioned building plans, resulting in the defendants being unable to obtain necessary permissions and licenses for their banquet hall. The defendants claim that this failure caused them financial loss and they are entitled to a suspension of rent. The court hears arguments from both sides, with the defendants citing the Transfer of Property Act and previous cases to support their claim. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants were aware of the situation and that their demand for the building plans is an afterthought. The court also references previous orders and documents submitted by both parties.

The court order discusses a dispute between a landlord and tenant regarding unpaid rent and the tenant's request for remission of rent due to the landlord's alleged failure to provide necessary documents and approvals. The court rejects the tenant's arguments and finds that the lease agreement did not require the landlord to provide the documents and approvals in question. The court also notes that the tenant continued to occupy the premises despite the alleged lack of necessary approvals and therefore cannot seek remission of rent. The court cites a previous case to support its finding that the tenant's obligation to pay rent cannot be disputed in a landlord-tenant relationship.

The court order states that a tenant cannot dispute the obligation to pay rent while occupying a property. The relationship between a landlord and tenant is based on the tenant's agreement to pay rent in exchange for the right to use and occupy the premises. The tenant may only set up defenses to justify suspension of rent payment, but once those defenses are rejected by the court, the obligation to pay rent is established. The court also notes that a consent order can only be impeached on the grounds of fraud or invalidation of the agreement. The present application for condonation of delay in re-filing the application is infructuous and no orders are required to be passed in this application. The case is dismissed with costs quantified at Rs. 20,000/-.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article revolve around property disputes and rental agreements. In the first case, the defendants are seeking suspension of rent until they obtain necessary licenses, while in the second case, the plaintiffs failed to provide the necessary documents and approvals, resulting in the defendants being unable to obtain the licenses. The court rejected the tenant's request for remission of rent in the third case, stating that the lease agreement did not require the landlord to provide the documents and approvals in question. The court also noted that the tenant continued to occupy the premises despite the alleged lack of necessary approvals and therefore cannot seek remission of rent. In the fourth case, the court stated that a tenant cannot dispute the obligation to pay rent while occupying a property and that a consent order can only be impeached on the grounds of fraud or invalidation of the agreement. The case was dismissed with costs quantified at Rs. 20,000/-.
