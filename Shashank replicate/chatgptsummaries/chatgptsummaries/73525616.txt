The court stated that this remedy could be an effective solution to the petitioner's problem and granted them the freedom to pursue it in accordance with the law.

The court also kept all contentions open, meaning that the petitioner could still argue their case in court if they were not satisfied with the outcome of the statutory remedy. This was an important aspect of the court's ruling, as it ensured that the petitioner had multiple avenues for seeking justice.

Ultimately, the court disposed of the writ petition, bringing an end to the legal dispute between the petitioner and the KSPCB.
