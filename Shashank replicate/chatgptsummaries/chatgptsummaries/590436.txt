The Madras High Court recently heard multiple writ petitions filed by engineering graduates who were prevented from continuing their M.E./M.Tech degree during the 2009-2010 academic year due to their enrollment in a full-time postgraduate program while working as lecturers in private engineering colleges. The court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioners arguing that the university had no power to punish them and that the punishment was discriminatory, while the university argued that the punishment was necessary to maintain standards in higher education. Ultimately, the court upheld the punishment, citing the regulations governing full-time study and the need for teachers to be role models.

The court order pertains to a case where students pursuing a full-time postgraduate program were also working as lecturers in private engineering colleges affiliated to a university. The university constituted a committee to investigate the matter and recommended action against the students who violated regulations. The university categorized the students based on the date of their resignation from their lecturership and imposed punishments accordingly. The court held that the categorization had a reasonable basis and was not arbitrary. The court also held that the university had the power to take action even in the absence of specific regulations and cited previous Supreme Court judgments in support of this.

In another case, the court order discusses a university taking action against an engineering college for violating norms set by the AICTE. The court held that since the university had not adopted the AICTE's regulations as their own, they had no power to disaffiliate the college. The court also found that the petitioners, who were working as lecturers while pursuing a full-time M.E./M.Tech program, had violated the mode of study prescribed under the regulation and therefore their punishment was valid. The court rejected the petitioners' argument that other candidates who were working in private organizations and deemed universities had not been penalized, stating that there cannot be any equality in an illegality. The court also granted liberty to one petitioner to make an appropriate representation regarding her resignation from lecturership. Ultimately, the writ petitions were dismissed with no order as to costs.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of adhering to regulations governing full-time study and the need for teachers to be role models. The court recognized the university's power to take action even in the absence of specific regulations and emphasized the need for reasonable categorization of students based on the date of their resignation from lecturership. The court also emphasized the importance of adopting regulations set by governing bodies such as the AICTE to avoid any confusion regarding the university's power to take action against violators.

Furthermore, the court's rejection of the petitioners' argument regarding the lack of penalties for other candidates working in private organizations and deemed universities emphasizes the need for equal treatment under the law. The court recognized that there cannot be any equality in an illegality and upheld the punishment for the petitioners who violated the mode of study prescribed under the regulation.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in these cases emphasizes the importance of adhering to regulations governing full-time study and the need for teachers to be role models. The court recognized the university's power to take action even in the absence of specific regulations and emphasized the need for reasonable categorization of students based on the date of their resignation from lecturership. The court also emphasized the importance of adopting regulations set by governing bodies such as the AICTE to avoid any confusion regarding the university's power to take action against violators.
