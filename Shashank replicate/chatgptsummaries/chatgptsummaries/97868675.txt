In the first case, the plaintiffs, who are partners in a business that manufactures washers for tractor parts in a residential area, filed an application for an interim injunction to prevent the defendants from disconnecting their electricity connection. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs' business is polluting and unauthorized, and that they have been allotted a plot to shift their industry from the residential area. The court was tasked with determining whether the plaintiffs were entitled to an interim injunction, which required a prima facie case, balance of convenience in their favor, and irreparable loss and injury if the injunction was denied.

The plaintiffs argued that they had been running their business in the residential area for several years and that disconnecting their electricity connection would cause them irreparable loss and injury. They also argued that they had not been given any notice or opportunity to be heard before the defendants decided to disconnect their electricity connection.

The defendants, on the other hand, argued that the plaintiffs' business was polluting and unauthorized and that they had been allotted a plot to shift their industry from the residential area. They also argued that the plaintiffs had been given notice and opportunity to be heard before the decision to disconnect their electricity connection was taken.

After hearing both parties, the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to make out a prima facie case for the grant of an interim injunction. The court noted that the plaintiffs' business was unauthorized and that they had been allotted a plot to shift their industry from the residential area. The court also noted that the defendants had given notice and opportunity to be heard before the decision to disconnect the electricity connection was taken. Therefore, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' application for an interim injunction.

In the second case, the Supreme Court of India directed that no industry in residential areas of Delhi shall be permitted unless it has obtained the necessary license and permission from the statutory authorities. The court also directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi not to register or grant licenses to any industry in non-confirming/residential areas. The plaintiffs, who were running an industrial unit in a residential/non-confirming area, had been allotted an industrial plot in the earmarked industrial area and were directed to shift their industrial activity to the industrial estate. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' application for an injunction against the statute.

The court held that the plaintiffs' industrial unit was located in a residential/non-confirming area and that they had not obtained the necessary license and permission from the statutory authorities. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had been allotted an industrial plot in the earmarked industrial area and were directed to shift their industrial activity to the industrial estate. Therefore, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' application for an injunction against the statute.

In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiffs' industrial activities were unauthorized and that they had been allotted a plot to shift their industry from the residential area. The courts also noted that the plaintiffs had not obtained the necessary license and permission from the statutory authorities. Therefore, the courts dismissed the plaintiffs' applications for injunctions. 

In conclusion, the courts in both cases upheld the principle that industrial activities in residential areas must be authorized and licensed by the statutory authorities. The courts also emphasized the importance of balancing the interests of the parties and ensuring that irreparable loss and injury are avoided. The decisions in these cases serve as a reminder to businesses to comply with the necessary regulations and obtain the necessary licenses and permissions before carrying out industrial activities in residential areas.
