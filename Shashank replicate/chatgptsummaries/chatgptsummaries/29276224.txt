The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the translocation or capture of Spotted Deers in and around Chennai, India. The first court order, filed by Mr. S. Muralidharan, seeks to prevent the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests & Chief Wildlife Warden from catching deer from the campus of the Central Leather Research Institute or any other places in and around Chennai. The petitioner claims that the area is home to several endangered species and that the absence of large predators has led to a large population of deer. The court has reserved its judgment on the matter.

The second court order pertains to a petition filed against the translocation of Spotted Deers from the campus of Anna University and IIT in Chennai. The petitioner argues that the deers have become accustomed to human habitation and are feeding on garbage, leading to health hazards. The petitioner also suggests that the authorities work with planning authorities to prevent the mushrooming of buildings and improve greenery in the area. The government pleader argues that the translocation is necessary to save the deers from multiple threats outside the Reserve Forest areas in Chennai, such as feral dog attacks, pollution, solid waste intake, and vehicle hits. The government pleader denies that crude methods are adopted for catching the deers and cites statistics to support the translocation.

The third court order discusses a writ petition regarding the capture and relocation of spotted deer in Chennai. The government argues that the relocation is necessary due to the shrinking of the deer's habitat caused by the establishment of various institutions. The petitioner argues that the deer have habituated to human population and consume plastics, leading to their death. The court examines the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Wild Life (Protection) (Tamil Nadu) Rules, 1975 and ultimately dismisses the writ petition.

The fourth court order discusses the translocation of Spotted Deers from urban areas to forest areas by the first respondent. The court finds that the translocation cannot be faulted with as the first respondent has experience in capture and relocation of straying wild animals. The court also notes that Spotted Deers possess natural instincts to survive in natural wilderness and are monitored for a month until they freely mingle with the existing local deer population. The court further notes that there are no specific guidelines on the manner in which Spotted Deers are caught for translocation. The court cites an article on the handling of deer for translocation.

The fifth court order dismisses a writ petition regarding the transfer/translocation of Spotted Deers from a campus, but requires the Forest Department to frame necessary guidelines for trapping/catching wild animals in a scientific and cautious manner. The court expresses concern about the shrinking of forest cover and natural habitat for wild animals and calls for periodical training to be imparted to officials enforcing forest laws. The first respondent is directed to file an affidavit on the condition of the translocated animals and guidelines for trapping/catching wild animals by January 21, 2020. No costs are awarded. The order is addressed to various government officials.

In summary, these court orders highlight the complex issues surrounding the translocation and capture of Spotted Deers in and around Chennai. While some argue that translocation is necessary to protect the deer from threats such as pollution and vehicle hits, others argue that the deer have become accustomed to human habitation and should not be removed from their current habitats. The court orders call for the Forest Department to frame necessary guidelines for trapping/catching wild animals in a scientific and cautious manner, and express concern about the shrinking of forest cover and natural habitat for wild animals. Ultimately, the court orders seek to balance the needs of the deer with the needs of the surrounding environment and human population.
