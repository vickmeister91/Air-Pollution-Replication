The court order in question pertains to a dispute over the transfer of a lease for coconut and tamarind trees. The petitioner, who is the daughter of the deceased leaseholder, had obtained the transfer of the lease in her name without notifying her siblings. When the siblings objected and requested the lease to be transferred to all legal heirs, the transfer to the petitioner was cancelled. The petitioner challenged this cancellation, claiming a violation of natural justice. However, the court ruled that since the transfer to the petitioner was also made without notice to the siblings, it was also invalid. The court dismissed the petition and ordered the third respondent to decide on the transfer after giving notice to all parties involved.
