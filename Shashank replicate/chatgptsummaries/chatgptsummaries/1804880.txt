The court recently dismissed a civil revision petition that was filed against the dismissal of an appeal. The court stated that the petitioner could not maintain the appeal due to an amended provision in the Code of Civil Procedure. The court explained that an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not appealable and can only be revised before the High Court. The court upheld the lower appellate court's decision to dismiss the appeal as not maintainable. The civil revision petition was dismissed with no costs.

The case in question involved a civil revision petition that was filed against the dismissal of an appeal. The petitioner had filed an appeal against an order passed by the trial court, which had dismissed the petitioner's application for amendment of the plaint. The lower appellate court had dismissed the appeal as not maintainable, stating that the order passed by the trial court was an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and was not appealable.

The petitioner had then filed a civil revision petition against the dismissal of the appeal. The petitioner had argued that the order passed by the trial court was not an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and was therefore appealable. The petitioner had also argued that the lower appellate court had erred in dismissing the appeal as not maintainable.

The court, however, did not agree with the petitioner's arguments. The court stated that the order passed by the trial court was indeed an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and was not appealable. The court explained that Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with questions that arise between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed, and that such questions can only be decided by the court that passed the decree. The court further explained that an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure can only be revised before the High Court and cannot be appealed.

The court also upheld the lower appellate court's decision to dismiss the appeal as not maintainable. The court stated that since the order passed by the trial court was not appealable, the appeal filed by the petitioner was not maintainable. The court further stated that the lower appellate court had correctly dismissed the appeal as not maintainable.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the civil revision petition filed by the petitioner against the dismissal of the appeal. The court stated that the petitioner could not maintain the appeal due to an amended provision in the Code of Civil Procedure. The court explained that an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not appealable and can only be revised before the High Court. The court upheld the lower appellate court's decision to dismiss the appeal as not maintainable. The civil revision petition was dismissed with no costs.
