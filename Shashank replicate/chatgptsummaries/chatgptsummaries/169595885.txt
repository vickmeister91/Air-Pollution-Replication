The Karnataka High Court recently passed two separate orders pertaining to criminal petitions filed by individuals against the State and the Range Forest Officer of Bhadra Wildlife Range. The petitions sought the quashing of orders rejecting their applications for the release of vehicles, gun license, and mobile phones seized in connection with FOC No.2/2016-17 of the Range Forest Officer.

In the first order, the court considered five criminal petitions filed by different individuals and was asked to pass appropriate orders directing the respondents to release the seized items to the petitioners. The court heard arguments from both parties and referred to previous judgments to arrive at its decision. Ultimately, the court directed the respondents to release the seized items to the petitioners.

In the second order, the court considered a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the CRPC seeking to quash an order rejecting the application for release of a vehicle seized in connection with a wildlife protection case. The court considered the arguments of both parties and referred to previous judgments to arrive at the conclusion that the petitioners should be granted liberty to file an application for release of the vehicle before the jurisdictional magistrate. The magistrate is directed to dispose of the application expeditiously within ten days and may impose conditions if deemed fit. The court also rejected an application for stay filed in all these petitions.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with seized items in criminal cases. The court's orders provide a clear path for individuals seeking the release of their seized items, while also ensuring that proper legal procedures are followed.
