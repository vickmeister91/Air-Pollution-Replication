Ayyan, along with two others, has been accused of hunting a male deer in a wildlife sanctuary, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. A criminal petition was filed by Ayyan seeking anticipatory bail in this case. The court order pertains to this petition.

The court has granted Ayyan anticipatory bail subject to certain conditions. One of the conditions is that Ayyan must appear before the investigating officer. This is to ensure that he cooperates with the investigation. Another condition is that Ayyan must execute a self-bond for Rs.50,000. This is to ensure that he does not flee from justice.

The court has also taken into consideration the fact that Ayyan's identity in the alleged offence is yet to be probed. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that Ayyan was involved in the hunting of the male deer. The court has also noted that Ayyan is implicated on the voluntary statement of the arrested accused persons. This means that there is no direct evidence against Ayyan.

The court has granted Ayyan anticipatory bail because it believes that he is not a flight risk and that he will cooperate with the investigation. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that Ayyan's identity in the alleged offence is yet to be probed.

The court's decision to grant Ayyan anticipatory bail is a significant one. It means that Ayyan will not be arrested in this case unless there is evidence to suggest that he was involved in the hunting of the male deer. This is a relief for Ayyan, who would have faced arrest and imprisonment if he had not been granted anticipatory bail.
