The court order in question relates to an application for urgent hearing filed by Jagat Bahadur Singh, whose truck was seized in connection with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the application and directed the release of the truck on interim custody, subject to certain conditions.

One of the conditions imposed by the court was that the applicant must furnish a supradnama in the sum of Rs. 15 lakhs with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sidhi. This was intended to ensure that the applicant had sufficient financial resources to cover any potential damages or fines that might be imposed in connection with the offence.

In addition to this, the applicant was also directed not to transfer, sell, alienate or create any third party interest with respect to the offending vehicle. This was to prevent the applicant from disposing of the truck in any way that might interfere with the ongoing criminal case arising out of Forest Crime No.6831/25.

Finally, the court ordered the applicant to produce the truck as and when required by the trial court during the trial, until the disposal of the criminal case. The applicant was also required to produce the truck to the confiscating authority until the final disposal of any confiscation proceedings that might be pending in the Forest Department.

Overall, the court order was intended to balance the interests of the applicant with the need to ensure that justice was served in connection with the offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. By allowing the release of the truck on interim custody, subject to certain conditions, the court was able to provide the applicant with some relief while also ensuring that the ongoing criminal case and any potential confiscation proceedings were not compromised in any way.
