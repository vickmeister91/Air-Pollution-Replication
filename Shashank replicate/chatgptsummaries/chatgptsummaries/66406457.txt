The court recently granted bail to Ganga Prasad Gwara, who had been accused of killing a Pangolin, an endangered species, and selling its scales in the black market. The accused had been in custody since May 2015, and this was his first criminal case. The court ordered him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount for his release. He was also ordered to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The case against Ganga Prasad Gwara was filed under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal listed in Schedule I, II, III, or IV of the Act. The Pangolin is listed in Schedule I of the Act, which provides the highest level of protection to the species. The Act also prohibits the sale, purchase, or possession of any part or product derived from a wild animal listed in Schedule I, II, III, or IV.

The accused was arrested in May 2015, after the police received a tip-off about his involvement in the illegal trade of Pangolin scales. The police conducted a raid at his residence and found a large quantity of Pangolin scales, which were estimated to be worth several lakhs of rupees in the black market. The accused was charged with offences under Sections 9, 39, and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

The accused had been in custody for over five years, and his bail application had been pending before the court for several months. The court considered various factors while deciding the bail application, including the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with the evidence.

The court noted that the accused had no previous criminal record and that this was his first criminal case. The court also observed that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period and that the trial was likely to take some time to conclude. The court further noted that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had not attempted to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

The court also considered the severity of the punishment for the offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The offence carries a maximum punishment of seven years' imprisonment and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000. The court observed that the accused had already spent over five years in custody and that the punishment for the offence was not likely to be more severe than the time he had already spent in custody.

The court also took into account the fact that the accused had a family to support and that his release on bail would enable him to take care of his family and earn a livelihood. The court, therefore, granted bail to the accused on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount for his release. The court also ordered him to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C., which include reporting to the police station at regular intervals and not leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Ganga Prasad Gwara, who had been accused of killing a Pangolin and selling its scales in the black market, was based on various factors, including the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with the evidence. The court's decision to grant bail was also influenced by the fact that the accused had no previous criminal record, had cooperated with the investigation, and had a family to support. The court's decision to impose conditions on the accused's release, including the requirement to furnish a personal bond and a solvent surety and to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C., was aimed at ensuring that the accused does not abscond or tamper with the evidence and that he appears before the court for trial.
