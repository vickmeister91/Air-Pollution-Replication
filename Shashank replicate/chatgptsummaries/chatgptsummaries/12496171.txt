Amar Singh, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Court of Additional Civil Judge & Judicial Magistrate, No.2, Dholpur, which refused to release his tractor and trolley bearing registration number MP-06-AB-6048. The tractor and trolley were seized as case property in FIR No.198/2018 registered at Police Station Maniya District Dholpur for offences punishable under Section 379 I.P.C., under Sections 29 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and under Sections 41 and 42 of the Rajasthan Forest Act.

The petitioner contended that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the alleged offences and were being used for agricultural purposes. He further argued that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was causing him immense financial hardship and was affecting his livelihood.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court observed that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the alleged offences and were being used for agricultural purposes. The court further noted that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was causing the petitioner immense financial hardship and was affecting his livelihood.

The court directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 with the trial court as a security deposit. The court further directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court proceedings as and when required.

In another case, the petitioner, Rakesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR registered against him at Police Station Kotwali, District Bijnor, for offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B I.P.C. The petitioner contended that the allegations made against him were false and baseless and that the FIR was registered with malafide intentions.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court observed that the allegations made against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further noted that the investigation was at a preliminary stage and that it was not appropriate to interfere with the investigation at this stage.

The court also observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the law and that he could approach the appropriate forum for redressal of his grievances. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and allowed the investigation to proceed in accordance with the law.

In yet another case, the petitioner, Rajesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to quash the order passed by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.1, Jhajjar, Haryana, whereby the court had rejected his application for discharge in a case registered against him for offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B I.P.C.

The petitioner contended that the allegations made against him were false and baseless and that there was no evidence to support the charges levelled against him. He further argued that the trial court had erred in rejecting his application for discharge and that the order passed by the trial court was liable to be set aside.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court observed that the allegations made against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further noted that the trial court had considered all the material placed before it and had come to a reasoned conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to proceed against the petitioner.

The court also observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the law and that he could approach the appropriate forum for redressal of his grievances. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and allowed the trial court to proceed with the trial in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the courts in these cases have taken different approaches based on the facts and circumstances of each case. While in one case, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property, in the other two cases, the courts dismissed the petitions and allowed the investigation and trial to proceed in accordance with the law. These cases highlight the importance of a thorough investigation and a fair trial in ensuring justice for all parties involved.
