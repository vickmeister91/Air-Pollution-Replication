In a recent court order, a repeat bail application filed by Ganesh Mongia was dismissed. Mongia has been in custody since February 2016 for allegedly killing a leopard by firing. The court considered the gravity of the offense and deemed it not suitable for bail.

The case against Mongia dates back to February 2016 when he was arrested for allegedly killing a leopard by firing. The incident took place in the forest area of Junagadh district in Gujarat. Mongia was booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the Indian Penal Code.

Since his arrest, Mongia has been in custody and has filed multiple bail applications. However, all of his previous bail applications have been rejected by the court. In his latest bail application, Mongia argued that he has been in custody for a long time and that there is no evidence against him. He also claimed that he is suffering from various health issues and needs medical attention.

The court, however, was not convinced by Mongia's arguments and dismissed his bail application. The court considered the gravity of the offense and noted that killing a leopard is a serious offense under the Wildlife Protection Act. The court also observed that the offense is non-bailable and that Mongia has been in custody for a long time because of the seriousness of the offense.

The court further noted that there is evidence against Mongia, including eyewitness accounts and forensic reports. The court also observed that the investigation is still ongoing and that releasing Mongia on bail at this stage may hamper the investigation.

The court's decision to dismiss Mongia's bail application is in line with the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, which considers killing a leopard a serious offense. The act provides for stringent punishment for such offenses, including imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Ganesh Mongia's repeat bail application is based on the gravity of the offense and the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court has considered the evidence against Mongia and the ongoing investigation and deemed it not suitable for bail. The decision is a reminder of the seriousness of offenses against wildlife and the need for strict enforcement of the law to protect endangered species.
