The case at hand involves a challenge to two orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Keonjhar, which directed the petitioner not to operate their mining lease until further clarification was received from the government. The petitioner had a mining lease for a mine located in Bholabeda under Barbil Tahasil in the district of Keonjhar. The lease had been extended for another period of 10 years, and an application for renewal of the lease was submitted by the petitioner before the concerned authority.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, requires prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. The petitioner argued that the mining lease was granted prior to the enactment of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and therefore, the Act would not apply to their lease. However, the Supreme Court held that the Act would apply to the petitioner's lease, as the lease was extended after the enactment of the Act.

The petitioner also argued that the orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer were arbitrary and without any basis. However, the Supreme Court held that the orders were passed in accordance with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and were not arbitrary.

The Supreme Court further held that the restrictions imposed by the orders shall be confined to only the virgin forest where mining operation has not commenced. The Court clarified that the petitioner shall be allowed to carry out mining operations in the areas where mining has already commenced, subject to compliance with the conditions imposed by the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court upheld the orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Keonjhar, and directed the petitioner to comply with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, in carrying out mining operations in the lease area. The Court also clarified that the restrictions imposed by the orders shall be confined to only the virgin forest where mining operation has not commenced.
