The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioners were accused of committing offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first petitioner was the owner of a hotel where a trophy of a wild animal was seized by the Forest Range Officer. The second petitioner was in charge of running the hotel. The petitioners filed a petition to quash the proceedings against them, arguing that there was no specific overt act alleged against them.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition partly, quashing the case against the first petitioner but allowing the case to continue against the second petitioner. The court observed that the first petitioner was merely the owner of the hotel and there was no evidence to suggest that he had any knowledge of the trophy being kept in the hotel. Therefore, the court quashed the case against him.

However, the court did not find merit in the argument of the second petitioner that there was no specific overt act alleged against him. The court noted that the second petitioner was in charge of running the hotel and therefore, had a duty to ensure that no illegal activities were taking place on the premises. The court also observed that the trophy was seized from a room that was under the control of the second petitioner. Therefore, the court allowed the case to continue against him.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the duty of care that individuals in positions of authority have towards preventing illegal activities from taking place on their premises. The court's decision also underscores the need for individuals to be aware of the activities taking place on their premises and to take steps to prevent any illegal activities from occurring.

In conclusion, the court order in this case serves as a reminder that individuals in positions of authority have a responsibility to ensure that no illegal activities take place on their premises. The court's decision also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of the activities taking place on their premises and to take steps to prevent any illegal activities from occurring.
