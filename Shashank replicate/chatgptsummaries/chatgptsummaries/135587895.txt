The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Sunil Kumar Samanta against the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and others regarding the closure of his auto emission testing center. The Pollution Control Appellate Authority had upheld the closure order, and the appellant had filed a writ petition before the High Court of Calcutta before withdrawing it and filing an appeal with the National Green Tribunal. The appellant filed a Miscellaneous Application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal, which was opposed by the respondents. The Tribunal examined the rival contentions and certain further facts before proceeding to examine the merit or otherwise of the appeal.

The court order discusses an appeal filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under the National Green Tribunal Act. The appellant had filed for condonation of delay, but the appeal was still filed beyond the outer period of limitation of 90 days. The court explains that the special limitation period provided under the NGT Act prevails over the general law of limitation, and the tribunal loses jurisdiction to entertain an appeal after the expiry of the special period of limitation. The court cites a previous case where it was held that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond a period of 90 days, even if a sufficient cause is shown and the provisions of the Limitation Act are excluded.

The court order discusses the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act to an application challenging an award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court held that the phrase "but not thereafter" in Section 34 amounts to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and therefore bars the application of Section 5. The court also emphasized the importance of the period fixed under Section 34 and held that an application filed beyond the prescribed period cannot be entertained. The order cites several cases to support its conclusion that the use of negative words in a provision implies a mandatory requirement and that the legislative command must take precedence over equitable principles.

The court order states that negative words in a provision indicate a mandatory command, while affirmative words may also imply a negative command. The language of Section 16 of the NGT Act is clear that the Tribunal does not have the power to condone delays exceeding 90 days. The court also explains the concept of limitation periods and how they are imposed by statutes to ensure fairness and expeditious trials. The NGT Act is a self-contained code that does not admit ambiguity with regard to the application of other laws. The language of Section 16 of the NGT Act excludes the application of the general law of limitation provided under the Limitation Act. The court concludes that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal beyond the total period of 90 days.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act in relation to the Representation of the Peoples' Act, 1951. The court held that exclusion can be by explicit language or necessary implication, depending on the self-contained code and intent of the legislature. The court also cites cases where specific exclusion was evident from the language of the provision or the absence of "delay-condoning sections" of the Limitation Act in the special statute. The court concludes that the NGT Act is a self-contained code with unambiguous provisions of limitation, clearly stating exclusion of the general law of limitation.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act to different statutes. It cites various cases where the general provisions of the Limitation Act were excluded due to the use of specific language in the statutes. The court concludes that the language of Section 16 of the NGT Act provides for an express exclusion of the Limitation Act and therefore, the benefit of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would not be available to the appellant. The court also emphasizes the principle of implied exclusion and the importance of giving full effect to the expressed intent of the law-giver.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act in relation to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act. The court concludes that the NGT Act is a self-contained code and the provisions of the Limitation Act are excluded. The court also notes that the consequences of not filing an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation are inbuilt in the NGT Act. The court emphasizes that the provisions providing for the period of limitation cannot be liberally construed to frustrate the purpose of such provisions. The court cites various judgments of the Supreme Court and High Courts to support its conclusion.

The court order in v. Managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others, Civil Appeal Nos. 8183-8184 of 2013 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 24868-24869 of 2011) dealt with the condonation of delay in filing an appeal. The court held that the law of limitation is a substantive law and has definite consequences on the right and obligation of a party to arise. The court also explained the distinction between mandatory and directory provisions in law. The court rejected the appellant's contention that the National Green Tribunal is the forum to which first appeal is provided against the orders specified in Section 16 of the NGT Act and that these provisions should be construed liberally. The court held that the provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act do not admit of any ambiguity or absurdity and should be interpreted in plain
