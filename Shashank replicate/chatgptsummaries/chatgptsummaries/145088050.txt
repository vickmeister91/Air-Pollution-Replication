In the case of H Hanumanthegowda vs The Manager, the claimant was awarded compensation of Rs. 36,000 for injuries sustained in an accident. However, the claimant was not satisfied with the amount and appealed the decision. The court reviewed the case and modified the award, increasing it to Rs. 45,000. The court also confirmed the liability of the respondents, meaning that they were responsible for the accident and the resulting injuries.

In addition to the increased compensation, the claimant was also awarded interest and costs. This means that the respondents were required to pay not only the increased compensation amount, but also any additional expenses incurred by the claimant during the legal process.

The court's decision to increase the compensation amount was likely based on a number of factors, including the severity of the claimant's injuries, the impact of those injuries on the claimant's life, and the financial burden placed on the claimant as a result of the accident. By increasing the compensation amount, the court sought to provide the claimant with a more appropriate level of financial support to help them recover from their injuries and move forward with their life.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of seeking legal recourse in cases where individuals have been injured as a result of someone else's negligence or wrongdoing. While the legal process can be lengthy and complex, it can ultimately result in a fair and just outcome for those who have been harmed. In this case, the claimant was able to secure a more appropriate level of compensation for their injuries, which will hopefully help them to recover and move forward with their life.
