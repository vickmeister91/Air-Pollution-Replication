In a recent court order, the court directed the call details of the accused and the prosecutrix to be called for better disposal of the criminal case. This order was passed despite the trial court's dismissal of the application. The court cited the case of Maria Margadia Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack De Sequeria through LRs, 2012 (3) SCALE 550, which held that the discovery of truth is the essential purpose of any trial or enquiry.

The court acknowledged that the call details may not directly show the consent of the prosecutrix, but it would be of help in deciding the case. The court emphasized that the call details could provide valuable information about the communication between the accused and the prosecutrix, which could help in determining the nature of their relationship and the events leading up to the alleged crime.

The court's decision to order the call details is significant because it highlights the importance of discovering the truth in criminal cases. The court recognized that the call details may not be conclusive evidence, but they could provide valuable insights into the case. The court's decision also shows that the judiciary is committed to ensuring that justice is served, even if it means going beyond the trial court's decision.

The court's decision is also in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties to a case be given a fair opportunity to present their case and that the decision be based on the evidence presented. By ordering the call details, the court has ensured that both the accused and the prosecutrix have an equal opportunity to present their case and that the decision is based on all available evidence.

In conclusion, the court's decision to order the call details of the accused and the prosecutrix is a significant step towards discovering the truth in criminal cases. The court's decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and shows the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that justice is served. While the call details may not be conclusive evidence, they could provide valuable insights into the case and help in determining the nature of the relationship between the accused and the prosecutrix. The court's decision is a reminder that the discovery of truth is the essential purpose of any trial or enquiry, and all efforts must be made to achieve this goal.
