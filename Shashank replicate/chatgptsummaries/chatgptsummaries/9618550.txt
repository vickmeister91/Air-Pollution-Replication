In a recent court order, the Madras High Court heard a criminal original petition filed by D. Kasi Viswanathan against the State represented by the Inspector of Police and Poologa Pandian. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in a criminal case. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately set aside the order of the Magistrate.

The petitioner had requested that the court summon certain documents listed in the petition within a week. However, the Magistrate had failed to do so, prompting the petitioner to file the criminal original petition. The court considered the arguments put forth by both parties and ultimately found in favor of the petitioner.

The court's decision to set aside the Magistrate's order was based on the fact that the Magistrate had failed to comply with the petitioner's request to summon the documents in question. The court found that the Magistrate's failure to do so was a violation of the petitioner's rights and therefore set aside the order.

The court's decision to set aside the Magistrate's order and direct him to summon the documents listed in the petition within a week is significant because it upholds the petitioner's right to access important documents related to the criminal case. This decision also serves as a reminder to lower courts to comply with requests made by petitioners in a timely and efficient manner.

Overall, the court's decision in this criminal original petition serves as an important reminder of the importance of upholding the rights of petitioners in criminal cases. By setting aside the Magistrate's order and directing him to comply with the petitioner's request, the court has ensured that the petitioner has access to the documents necessary to pursue his case. This decision also serves as a reminder to lower courts to comply with requests made by petitioners in a timely and efficient manner.
