The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by M/S Quantum Sales and Nitin Gupta against an order passed by a magistrate allowing the complainant's application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to lead additional evidence in the form of the accused banker. The court hears arguments from both sides and cites previous cases to determine the maintainability of the revision.

The petitioners argued that the magistrate's order allowing the complainant to lead additional evidence was illegal and without jurisdiction. They contended that the order was passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard and that it was based on irrelevant and extraneous considerations. They further argued that the order was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice and that it had resulted in grave prejudice to their case.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the magistrate's order was legal and valid. They contended that the order was passed after due consideration of the relevant facts and evidence on record and that it was necessary for the just and fair disposal of the case. They further argued that the petitioners had not been able to demonstrate any prejudice caused to them by the order.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, proceeded to examine the maintainability of the revision petition. It noted that orders passed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. were interlocutory in nature and were not amenable to challenge in a revision under Section 397 (2) Cr.P.C. unless they substantially affected the rights of the accused or adjudicated a particular aspect of the trial.

The court cited several previous cases to support its conclusion that orders passed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. were interlocutory in nature. It noted that such orders were passed during the course of the trial and were meant to ensure that justice was done and that the truth was ascertained. It further noted that such orders did not finally determine the rights or liabilities of the parties involved in the case.

The court then proceeded to examine whether the magistrate's order allowing the complainant to lead additional evidence substantially affected the rights of the accused or adjudicated a particular aspect of the trial. It noted that the order was passed during the course of the trial and was meant to ensure that justice was done and that the truth was ascertained. It further noted that the order did not finally determine the rights or liabilities of the parties involved in the case.

The court, therefore, held that the revision petition was not maintainable and dismissed it accordingly. It further stated that the regulations only affect the procedure and not the rights or liabilities of the parties involved in the case. The order was dated March 15, 2012, and a copy was to be sent to the trial court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by M/S Quantum Sales and Nitin Gupta against an order passed by a magistrate allowing the complainant's application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to lead additional evidence in the form of the accused banker. The court hears arguments from both sides and cites previous cases to determine the maintainability of the revision. The court rules that orders passed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. are interlocutory and not amenable to challenge in a revision under Section 397 (2) Cr.P.C. unless they substantially affect the rights of the accused or adjudicate a particular aspect of the trial. The court order dismisses the revision as not maintainable and states that the regulations only affect the procedure and not the rights or liabilities of the parties involved in the case. The order is dated March 15, 2012, and a copy is to be sent to the trial court.
