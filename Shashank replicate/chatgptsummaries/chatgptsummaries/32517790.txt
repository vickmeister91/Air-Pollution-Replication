The court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction against the defendant, who was planning to open a motor workshop and service station in a residential locality. The plaintiff alleged that this would cause noise and air pollution, as well as health hazards. The defendant contested the suit, claiming that the workshop would not cause any pollution and that he had made proper arrangements for drainage. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the plaintiff appealed and won, with the defendant being given two months to shift the workshop from the residential locality.

The plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction against the defendant's workshop, which was dismissed by the trial court. The plaintiff appealed to the lower appellate court, which accepted the appeal and found that the workshop was likely to cause pollution and health hazards to the residents. The lower court also found that the defendant had no right to convert the residential colony into a commercial one without permission. The court relied on the report of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, but the report was found to be unreliable as it did not record any statements from witnesses. The court found that the suit was within the provisions of Section 91 CPC and that the plaintiffs had the right to file the suit.

The court order states that a suit was filed seeking a permanent injunction against a workshop-cum-service station that was causing water and noise pollution in a residential area. The court found that the provisions of Section 133 Cr.P.C. (emergency proceedings) did not apply in this case as the cause of nuisance was already existing. The court also noted that the plea of Section 91 CPC (public nuisance) was raised for the first time in appeal and could not be entertained. The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower appellate court's decision to decree the suit.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction against the defendant's motor workshop and service station in a residential locality.

The court relied on the report of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, but the report was found to be unreliable as it did not record any statements from witnesses. The court found that the suit was within the provisions of Section 91 CPC and that the plaintiffs had the right to file the suit.

Finally, a suit was filed seeking a permanent injunction against a workshop-cum-service station that was causing water and noise pollution in a residential area.
