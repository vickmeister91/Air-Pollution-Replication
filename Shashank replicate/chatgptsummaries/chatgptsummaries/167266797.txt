The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Smt. Geeta seeking eviction of Sh. Ramesh Chand Tyagi and his sub-tenant from a property in Delhi under the Delhi Rent Control Act. The respondent was accused of not paying rent and subletting the property. The court dismissed the relief under Section 14 (1) (b) of the Act and deleted the sub-tenant from the array of parties. The only point of contention was the existence of arrears of rent, which the respondent denied. 

The court found that the respondent had not paid rent from 01.04.05 to 31.12.06 and allowed the petition. The court ordered an inquiry into the payment of rent for the defaulted period and future period. This decision was based on the fact that the respondent had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he had paid the rent during the disputed period. The court also noted that the respondent had not produced any receipts or other documents to prove that he had paid the rent.

The court's decision to dismiss the relief under Section 14 (1) (b) of the Act was based on the fact that the respondent had sublet the property without the consent of the landlord. The court found that the respondent had violated the terms of the lease agreement by subletting the property and therefore, he was not entitled to any relief under the Act.

The court also deleted the sub-tenant from the array of parties as there was no evidence to suggest that the sub-tenant had any interest in the property. The court found that the sub-tenant was not a necessary party to the case and therefore, he was deleted from the array of parties.

The court's decision to order an inquiry into the payment of rent for the defaulted period and future period was based on the fact that the respondent had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he had paid the rent during the disputed period. The court noted that the landlord had produced evidence to show that the rent had not been paid during the disputed period and therefore, an inquiry was necessary to determine the actual amount of arrears.

In conclusion, the court order in this case was based on the fact that the respondent had violated the terms of the lease agreement by subletting the property without the consent of the landlord and had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he had paid the rent during the disputed period. The court ordered an inquiry into the payment of rent for the defaulted period and future period to determine the actual amount of arrears.
