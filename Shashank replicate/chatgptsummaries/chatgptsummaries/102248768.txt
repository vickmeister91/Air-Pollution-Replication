In a recent court order, five applicants who had been in custody since July 26, 2015, for a forest crime registered under the Wild Life Protection Act were granted bail. The applicants were reputed citizens of the locality and had no criminal past. The case was triable by the Court of JMFC, and the presence of the applicants was no longer required during the investigation. The court allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order was effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it became ineffective.

The court's decision to grant bail to the five applicants was based on several factors. Firstly, the applicants were reputed citizens of the locality and had no criminal past. This indicated that they were not a flight risk and were likely to cooperate with the investigation. Secondly, the case was triable by the Court of JMFC, and the presence of the applicants was no longer required during the investigation. This meant that there was no need to keep them in custody any longer. Finally, the court allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., which provides for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the investigation or trial of an offence.

The court's order directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This was a standard requirement for the grant of bail and ensured that the applicants would appear in court when required. The order was effective until the end of the trial, which meant that the applicants would be released from custody until the trial was over. However, in case of bail jump, the order would become ineffective, and the applicants would be liable to be arrested again.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the five applicants was a reasonable one based on the facts of the case. The applicants were reputed citizens of the locality and had no criminal past, and the case was triable by the Court of JMFC, and the presence of the applicants was no longer required during the investigation. The court's order was also in line with the provisions of Section 439 of Cr.P.C., which provides for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the investigation or trial of an offence. The requirement for the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court was also a standard requirement for the grant of bail. Overall, the court's order was a fair and just one that balanced the interests of the applicants with the need to ensure that justice was done in the case.
