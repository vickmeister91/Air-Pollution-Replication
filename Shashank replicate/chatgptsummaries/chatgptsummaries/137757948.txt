This is a court order that disposes of 62 appeals/applications that raise common questions of law based on similar facts before the Tribunal. The case involves the State of Rajasthan handing over land to the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Limited for the purpose of setting up an industrial area. M/s Laxmi Suiting, a proprietorship concern, applied for a plot of land in the Heavy Industrial Area in Jodhpur and was allotted Plot No.20/5(1). The lease agreement contained clauses related to pollution control and the establishment of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). The applicant moved an application for obtaining consent to establish and operate the CETP, which was ultimately rejected by the Jodhpur Pradushan Niwaran Trust. The applicant submitted a representation to the Trust, stating that the impugned action was discriminatory. The working of the CETP was found to be inappropriate and not functioning to its optimum capacity.

The court order states that a CETP (Common Effluent Treatment Plant) was operating improperly and not in accordance with the Water Act and Water Rules. The Board had ordered the unit to be closed down, but it continued to operate. The court is considering the legality of the orders passed by the Trust and the Board against the applicant. The Trust claims that the CETP has the capacity to take further load of trade effluents for treatment, but the reason for rejecting the consent of the applicants was the incorrect description and disclosure by the industries in relation to the discharge of effluents. The State of Rajasthan has not put up any specific reply or advanced any contention.

The court order discusses two separate applications challenging show cause notices issued by the Board under the Water Act. In one case, the applicant is not carrying on any business in the premises in question and has rented it out to different tenants. The court finds that there is no cause of action against the applicant and dismisses the application. In the other case, the applicant has installed anti-pollution devices and is compliant with regulations. The court directs the applicant to file a fresh application with the Board and Trust, which should be considered expeditiously. The court also discusses the provisions of the Water Act related to obtaining consent for discharging sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 25 of the Water Act, which prohibits any person from establishing or operating any industry or process that is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent without the previous consent of the Board. The Board may grant its consent subject to conditions and fix the duration during which such consent shall be operative. If an application for consent has remained pending for four months, it would be deemed to have been granted unconditional consent. However, the conditions stipulated in Section 25(7) must be strictly satisfied. The court also notes that Section 25(5) forms an exception to the deeming fiction created under Section
