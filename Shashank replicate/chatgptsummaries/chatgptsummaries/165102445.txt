The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Himendra Singh Tomar under section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Madhav National Park, Shivpuri, whereby the Tractor Trolley belonging to the petitioner has been directed to be confiscated. The vehicle was seized in forest offence No.236/2004 under Sections 35(8), 39(d), 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and the Chief Conservator of Forest has directed the vehicle to be the property of the Government under Section 39(1)(d) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

However, the court held that the order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest for forfeiture of the vehicle is unsustainable and quashed the impugned order, directing the tractor and trolley to be released in favour of its registered owner. The court observed that the order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest was not in accordance with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court noted that Section 39(1)(d) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 provides for the forfeiture of any property used in the commission of an offence under the Act. However, the court held that the Chief Conservator of Forest had not followed the procedure prescribed under Section 50 of the Act, which requires the officer seizing the property to prepare an inventory of the property seized and to give a copy of the same to the person from whom the property was seized.

The court also observed that the Chief Conservator of Forest had not given any notice to the petitioner before passing the order for forfeiture of the vehicle. The court held that the principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against him.

The court further held that the order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest was also in violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on his trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. The court observed that the petitioner was using the tractor and trolley for his business and the order for forfeiture of the vehicle would have a serious impact on his livelihood.

In light of these observations, the court held that the order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest for forfeiture of the vehicle was unsustainable and quashed the impugned order. The court directed the tractor and trolley to be released in favour of its registered owner.

This court order highlights the importance of following due process and the principles of natural justice while passing orders for forfeiture of property. It also underscores the need to balance the interests of conservation and livelihood while enforcing environmental laws.
