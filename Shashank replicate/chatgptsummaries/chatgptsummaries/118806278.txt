The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Jatinder Nath Mathur against the State of Haryana and another. Mathur had sought a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Board, which had ordered the closure of a pig farm run by Mathur due to alleged violations of the Water and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Acts.

Mathur claimed that he had not been served a show cause notice nor given an opportunity to be heard before the order was passed. The court took note of this and observed that the principles of natural justice require that a person against whom an order is sought to be passed must be given an opportunity to be heard.

The court disposed of the petition with a direction to the respondent-authorities to consider and decide Mathur's representation within 10 days after affording him an opportunity of hearing. This means that Mathur will now have a chance to present his case before the authorities and contest the allegations made against him.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that individuals are not unfairly targeted by government authorities. It also highlights the importance of due process and the need for authorities to follow established procedures before taking any punitive action.

Overall, the court's order is a positive development for Mathur and serves as a reminder to government authorities to act fairly and in accordance with the law. It also underscores the importance of individuals being able to defend themselves against allegations of wrongdoing and the need for authorities to provide them with a fair hearing.
