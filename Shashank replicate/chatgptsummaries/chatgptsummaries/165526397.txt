The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Shilpi Modes Private Limited against an order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in a criminal case. The revisionists had sought supply of statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. as recorded by the I.O. The learned ACMM dismissed the application of the revisionists on the ground that documents had already been supplied to the accused persons. However, the report of ACMM confirms that the copies of statement of witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C. had not been filed even with the charge sheet. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the learned ACMM for strict compliance of Sections 173 and 207 Cr.P.C.
