The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently admitted a revision for final hearing in the case of Sendilal vs The State of Madhya Pradesh. The applicants had been convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000. The applicants had already served two months of their sentence, and their counsel requested that their jail sentence be suspended and they be released on bail. 

The court granted the application, suspending the remaining jail sentence and directing the applicants to deposit the fine amount and furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety. The court also directed the applicants to appear before the Registry of the Court on specific dates during the pendency of the revision. The case was listed for final hearing in due course.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and biodiversity. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Act imposes strict penalties on those who violate its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

The decision of the court to grant bail to the applicants is significant as it highlights the importance of balancing the interests of justice with the rights of the accused. While the applicants had been convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act, they had already served a significant portion of their sentence and were seeking bail on the grounds that they had already undergone sufficient punishment.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is also in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that an accused person be given a fair trial and be presumed innocent until proven guilty. By granting bail to the applicants, the court has ensured that they will have the opportunity to defend themselves in the revision proceedings without being subjected to further punishment.

The court's decision to suspend the remaining jail sentence and direct the applicants to deposit the fine amount and furnish a personal bond with one surety is also significant as it ensures that the applicants will comply with the conditions of their bail.
