The court orders discussed the establishment of a modernized slaughterhouse in Chennai, which was a state-of-the-art plant that aimed to provide hygienic meat to the public. The Corporation of Chennai had denied allegations of denying employment to laborers and charging butchers for using the facilities. The modernized slaughterhouse had a capacity of 250 animals per hour, and the existing laborers were given the first shift. The third respondent had won the bid for the project and had fulfilled all commitments and provided additional facilities for the butchers. However, the butchers were not cooperating in moving to the new facility, which was affecting public health. The 3rd respondent had spent over Rs. 36 crores on the project.

The Perambur Meat Labourers' Association had filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, requesting a writ of mandamus to direct the Corporation of Chennai to prepare a proposal protecting and safeguarding the livelihood of the members of the petitioner association before commencing the service of the Perambur modern abattoir/slaughterhouse. The petitioners had argued that the modernization of the slaughterhouse would deprive the livelihood of thousands of people who were dependent on the existing slaughterhouse. The Corporation of Chennai had argued that the modernization of the slaughterhouse was necessary to meet the demands of hygienic meat in the city and that the new modernized slaughterhouse would not affect the livelihood of the local traders and butchers.

The court had ordered the Corporation of Chennai to protect the interest of the members of the petitioner's association and not to allow the 3rd respondent to convert the abattoir into cold storage or promote its own business interest. The court had also recorded the statements of respondents 2 and 3, which included the assurance to safeguard and protect the interests of the members of the petitioner association.

In the second court order, the petitioner association had approached the court seeking a direction to the second respondent to prepare a proposal protecting and safeguarding the livelihood of the members of the petitioner association before commencing the service of the slaughterhouse. The court had rejected the claim of the petitioner association and allowed the third respondent to proceed with the commissioning of the project.

Overall, the court orders highlighted the importance of balancing the interests of the public and the local traders and butchers while establishing a modernized slaughterhouse. The court had ordered the Corporation of Chennai to protect the interests of the members of the petitioner's association and ensure that the new modernized slaughterhouse did not affect their livelihood. The court had also emphasized the need for the butchers to cooperate in moving to the new facility to ensure public health and hygiene.
