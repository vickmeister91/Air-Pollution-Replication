The court order pertains to four different cases involving the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) and cheque fraud. In the first case, Shweta had filed an appeal against her conviction under the NI Act and the sentence, while Naresh Sharma had filed an appeal for enhancement of the punishment awarded to Shweta. The complaint was filed by Naresh Sharma, who alleged that Shweta had taken a friendly loan from him, which she failed to repay, and issued a cheque that bounced due to insufficient funds. The court considered the evidence and concluded that Shweta had taken a loan from Naresh Sharma and issued the cheque, which was dishonored, and convicted her. Shweta argued that no loan was taken from Naresh Sharma and that the cheque was a blank cheque given to another person. The court rejected her arguments and upheld the conviction and sentence.

In the second case, the court order states that the accused had issued a cheque to the complainant, which was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The accused did not deny her signatures on the cheque and had admitted to giving it to someone else. The court found all the ingredients of the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act to be proved. The accused's defense was that she had not taken any loan from the complainant, but the court found this defense to be false. The court also rejected the accused's application to lead additional evidence in respect of a receipt produced by someone else. The court explained the purpose of Section 138 of the NI Act and the presumption created under Section 139. The court noted that the accused had failed to discharge the burden of proving that the cheque was not in discharge of a legally enforceable debt.

In the third case, the accused was convicted for cheque fraud, but the complainant was unable to prove his financial liability to extend the loan to the accused. The accused claimed that the cheque was misused by a third party, but the court found her defense to be improbable and disbelieved it. The court also noted that the accused did not make any complaint about the misuse of the cheques and blank signed papers, which belied her defense. The court cited previous cases to support its conclusion that the accused's conduct showed due service of legal notice and that her defense lacked merit. The complainant filed an application to lead additional evidence to prove a receipt executed by the accused in favor of a third party for having taken a loan of Rs.2.6 lacs.

In the fourth case, the court order dismisses an application to lead additional evidence in a case involving a loan taken by the accused. The accused has been found guilty of an offense under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and has been sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2.75 lacs. The fine is to be paid to the complainant as compensation. The court rejects the complainant's appeal for enhancement of punishment and dismisses both appeals. The trial court record is to be sent back for execution of the sentence and realization of the fine amount.

In all four cases, the court has upheld the conviction of the accused under the NI Act for cheque fraud. The court has also emphasized the burden of proof on the accused to prove that the cheque was not in discharge of a legally enforceable debt. The court has rejected the accused's defenses in all cases where they have failed to discharge this burden of proof. The court has also noted the importance of due service of legal notice and the need for complainants to prove their financial liability to extend loans to accused persons. Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the legal consequences of cheque fraud and the importance of fulfilling legal obligations under the NI Act.
