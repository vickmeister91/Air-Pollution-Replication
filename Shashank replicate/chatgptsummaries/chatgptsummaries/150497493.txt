Shanker Singh Tomar, who was arrested on 26th June 2018 in connection with a case registered at police station STF Bhopal for offences under Sections 9, 39, 48A and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court allowed the bail application and directed Tomar to be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with separate surety in the like amount. 

The court also imposed certain conditions on Tomar, including not making any inducement or threat to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him, not leaving India without the court's permission, and not committing an offence similar to the one he is accused of. These conditions are standard for bail applications and are meant to ensure that the accused does not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

Section 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act deals with hunting of wild animals and birds. It prohibits hunting of any wild animal or bird specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV of the Act. Section 39 of the Act deals with confiscation of any vehicle, weapon, trap, or tool used for committing an offence under the Act. Section 48A of the Act deals with the power of the court to impose a penalty for offences under the Act. Section 51 of the Act deals with the power of the court to cancel any licence or permit granted under the Act.

It is not clear from the court order what specific offence Tomar is accused of, but it is likely that it is related to hunting of a wild animal or bird specified in Schedule I, II, III or IV of the Act. Schedule I of the Act includes animals like tigers, lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses, while Schedule II includes animals like leopards, bears, and crocodiles. Schedule III includes animals like deer, antelopes, and wild boars, while Schedule IV includes birds like peafowl, partridges, and quails.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act has been amended several times since then to strengthen its provisions and to provide for stricter penalties for offences under the Act.

In conclusion, Shanker Singh Tomar has been granted bail in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. He has been directed to comply with certain conditions, including not leaving India without the court's permission and not committing an offence similar to the one he is accused of. The Wild Life Protection Act is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect India's rich biodiversity and ensure that wild animals and birds are not hunted or poached for commercial or other purposes.
