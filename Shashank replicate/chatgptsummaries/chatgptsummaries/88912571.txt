Two court orders were issued in India regarding the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages. The first order was in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the Prani Mitra Samiti in West Bengal. The petitioner alleged that the use of PET bottles for bottling country liquor is harmful to the environment and makes the liquor unfit for human consumption. The State and PET bottle manufacturers opposed the petition, stating that PET bottles are safe and suitable for packaging alcoholic beverages and are permitted under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and the Food and Safety Standards Act. The Excise Department's policy also permits the use of PET bottles for packaging country liquor.

The court found that the petitioner had not approached the State or Central authorities for examination of the issue and that similar petitions had been dismissed by other High Courts. The court held that the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages is permissible to a certain extent and dismissed the petition. The court's decision was based on the fact that the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and the Food and Safety Standards Act permit the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages. The court also noted that the Excise Department's policy permits the use of PET bottles for packaging country liquor. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that PET bottles are harmful to the environment or make the liquor unfit for human consumption.

The second court order was in response to a writ petition filed in Madhya Pradesh regarding the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages. The petitioner argued that this would be unhygienic and hazardous to the environment. However, the court found that the Bureau of Indian Standards had already permitted the use of such bottles and there was no evidence to suggest that they were harmful. The court also noted that the scope of judicial review in policy decisions was limited and that no interference was warranted in this case. The petition was dismissed with liberty given to the petitioner to submit a representation to the Union of India if they wished to modify the standards fixed by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

In both cases, the courts found that the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages is permissible to a certain extent. The courts also noted that the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and the Food and Safety Standards Act permit the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages. The courts found that there was no evidence to suggest that PET bottles are harmful to the environment or make the liquor unfit for human consumption. The courts also noted that the scope of judicial review in policy decisions is limited and that no interference was warranted in these cases.

In conclusion, the courts in India have held that the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages is permissible to a certain extent. The courts have also noted that the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and the Food and Safety Standards Act permit the use of PET bottles for packaging alcoholic beverages. The courts have found that there is no evidence to suggest that PET bottles are harmful to the environment or make the liquor unfit for human consumption. The courts have also noted that the scope of judicial review in policy decisions is limited and that no interference was warranted in these cases.
