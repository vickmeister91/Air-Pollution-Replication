The Bombay High Court has ordered the State Government to file an affidavit explaining the action taken against those who violated Noise Pollution Rules during the Ganpati Festival of 2018 and Eid-E-Milad held on 21st February 2018. The court found that the police officer who filed the affidavit did not provide reasons for not taking action in 12 cases of noise pollution violations. The court directed the Commissioner of Police to file a personal affidavit explaining the action he proposes to take against the police officers responsible for not taking any action against the breach of Noise Pollution Rules. The affidavit must be filed by 2nd March 2019.

The court has also ordered the AGP to communicate the order to the Commissioner of Police and forward copies of affidavits filed by Shri Singe. The Commissioner of Police is instructed to investigate the failure of the Mumbai Police to take action against violations of Noise Pollution Rules and note that the State Government's Special Leave Petition has been dismissed. The petition will be placed on March 5th, 2019, at 3:00 pm for consideration of affidavits filed by the Commissioner of Police and Municipal Corporations.

The court's orders come in response to a public interest litigation filed by Awaaz Foundation, an NGO working towards the protection of the environment. The NGO had alleged that the Noise Pollution Rules were violated during the Ganpati Festival and Eid-E-Milad celebrations in 2018. The NGO had also alleged that the Mumbai Police had failed to take action against the violators.

The court's orders are significant as they highlight the importance of enforcing environmental laws and regulations. The court has directed the State Government and the Commissioner of Police to take action against those responsible for violating the Noise Pollution Rules. The court has also directed the Commissioner of Police to investigate the failure of the Mumbai Police to take action against the violators.

The court's orders are a reminder that environmental laws and regulations must be enforced to protect the environment and the health of the citizens. The court's orders also highlight the need for public awareness and participation in environmental protection. NGOs like Awaaz Foundation play an important role in raising awareness about environmental issues and holding the authorities accountable for enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

The court's orders are a positive step towards ensuring that environmental laws and regulations are enforced in the country. The orders also send a message to the authorities that they must take environmental issues seriously and take action against those who violate environmental laws and regulations. The orders also highlight the importance of public participation in environmental protection and the need for NGOs to play an active role in raising awareness about environmental issues.
