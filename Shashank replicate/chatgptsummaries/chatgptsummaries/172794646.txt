The Bombay High Court recently passed a judgment in a case filed by Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries and seven others seeking to quash a criminal case filed against them for contravention of provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioners argued that they had obtained environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment before commencing construction of a manufacturing unit in Dahej-SEZ. The court found that the complaint was misconceived as the clearance had been granted by the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and not the Central Government. The complaint was quashed, but the complainant was allowed to file a fresh complaint on the alleged breach.

The case pertains to the construction of a manufacturing unit by Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries and seven others in Dahej-SEZ. The complainant had alleged that the construction was carried out without obtaining the necessary environmental clearance from the Central Government. The petitioners argued that they had obtained environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment before commencing construction. The court found that the clearance had been granted by the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and not the Central Government. Therefore, the complaint was misconceived and was quashed.

The court observed that the complainant had not made any specific allegations against the petitioners and had merely relied on the fact that the environmental clearance had not been obtained from the Central Government. The court held that the complainant had failed to establish any prima facie case against the petitioners and that the complaint was misconceived.

The court also observed that the SEIAA was a competent authority to grant environmental clearance for projects falling within the purview of the SEZ Act, 2005. The court held that the SEIAA had granted environmental clearance to the petitioners after due consideration of the environmental impact of the project. Therefore, the petitioners had complied with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court further observed that the complainant was not precluded from filing a fresh complaint on the alleged breach. The court held that the complainant was at liberty to file a fresh complaint after taking into account the observations made by the court in the present case.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court quashed the criminal case filed against Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries and seven others for contravention of provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court found that the complaint was misconceived as the clearance had been granted by the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and not the Central Government. The complainant was allowed to file a fresh complaint on the alleged breach after taking into account the observations made by the court in the present case. The judgment is significant as it clarifies the role of the SEIAA in granting environmental clearance for projects falling within the purview of the SEZ Act, 2005.
