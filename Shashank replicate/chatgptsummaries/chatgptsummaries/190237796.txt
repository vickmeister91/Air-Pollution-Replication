Shankarappa had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to set aside an order passed by the trial court in C.C. No. 390/2008. The trial court had rejected an application filed by Shetty under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner had sought to produce a document marked as Annexure-A as evidence. The petitioner claimed that the document was a settlement agreement between the parties. However, the trial court had rejected the application as the complainant had denied the existence of any such settlement.

Shankarappa's petition before the High Court contended that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application filed by Shetty under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner argued that the trial court had failed to appreciate the fact that the document marked as Annexure-A was a settlement agreement between the parties. The petitioner further contended that the trial court had erred in relying on the complainant's denial of the existence of any such settlement.

The High Court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that there were no reasons to interfere with the trial court's order. The court observed that the trial court had considered the application filed by Shetty under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and had rejected it after considering the complainant's denial of the existence of any such settlement. The High Court noted that the trial court had also considered the fact that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to substantiate his claim that the document marked as Annexure-A was a settlement agreement between the parties.
