In a case where the petitioner sought a certificate of fitness to file an appeal in the Supreme Court against an order dismissing their petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court held that the order did not raise any important question of law and dismissed the applications. The petitioner had filed two applications, one under Section 340 Cr.P.C. and another under Section 91 Cr.P.C., seeking the prosecution of the investigating officer and others who had allegedly filed a chargesheet against the petitioner on false and fabricated evidence.

The court's decision was made on May 9, 2013, and the petitioner's application for a certificate of fitness was dismissed. This means that the petitioner is not entitled to receive it. The court's reasoning for dismissing the applications was that the order did not raise any important question of law. This means that the court did not find any legal issues that needed to be addressed in the case.

The petitioner's applications were filed under Section 340 Cr.P.C. and Section 91 Cr.P.C. Section 340 Cr.P.C. deals with cases where false evidence has been given in any stage of a judicial proceeding or before any public servant. The section allows for the prosecution of the person who gave the false evidence. Section 91 Cr.P.C. deals with the production of documents or other things necessary for the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under the Code.

In this case, the petitioner had alleged that the investigating officer and others had filed a chargesheet against them on false and fabricated evidence. The petitioner had filed applications under both sections seeking the prosecution of the investigating officer and others and the production of documents necessary for the investigation.

However, the court did not find any merit in the petitioner's applications and dismissed them. The court's decision was based on the fact that the order did not raise any important question of law. This means that the court did not find any legal issues that needed to be addressed in the case.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petitioner's applications for a certificate of fitness to file an appeal in the Supreme Court against an order dismissing their petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court's decision was based on the fact that the order did not raise any important question of law. This means that the court did not find any legal issues that needed to be addressed in the case. The petitioner is not entitled to receive a certificate of fitness.
