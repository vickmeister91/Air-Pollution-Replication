The Bombay High Court recently heard a Writ Petition seeking a Writ of Mandamus for various reliefs related to the issuance of occupancy certificates and refund of security deposits. The petitioners were a registered partnership firm and its managing partner, while the respondents were the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited, the State of Maharashtra, and the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation. The development in question consisted of two buildings with two wings each, and the approved plans were for Type 'A' and Type 'B' buildings. The court reserved judgment on September 11, 2019, and pronounced it on September 27, 2019.

The court order discusses a case involving two buildings, Type 'A' and Type 'B', and the issuance of an Occupation Certificate. The Type 'A' building has already been granted a certificate, while the Type 'B' building has only been granted a certificate for one wing. The petitioners have applied for a certificate for the remaining wing, but there are requisitions from the planning authority, CIDCO, including the need for an environmental clearance from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The MPCB had issued a stop work notice due to non-compliance with environmental regulations. The court order also mentions Section 44 of the MRTP Act, which outlines the requirements for permission for development.

The court order pertains to a show cause notice issued to Wadhwan by CIDCO, asking them to explain why their construction activities should not be shut down and why their electricity and water supply should not be disconnected. The affidavit in reply mentions several requisitions, including the need for environmental clearance, fire charges, water charges, unauthorised occupancy charges, and replenishing security deposit. The court notes that the petitioners must demonstrate a legal entitlement to relief and compliance with municipal or statutory norms. The court rejects several arguments made by the petitioners and declines to go into allegations of mala fides. The court also notes that the building cannot be issued an unconditional occupation certificate simply because it has been certified by the architect.

The court order rejects the petitioner's request for an unconditional occupation certificate for a building, stating that compliance with statutory and regulatory conditions and norms must be insisted upon. The court also criticizes the petitioner for making arguments about the official language of the state and seeking a waiver of compliance with the law. The petition is dismissed with no costs.

In summary, the court order deals with a Writ Petition seeking a Writ of Mandamus for various reliefs related to the issuance of occupancy certificates and refund of security deposits. The petitioners were a registered partnership firm and its managing partner, while the respondents were the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited, the State of Maharashtra, and the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation.
