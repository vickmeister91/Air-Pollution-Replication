The Bihar State Pollution Control Board has been at the center of a controversy regarding the issuance of an environment clearance certificate for establishing a Rolling Mill near a residential house in violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The complaint was filed against the office bearers of the board, and the case was taken up by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate. However, the court has now quashed the entire criminal proceeding, including the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate.

The reason for the quashing of the criminal proceeding is that the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on a private complaint without the complainant giving notice to the Central Government or the proper authority 60 days prior to filing the complaint, as mandated by Section 19 of the Act. The court held that the impugned order was perverse and had been passed without applying judicial mind.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection and improvement of the environment. The Act empowers the Central Government to take measures to protect and improve the environment and to prevent and control pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of the Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution Control Boards to implement the provisions of the Act.

Section 19 of the Act deals with the procedure for taking cognizance of offences. It provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Act except on a complaint made by the Central Government or the State Government or any officer authorized in this behalf by the Central Government or the State Government or a person who has given notice of not less than sixty days in the manner prescribed, of the alleged offence and of his intention to make a complaint to the Central Government or the State Government or the officer authorized as aforesaid.

In the present case, the court found that the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on a private complaint without the complainant giving notice to the Central Government or the proper authority 60 days prior to filing the complaint, as mandated by Section 19 of the Act. The court held that the impugned order was perverse and had been passed without applying judicial mind.

The court's decision to quash the criminal proceeding has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have criticized it as being too lenient on the office bearers of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The controversy surrounding the establishment of the Rolling Mill near the residential house is likely to continue, and it remains to be seen what steps will be taken to address the concerns raised by the complainant.

In conclusion, the court's decision to quash the criminal proceeding against the office bearers of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board for issuing an environment clearance certificate for establishing a Rolling Mill near a residential house in violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, has been met with mixed reactions. The court held that the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on a private complaint without the complainant giving notice to the Central Government or the proper authority 60 days prior to filing the complaint, as mandated by Section 19 of the Act. The controversy surrounding the establishment of the Rolling Mill near the residential house is likely to continue, and it remains to be seen what steps will be taken to address the concerns raised by the complainant.
