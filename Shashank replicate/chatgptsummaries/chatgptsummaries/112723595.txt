In the first court order, a private company had filed a writ petition against the Maradu Municipality and its Secretary after the municipality had directed the revocation of a building permit that the company had obtained. The municipality had found violations during an inspection and had issued a notice to revoke the permit. The company challenged the notice, and the court ultimately set aside the notice and allowed the construction to continue. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered previous judgments before ruling in favor of the company.

The second court order discussed a case where a building permit was revoked by the second appellant based on a notice issued by the first respondent. The court found that the notice did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 16 of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules (KMBR) and was fundamentally erroneous. The court also noted that the construction of the building was allowed to be completed during the pendency of the writ petition, and innocent purchasers have occupied the building. The court dismissed the writ appeals and clarified that in the event the second appellant is satisfied with the circumstances mentioned in Rule 16 of KMBR, it will be open to them to initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with the law. The court expressed its anguish about the manner in which the appellants conducted themselves.

In the third court order, four writ appeals were dismissed, and one was disposed of. The court stated that the municipality was to blame for issuing an inadequate show cause notice and that it was unclear if any disciplinary action had been taken against those responsible for issuing permits. 

In all three court orders, the issue at hand was the revocation of building permits by the municipality. The court in the first order ruled in favor of the private company, while the court in the second order dismissed the writ appeals and clarified the requirements of Rule 16 of KMBR. The court in the third order dismissed four writ appeals and disposed of one, highlighting the inadequacy of the show cause notice issued by the municipality.

The court in the first order considered previous judgments and heard arguments from both sides before ruling in favor of the private company. The court in the second order also considered the requirements of KMBR and noted that innocent purchasers had occupied the building. The court expressed its anguish about the conduct of the appellants in the second order. In the third order, the court criticized the municipality for issuing an inadequate show cause notice and questioned if any disciplinary action had been taken against those responsible for issuing permits.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of following the rules and regulations set forth by the municipality and KMBR when issuing building permits. The court emphasized the need for proper notice and adherence to the law when revoking building permits. The court also expressed concern about the conduct of the appellants in the second order and the lack of disciplinary action taken by the municipality in the third order.
