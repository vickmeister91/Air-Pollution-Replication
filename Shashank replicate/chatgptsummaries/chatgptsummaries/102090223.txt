The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed in public interest challenging the illegal and arbitrary manner in which the affairs of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) were being run by its Chairman. The petitioner argued that in the absence of non-notification of Section 16 of the PNGRB Act, the Board constituted under the said Act had no power to grant authorisation to entities which had applied to the Board for Laying, Building, Operating or Expanding City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks. The Chairman had allegedly delegated onto himself the powers of the Board to authorise entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks, the core powers and functions of the Board, without first obtaining any general or special order in writing as provided by Section 58 of the PNGRB Act. The court disposed of both writ petitions by a common judgment.

The court order discusses various issues related to the functioning of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). The Chairman of the Board is accused of turning the affairs of the Board into a one-man show and not recording dissent notes of members who objected to his arbitrary decisions. The delegation of essential legislative functions is also discussed, and it is argued that the core functions of the Board cannot be delegated. The conflict of interest of a member of the Board is also highlighted, and an inquiry is recommended. The order also mentions the direction of the Environment Pollution Authority to expedite the work of supply of CNG in Ghaziabad.

The court ordered RPB to write to Ghaziabad authorities to help IGL with the early implementation of the CNG supply project. The petitioner-IGL had conducted a feasibility report and obtained a No Objection Certificate for the development of a gas distribution pipeline for Ghaziabad. The pipeline was essential to cater to the demand of the upcoming Commonwealth Games. IGL had completed two CNG stations and purchased land for filling stations at Sanjay Nagar and Vaishali. The court heard arguments regarding the delegation of powers and the legality of the regulations issued in 2006. The court also heard allegations against Shri B.S. Negi. Sections 17, 19, 23, 24, and 48 of the PNGRB Act were discussed.

The court order states that contravention of certain provisions of the PNGRB Act can result in imprisonment or a penalty. The court also discusses the interpretation of certain sections of the Act and argues that the Board has the power to grant authorizations despite the non-notification of one section. The court also notes that the Board has delegated power to the Chairperson to make decisions on applications for authorization. The court rejects the argument that principles of natural justice were violated in the case.

The court reviewed the PNGRB Act and found that Section 16 is the source of power for the Board to issue authorizations, and without notification of Section 16, the Board does not have the power to issue authorizations. The court also found that Sections 17, 18, and 19 are procedural sections in aid of Section 16, and Section 19 only gives the Board the power to select an entity from amongst the entities which had applied to it for seeking authorization. The court held that any authorization given by the Board without notification of Section 16 cannot be termed as a valid authorization.

The court order states that the Board cannot grant valid authorizations as Section 16 of the PNGRB Act has not been notified by the Government of India. The order issued by the Board regarding IGL's application for authorization is set aside as IGL was not heard by the Board, violating the principles of natural justice. The court also cites previous cases to support the importance of personal hearing and the power of the Council to find a member guilty of misconduct. The court finds the Privy Council's decision inapplicable to the present case.

The court order states that a member accused of misconduct is entitled to a hearing by the Council before being found guilty, as the power to find and record guilt has been entrusted to the entire Council and not just a few members. The order also includes notings on a file regarding the processing of an application by Indraprastha Gas Limited, which was rejected by the Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board due to doubts about the company's sincerity and intentions. The notings show how the application was dealt with and the reasons for its rejection.

The court found that the delegation of essential functions to the Chairman of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) was contrary to the PNGRB Act, which requires collegiate decision-making by a multi-member board. The Chairman could not have delegated the core and essential function of the Board to himself, rendering the rest of the Board members redundant in the decision-making process. The court also found that the Chairman could not have further sub-delegated his power to someone else. The court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the public notice and order/letter dated 19th March 2009, directing the multi-member Board to pass an order on IGL's application after affording a personal hearing to IGL.

In summary, the court order pertains to two writ petitions filed in public interest challenging the illegal and arbitrary manner in which the affairs of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) were being run by its Chairman. The court found that the delegation of essential functions to the Chairman was contrary to the PNGRB Act, which
