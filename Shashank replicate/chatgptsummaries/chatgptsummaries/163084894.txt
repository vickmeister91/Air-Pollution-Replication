The Calcutta High Court recently heard four cases related to the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (the Board) and its employees. The first case involved an employee who was promoted to the post of Senior Environmental Engineer but was later reverted to the feeder post of Environmental Engineer. The petitioner alleged that the reversion was based on an erroneous procedure and was arbitrary and punitive. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the reversion, stating that the Board was bound to accept directives and instructions from the State Government and that the promotion was rightly cancelled.

In the second case, a petitioner challenged the cancellation of his promotion by the Member Secretary of the Board. The court noted that the Board acted on the direction of the State Government and violated the principles of natural justice. The court also observed that the Board did not follow the settled procedure for promotions and ignored several senior officers who were eligible for promotion. The court rejected the respondent's contention that no legally protected right of the petitioner was infringed and ordered the Board to conduct a fresh selection process considering the Service Rule of the State Government as well as the Board. The court also noted that the judgments cited by the respondent have no application to the facts of the present case.

The third case discussed the violation of natural justice principles in the case of a petitioner who was reverted to a feeder post without being given an opportunity to be heard. The court noted that exceptions to natural justice principles exist but can only be applied when the facts are indisputable and non-compliance with natural justice principles causes no prejudice to the party complaining. The court also highlighted the importance of autonomy for statutory bodies and noted that they should not feel bound by government directives merely because they are funded by the government. The court ultimately set aside the order of the Board due to the violation of natural justice principles and the Board's failure to exercise its own discretion.

The fourth case pertained to a situation where the Board had sought an opinion from a higher authority and interpreted it as a direction, without applying their own discretion. The court held that such interference by an external authority is contrary to the nature of the power conferred on the authority and set aside the order. The petitioner was directed to be restored to the promotional post with financial benefits within a specified time frame. The court did not order any costs and directed for urgent copies of the order to be supplied to the parties subject to compliance with formalities.

Overall, these cases highlight the importance of following proper procedures and principles of natural justice in matters related to promotions and reversion of employees. The court emphasized the autonomy of statutory bodies and the need for them to exercise their own discretion rather than blindly following government directives. The court also noted that exceptions to natural justice principles can only be applied in limited circumstances and when no prejudice is caused to the party complaining. These cases serve as a reminder to employers to follow proper procedures and principles of natural justice in all employment-related matters.
