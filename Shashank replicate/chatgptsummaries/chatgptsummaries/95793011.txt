The recent court order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Muralidharan, seeking a directive to euthanize an elephant named Rajeshwari, kept by the Arulmigu Suguvaneswarar Temple in Salem, Tamil Nadu, on humanitarian grounds. The petitioner claimed that the elephant was suffering from a serious painful disease and had developed bedsores. The court referred to Section 13(3) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and a circular of the Animal Welfare Board of India, which recommended euthanasia as a humane method of alleviating animal suffering in cases of incurable disease or injury or debility.

The court ordered that the Veterinary Officer in charge of the area where the elephant was being treated should examine her and, if the physical condition of the elephant was such that it would be cruel to keep her alive, she should immediately be administered euthanasia. The examination was to be conducted at the earliest, preferably within 48 hours, and the euthanasia was to be performed as per the rules, regulations, and guidelines with regard to the performance of euthanasia.

The order has sparked a debate on the ethical and moral implications of euthanasia for animals. While some argue that it is a humane way to end the suffering of animals, others believe that it is a violation of their right to life. The court's decision was based on the principle of compassion and the need to alleviate the suffering of animals.

The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, is a comprehensive legislation that aims to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on animals.
