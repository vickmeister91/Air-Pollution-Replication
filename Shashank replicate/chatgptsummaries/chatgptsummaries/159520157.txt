The court allowed the application and directed the applicant to be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety in the like amount.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions on the applicant. The first condition was that the applicant must cooperate with the investigation and trial. This means that the applicant must make himself available for questioning by the investigating authorities and must attend all court hearings related to the case. Failure to comply with this condition could result in the cancellation of the bail.

The second condition imposed by the court was that the applicant must not commit a similar offence while he is out on bail. This condition is meant to ensure that the applicant does not engage in any activity that is in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act or any other law related to the protection of wildlife.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant was based on several factors. The court noted that the applicant had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or that he would tamper with the evidence. The court also took into account the fact that the offence in question was a non-violent one and that the applicant had no prior criminal record.
