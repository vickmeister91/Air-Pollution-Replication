In a recent court order, Babu Ram, Kumbha Ram, and Jodha Ram were granted bail in connection with an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court directed them to execute a personal bond of Rs. 80,000 each with two sureties of Rs. 40,000 each to ensure their appearance before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife. The act also provides for the punishment of offenders who violate its provisions.

In addition, they will have to provide two sureties of Rs. 40,000 each who will also guarantee their appearance before the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is significant as it recognizes the importance of the right to bail. The right to bail is a fundamental right that is enshrined in the Indian Constitution. It is a right that is available to all accused persons, regardless of the nature of the offense they are accused of committing.
