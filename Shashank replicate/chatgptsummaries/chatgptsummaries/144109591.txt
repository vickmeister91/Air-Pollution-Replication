Two court orders have been issued in cases where the defendants have sealed the plaintiffs' properties. In the first case, the plaintiff, a tenant, filed a suit against the defendants for sealing his workshop without prior notice. The plaintiff alleges that the property in question is a Benami property and that the defendants have acted arbitrarily and unjustifiably. The defendants, on the other hand, claim that the sealing was done based on complaints received from the Monitoring Committee regarding pollution caused by the workshop.

The court has disposed of the application filed by the plaintiff and has ordered an interim injunction to remove the seal from the premises. The court has not made any decision on the ownership of the property, but has ordered the seal to be removed until the matter is resolved. The court has also directed the plaintiff to cooperate with the Monitoring Committee and take necessary steps to ensure that pollution is not caused by the workshop.

In the second case, the defendant sealed the plaintiff's property, a maternity home, citing letters from the Monitoring Committee seeking action taken reports. The defendant claims that the sealing was done in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions and that the property cannot be desealed. The plaintiff argued that the defendant failed to prove that the property falls under the "F" category of industries as per the Master Plan of Delhi, 2001.

The court dismissed the plaintiff's application for interim relief, stating that no prima facie case was made, and the balance of convenience did not lie in the plaintiff's favor. The court has not made any decision on the merits of the case, but has stated that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. The court has also directed the defendant to provide a detailed report on the sealing of the property and the reasons for it.

In both cases, the court has taken into consideration the complaints received from the Monitoring Committee regarding pollution caused by the properties. The court has directed the plaintiffs to cooperate with the Monitoring Committee and take necessary steps to ensure that pollution is not caused by their properties. The court has also directed the defendants to provide detailed reports on the sealing of the properties and the reasons for it.

The court has not made any decision on the ownership of the properties in question. The court has only ordered an interim injunction to remove the seal from the premises until the matter is resolved. The court has also directed both parties to cooperate with each other and with the Monitoring Committee to ensure that pollution is not caused by the properties.

In conclusion, the court orders in both cases have ordered an interim injunction to remove the seal from the premises until the matter is resolved. The court has also directed both parties to cooperate with each other and with the Monitoring Committee to ensure that pollution is not caused by the properties. The court has not made any decision on the ownership of the properties in question, but has directed the defendants to provide detailed reports on the sealing of the properties and the reasons for it.
