The case in question involves a petitioner named Mohd. Hussain, who challenged an order passed by the Special Judge NDPSCases, Pratapgarh in Sessions Case No. 13/2016. The order dismissed his application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to summon the call details and tower location of the mobile phones used by the members of the raid party. The petitioner had sought this information in order to support his defense in the case.

The court found that the petitioner did not provide any justifiable cause to justify summoning the call details or the tower locations. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any specific reasons for why this information was necessary for his defense. The court also noted that the petitioner had not shown that the information he sought was relevant to the case.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not shown that the information he sought was not available through other means. The court observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the information through other sources, such as by requesting it from the prosecution or by using other evidence to support his defense.

Based on these findings, the court dismissed the petitioner's application. The court advised the petitioner to raise his grievances before the trial court at the appropriate stage. The court noted that the trial court would be in a better position to determine whether the information the petitioner sought was relevant to the case and whether it was necessary for his defense.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing specific and justifiable reasons for seeking information through legal channels. The court emphasized that such requests should be made only when there is a clear and compelling need for the information and when it cannot be obtained through other means. The court's decision also underscores the importance of relying on other evidence to support one's defense, rather than relying solely on information obtained through legal channels.
