The court order pertains to a batch of writ applications challenging the validity of land acquisition by the Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha for setting up a thermal power plant by M/s. KVK Nilachal Pvt. Ltd. The judgment is confined to the issues raised in Category-IV, which is the challenge to lack of permissions and clearances for construction of the project, lack of forest clearance, and lack of wildlife clearance.

The petitioners allege that KVK has commenced construction activity without the necessary approval under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and any non-forest use of the land would require prior approval of the Central Government. The court has recorded the submissions of the parties and their respective objections.

The court order states that work on non-forest lands should not be started until approval for release of forest land is given by the Central Government. The petitioner argues that the Kapilash Wildlife Sanctuary is close to the site of the thermal power plant being constructed by KVK and clearance from the National Wildlife Board is required. The State Board for Wildlife has approved the proposal of KVK with certain conditions and recommended it to the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife. The Union of India submits that no final decision has been taken on the proposal for the buffer zone of Kapilash Wildlife Sanctuary and no clearance has been granted for forest land.

The court order discusses the issue of whether the KVK project requires wildlife clearance and forest land clearance. The KVK argues that they were not required to obtain wildlife clearance as there was no sanctuary within 10 km radius of the project at the time of grant of Environmental Clearance (EC). They also argue that the Office Memo dated 02.12.2009 of MoEF applies prospectively only to those cases where EC is to be granted after the issuance of the memo. The KVK had substantially acted on the EC by investing Rs. 975 crores on the project. The court also discusses the issue of forest land clearance and the KVK argues that the area was de-reserved and dis-forested as there was no valuable forest growth in the area.

The court order discusses a case where a PIL was filed against KVK for constructing a project on forest land. The court found that the land in question had been de-reserved and dis-forested in 1953, and the classification of the land had been corrected in line with this notification. The court also noted that the State Government had filed a petition for changing the classification of some forest land to non-forest land. The court found that the guidelines cited by the petitioner did not have the force of law and did not apply to private parties. The court allowed KVK to apply for clearance in respect of the land in question and undertake construction only after clearance is given.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a project involving both forest and non-forest land can proceed with construction on the non-forest land while awaiting clearance for the forest land. The court notes that guidelines on the matter are advisory and not mandatory, and that a previous court order allowed for construction on non-forest land pending clearance for forest land. The court also considers whether the location of a thermal power plant requires wildlife clearance before construction can proceed. The parties present arguments and evidence on both issues.

The court order discusses a case where authorities started work on non-forest lands before receiving approval for the release of forest lands required for the project. The court determined that work should not be started on non-forest land until approval for the release of forest land has been given. The order also discusses the correction of land classification in the ROR and the fact that no trees or construction exist on the private forest kissam land purchased by KVK. The court allowed KVK to carry on leveling work but not construction work without leave of the court.

The court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership and construction of a thermal power plant by KVK. The state has not yet handed over the land to KVK, and there are pending applications for correction of land records. KVK has given an undertaking not to carry out any construction activity on the disputed forest land until forest clearance is obtained. The court has considered various judgments and guidelines related to forest land and buffer zones and has allowed KVK to proceed with construction activities, subject to necessary approvals from the Wildlife Board. The court has also dismissed two other petitions related to land ownership and affirmed an order rejecting objections to the alienation of government land in favor of IDCO.

The court order dismisses two petitions and declares that the Forest Conservation Act does not apply to lands purchased by the petitioner. The court also allows a petition to quash a notice issued by the Tahasildar. The order is affirmed by the learned Single Judge. The writ applications are disposed of according to the directions noted in the order.

In summary, the court order pertains to a batch of writ applications challenging the validity of land acquisition by the Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha for setting up a thermal power plant by M/s. KVK Nilachal Pvt. Ltd. The judgment is confined to the issues raised in Category-IV, which is the challenge to lack of permissions and clearances for construction of the project, lack of forest clearance, and lack of wildlife clearance.
