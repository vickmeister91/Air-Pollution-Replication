The Sinhagad Technical Education Society claimed ownership of lands in Pune and planned to set up a golf course on them. However, the Forest Department objected, stating that the lands were private forests and required permission from the Union of India for non-forest activities. The Society argued that one of the lands had been restored to its original owner without any restrictions on use. The court reserved judgment on the case on December 24, 2014, and pronounced it on February 3, 2015.

The court order states that the land bearing Gat No.311 has been restored to its original owner without any restrictions on its use. The petitioner intends to set up a golf course on the lands bearing Gat Nos.310 and 311 and has filed a petition to quash an impugned notification and for a direction to the respondents not to obstruct the project. An affidavit-in-reply has been filed by the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pune Forest Division, Pune, stating that the lands subject to the notice became private forests which stood vested in the State with effect from 30th August 1975. The lands bearing Gat Nos.311, 312, and 314 were restored back to the original owner, but the lands would still be governed by the provisions of the said Act of 1927.

The court order discusses a dispute over the classification of certain lands as private forests under the Maharashtra Private Forests Act of 1975. The petitioner argues that a notice issued in 1958 is insufficient to classify the lands as private forests, while the respondents argue that the lands are subject to the Act and cannot be used for non-forest activities without permission from the government. The court considers the arguments and factual evidence presented by both sides.

The court order discusses the withdrawal of an application and the restoration of lands under the Forest Act of 1927 and the Forest Conservation Act of 1980. The order also references relevant provisions of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, including the definition of "forest" and "private forest." The impugned notice was issued based on the vesting of lands under the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980.

The court order pertains to the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act of 1975. It states that all private forests in the state shall stand acquired and vest in the state government, free from all encumbrances. However, certain exceptions are made for land held by occupants or tenants lawfully under cultivation, land excluded by the Collector, and land in which the state government and another person are jointly interested. The Collector has the authority to decide any questions related to private forests, and their decision is final subject to appeal to the Tribunal. Section 22A allows for restoration of forest land to owners whose total holding of land is less than 12 hectares.

The court order states that any lawful branches existing before the appointed day will be revived, and the land will be given back to the owner within one month of the order. If the owner has already been paid for the land, they must repay the determined amount to the government within six months. No appeal can be made against the Collector's decision, but the Commissioner or State Government can call for the record of the inquiry or proceedings. Sections of the Forest Act will be repealed, but in respect of the lands restored under section 22A, they will be deemed to have been re-enacted. Section 35 allows the State Government to regulate or prohibit breaking up or clearing land for cultivation in forests or waste-land.

The court order outlines regulations and prohibitions for land use, including cultivation, pasturing of cattle, and clearing of vegetation. These regulations are necessary for purposes such as protection against natural disasters, preservation of soil and water supply, and maintenance of public health. The State Government may construct necessary works at their own expense, but must issue a notice to the owner of the land and consider any objections before proceeding. Any person who contravenes these regulations may face imprisonment or fines. The notice and order must be served on the owner of the land in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court order discusses various cases related to the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975. It highlights that landowners who have been issued notices under Section 35(3) of the Forest Act, 1927 have the opportunity to contend that their land is not a forest and does not vest automatically in the state. The court also discusses the interpretation of the word "issued" in Section 2(f)(iii) of the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975 and concludes that it must be given a broad meaning. The court also considers whether the state can demolish constructions made on forest lands and answers in the negative.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 35(3) of the Forest Act and whether the mere issuance of a notice under this section attracts Sub-Clause (iii) of Clause (f) of Section 2 of the said Act of 1975. The court concludes that service of a notice issued under Section 35(3) of the Forest Act is inherent in the provision and the very purpose of the provision. The court also emphasizes the need for ensuring service to protect the interests of the owner of the forest and prevent damage to or destruction of a forest. The court criticizes a previous decision for missing these finer details and
