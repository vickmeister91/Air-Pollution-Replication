The North Goa District Advocates Association filed a petition challenging the decision of the High Court Administration to shift four Civil and Criminal Courts from the Civil and Criminal Courts building at Panaji to a new building at Patto Plaza, Panaji. The petitioners argued that the existing building was in good condition and that a plot of land had already been allotted for the construction of a new District Court complex that could accommodate 20 courts. The petitioners also pointed out that no steps had been taken to commence the construction of the new complex despite assurances given from time to time.

The court order discusses the construction of a new district court complex in Goa, which was acquired by the government and allotted to civil and criminal courts. However, the building is located near an open garbage dump, which emits foul odors and poses health hazards. The petitioner argues that the decision to shift the courts to this location was arbitrary and unnecessary, as the existing courts were functioning properly and a new court complex could be constructed on an allotted plot. The government argues that the new building is fully air-conditioned and modernized, and that steps have been taken to commence construction of a new court complex in a different location. The court will need to decide whether the decision to shift the courts to this location was arbitrary and whether intervention is necessary.

The court order discusses a petition regarding the decision to shift four courts to a new building in Panaji, Goa. The petitioner argues that the new building is located near a garbage dump and will cause health hazards. The court considers the history of the construction of a court complex on a different site and the steps taken to address the garbage dump issue. The court ultimately upholds the decision to shift the courts to the new building, citing the congested and inconvenient conditions of the current building and the air-conditioned and odor-free environment of the new building.

The North Goa District Advocates' Association wrote letters to the Chief Justice expressing grievances about the delay in constructing a court building on Merces land, despite the foundation stone being laid in 2009. The government of Goa has failed to fulfill its constitutional obligation to construct court buildings and provide basic infrastructure. The Law Secretary of the Government of Goa stated that the construction of the court complex has been entrusted to the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, and consultants have been appointed for the project. However, further delay is expected due to suggestions and recommendations from the Chief Justice. The court proposes to issue appropriate directions to ensure that the new court complex becomes functional within a fixed time.

The court order sets a deadline of January 15, 2018, for the completion of the construction of a new District and Subordinate Courts Complex in North Goa, India. The government is required to submit periodical reports on the progress of construction every three months, and the court will monitor the work to ensure it is completed on time. Any delay in completion will result in a significant financial burden on the public exchequer. The order also discusses a decision to shift four courts to the new building and the opinions of the Principal District Judge on the matter.

The court order discusses the acquisition of office space by the Government of Goa and the subsequent allotment of the space to various entities, including the Civil and Criminal Courts. The order notes that objections were raised by the Advocates' Association and others regarding the shifting of the courts to the new building, but no mention was made of the building's proximity to a garbage dump. The order also mentions that possession of the premises was handed over by the company offering the building, rather than the government.

The court order discusses the history of a decision to move courts to a new building, including meetings and approvals. The petitioners filed a writ petition to stop the move due to concerns about a nearby garbage dump causing health hazards. The court acknowledges the delay in filing the petition and notes that the move is temporary until a new court complex is ready. The court also considers an affidavit from the Goa Pollution Control Board regarding efforts to reduce the odor from the garbage dump.

The court order discusses the issue of odour emanating from a waste dump in Panaji, Goa. The Goa State Pollution Control Board has issued directions to cover the dump to reduce pollution. The court acknowledges that until an alternate facility becomes functional, the current facility cannot be closed as it is the only available option. The court also notes that the facility at Patto Plaza receives more waste than its capacity and causes a nuisance and health hazard to nearby offices and public sector undertakings. The Pollution Control Board has issued directions to the Corporation of City of Panaji regarding the deficiencies at the dumping site.

The court order refers to a pollution control board's inspection report that found a compost heap emitting foul odour and causing pollution. The court directs the board to take necessary steps to minimize inconvenience caused to litigants and lawyers due to the shifting of four courts to a temporary building. The court also orders the government of Goa to complete the construction of a new court complex by January 15, 2018, and submit quarterly reports on the progress made. The petition is rejected with no order as to costs.

The court has ordered the Government of Goa to submit quarterly reports on the progress of the construction of the court complex, along with photographs, and to serve copies of the reports to the petitioners. The Goa State Pollution Control Board is also required to submit quarterly reports on steps taken to reduce/prevent the nuisance caused by the garbage dump, and to serve copies
