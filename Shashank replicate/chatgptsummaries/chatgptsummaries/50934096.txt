The Madras High Court recently passed a court order in a batch of writ petitions filed by M/s. New Fly Ash Bricks Manufacturers Association against the Government of India and Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The petitioners sought a writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to implement the Office Memorandum and notification issued by the first respondent and forbear them from collecting any service charge from the members of the petitioner association in respect of Fly Ash allotment to be used for manufacturing bricks, blocks, and tiles.

The court found that the issue involved in these batch of cases are squarely covered in favor of the petitioners by the decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench and allowed the writ petitions on the same lines.
