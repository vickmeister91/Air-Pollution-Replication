The Delhi High Court recently dismissed three petitions challenging a conditional order issued by the S.D.M. Patel Nagar, New Delhi, under Section 133(1)(b) Cr. P.C. The order required the occupants of shops No. 29, 31 and 33 in New Market, Ramesh Nagar, New Delhi, to cease carrying on the manufacture of plastic or plastic-related products within one month. The petitioners argued that the procedure adopted by the Sdm was illegal and that the provisions of Section 133 Cr. P.C. were meant for removing public, not private, nuisance. However, the court found no substance in the contentions raised by the petitioners and dismissed the petitions.

The case revolved around the interpretation of Section 133(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers a magistrate to issue a conditional order for the removal of a public nuisance. The petitioners argued that the provision was not applicable to private nuisances and that the Sdm had exceeded his jurisdiction by issuing the order. However, the court held that the provision was wide enough to cover both public and private nuisances and that the Sdm had acted within his powers.

The court also rejected the petitioners' contention that the procedure adopted by the Sdm was illegal. The petitioners had argued that the Sdm had not followed the procedure laid down in Section 133 Cr. P.C. for the removal of a public nuisance. However, the court held that the Sdm had followed the procedure correctly and that there was no illegality in the order.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 133(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The provision has often been used by authorities to remove public nuisances such as encroachments, but its applicability to private nuisances has been a matter of debate. The court's decision makes it clear that the provision can be used to remove both public and private nuisances.

The case also highlights the issue of plastic pollution, which has become a major environmental concern in recent years. The court's order requiring the occupants of the shops to cease manufacturing plastic or plastic-related products is a step towards addressing this issue. Plastic pollution has been linked to a range of environmental problems, including the death of marine life and the contamination of water sources.

Overall, the Delhi High Court's decision in this case is a significant one as it clarifies the scope of Section 133(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code and highlights the issue of plastic pollution. The court's order requiring the occupants of the shops to cease manufacturing plastic or plastic-related products is a positive step towards addressing this issue.
