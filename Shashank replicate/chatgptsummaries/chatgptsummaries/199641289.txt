The Allahabad High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by M/S Kirori Lal Cold Storage against the State of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner sought the quashing of an order passed by the U.P. Pollution Control Board, which directed for the closure of the petitioner's unit of cold storage in Jalesar District Etah and the disconnection of electricity and water connections to the unit. The court ordered the Board to issue a show cause notice to the petitioner, provide an opportunity for a hearing, and pass an appropriate order within three weeks. The court also restrained the authorities from disconnecting the electricity and water connections until a fresh order is passed by the Board.

The petitioner, M/S Kirori Lal Cold Storage, had approached the court seeking relief against the order passed by the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The Board had directed for the closure of the petitioner's unit of cold storage in Jalesar District Etah and the disconnection of electricity and water connections to the unit. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without providing an opportunity for a hearing and without considering the relevant facts and circumstances.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the order passed by the Board was prima facie arbitrary and violative of the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the Board had not provided an opportunity for a hearing to the petitioner before passing the order. The court also observed that the Board had not considered the relevant facts and circumstances before passing the order.

The court, therefore, directed the Board to issue a show cause notice to the petitioner, provide an opportunity for a hearing, and pass an appropriate order within three weeks. The court also restrained the authorities from disconnecting the electricity and water connections until a fresh order is passed by the Board.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and provides relief to the petitioner against an arbitrary order passed by the Board. The court's direction to the Board to issue a show cause notice and provide an opportunity for a hearing ensures that the petitioner's right to be heard is protected. The court's restraint on the authorities from disconnecting the electricity and water connections until a fresh order is passed by the Board ensures that the petitioner's business is not adversely affected.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision in the writ petition filed by M/S Kirori Lal Cold Storage against the State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant one. The court's decision upholds the principles of natural justice and provides relief to the petitioner against an arbitrary order passed by the Board. The court's direction to the Board to issue a show cause notice and provide an opportunity for a hearing ensures that the petitioner's right to be heard is protected. The court's restraint on the authorities from disconnecting the electricity and water connections until a fresh order is passed by the Board ensures that the petitioner's business is not adversely affected.
