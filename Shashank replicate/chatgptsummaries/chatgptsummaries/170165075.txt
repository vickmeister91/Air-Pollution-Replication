A recent court order pertains to a truck that was seized in connection with a criminal case. The petitioner, who claims to be the registered owner of the truck, filed an application for releasing the vehicle on Supurdnama, which was dismissed earlier. The petitioner then filed a criminal revision, which was also dismissed. However, the court has now allowed the truck to be released on Supurdnama subject to certain conditions.

The court has imposed several conditions on the petitioner for the release of the truck. Firstly, the petitioner must furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 5,00,000 and supurdnama in the sum of Rs. 15,00,000. This is to ensure that the petitioner will comply with the conditions set by the court and will not abscond with the truck. The petitioner is also not allowed to transfer, sell, alienate or create third party interest in the vehicle without the permission of the trial court. This is to prevent any further complications in the criminal case and to ensure that the truck remains available for the trial.

Furthermore, the court has ordered that the vehicle must be produced as and when required by the trial court during the trial till disposal of the criminal case. This is to ensure that the truck remains available for the trial and that the trial is not delayed due to the unavailability of the vehicle. The court has also made it clear that any violation of the conditions set by the court will result in the cancellation of the Supurdnama and the bank guarantee.

The court's decision to release the truck on Supurdnama is a significant development in the case. Supurdnama is a legal document that allows the release of a seized vehicle to its owner subject to certain conditions. It is a common practice in criminal cases where vehicles are seized as evidence. The release of the truck on Supurdnama means that the petitioner will have access to the vehicle during the trial, which could be crucial for their defense.

However, the conditions set by the court for the release of the truck are stringent and reflect the court's concern about the possibility of the petitioner absconding with the vehicle or using it to influence the trial. The requirement of a bank guarantee and supurdnama in the sum of Rs. 15,00,000 is a significant financial burden on the petitioner. The prohibition on transferring, selling, alienating or creating third party interest in the vehicle without the permission of the trial court is also a significant restriction on the petitioner's rights as the owner of the vehicle.

In conclusion, the court's decision to release the truck on Supurdnama subject to certain conditions is a significant development in the case. The conditions set by the court reflect the court's concern about the possibility of the petitioner absconding with the vehicle or using it to influence the trial. The petitioner must comply with the conditions set by the court, failing which the Supurdnama and the bank guarantee will be cancelled. The release of the truck on Supurdnama means that the petitioner will have access to the vehicle during the trial, which could be crucial for their defense. However, the conditions set by the court are stringent and reflect the court's concern about the possibility of the petitioner absconding with the vehicle or using it to influence the trial.
