The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other related authorities. The petitions involve disputes related to the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the demand notice for Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015.

The first court order lists the details of the petitions and their respective petitioners and respondents. The petitioners include companies involved in the mining and marble industries, as well as individuals. The order also lists the names of the lawyers representing the petitioners and the respondent. However, no specific details about the content of the petitions are provided.

The second court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

The third court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner, one of the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur, has filed a writ petition praying for quashing of the demand notice and further direction to restrain the respondents from recovering NPV amount from the petitioner. The court has been presented with various arguments by the learned Additional Advocate General, including the fact that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and thus, approval was given on 07.02.2000 for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017. The court has also been informed that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been presented with various guidelines and clarifications issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forest, New Delhi, and the relevant portion of the guidelines for preparation of cluster mining proposals. The court has been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief by way of these writ petitions, as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

The fourth court order discusses multiple writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The controversy involves the demand notice for Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The petitioner, along with other mining lease holders, deposited a sum of money as compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining activity. The Forest Department demanded NPV from the Mining Department, which was to be deposited within two years of the notification dated 01.04.2015. The court heard all the petitions together and made a common judgment.

The fifth court order pertains to a group of 136 mining lease holders in a forest area of 281 hectares in India. The mining lease holders were asked to pay a Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of their lease period, but they refused to pay for the entire 281 hectares and also did not segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department. The total common area being used by the mining lease holders will be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court orders involve disputes related to the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the demand notice for Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The petitioners include companies involved in the mining and marble industries, as well as individuals. The court considered various guidelines and clarifications issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forest, New Delhi, and the relevant portion of the guidelines for preparation of cluster mining proposals.
