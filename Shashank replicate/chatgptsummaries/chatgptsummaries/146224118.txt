The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various cases related to mining lease renewals and grant of mining leases in different districts of India. The first court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by Sri P Venkateshwara Rao and Sri Iqbal Baig against the Union of India and others regarding the grant of mining lease in Navalatti Village, Bellary District. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to the historical background of the case. The court ordered that the final order and communication dated 05.12.2008 and 15.01.2009 be quashed and further proceedings be stopped. The court also ordered that the endorsement dated 04.10.2008 be quashed.

In another court order, the court directed the State Government to consider the renewal application filed by the legal heirs of late Krishnamachari, the original grantee, and quashed the recommendation made by the State Government. The order also addressed contentions raised by both parties, including issues of delay in filing, non-joinder of necessary parties, and the legal rights of the grantee's heirs. The court ultimately upheld the decision of the Tribunal to condone the delay in filing the revision petition and allows for the renewal application to be considered.

The third court order discusses a case involving a mining lease renewal application that was not disposed of by the State Government. The court ordered the State Government to consider the application for renewal of the mining lease. The court also examined whether legal representatives have a vested right to seek renewal of the lease and whether a previous order rejecting a request to consider an application was correct. Ultimately, the court finds that the notification calling for applications for mining lease was sought to be quashed, and the application for renewal of the lease was not considered by the original lessee.

In the fourth court order, the court dismissed the revision petition filed by the petitioners seeking relief from a notification issued by the government regarding mining lease renewal. The court found that the petitioners were aware of the notification and had been submitting representations to the authorities to keep their claim alive. The court also examined the Mineral Concession Rules and found that the delay could not be condoned.

The fifth court order discusses a case where the deceased Krishnamachari had approached the Mines Tribunal for renewal of his lease, but the State Government did not consider his application. The court concluded that sufficient cause exists for the delay and condones it. The court also discusses the delay aspect on three fronts and refers to some decisions of the Apex Court which reflect light on this issue.

The sixth court order states that the revision petition filed by respondents 4 and 5 was highly belated and barred by limitation, and therefore, it was liable to be dismissed at the threshold. The court held that the right of the original lessee to seek renewal got abated, and therefore, the State Government was well within its jurisdiction to issue a notification under Rule 59(1) of the MC Rules, notifying the area available for grant of mining lease.

The seventh court order discusses the renewal of mining leases granted for minerals specified in Park A and Part B of the First Schedule to the Act. The court allowed Writ Petition Nos. 21319/2009 and 61038/2009 in part, quashing and dismissing the order dated 05-12-2008 and setting aside the direction issued by the State Government dated 15-01-2009. The court rejected the prayer sought for by the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 61038/2009 for quashing the order dated 04-10-2008 and order dated 18-10-2008, and the claim of the petitioner would be regulated by the outcome of Writ Appeal No. 6087/2009 and Writ Appeal No. 1243/2008.

In conclusion, these court orders deal with various aspects related to mining lease renewals and grant of mining leases. The court has considered issues related to delay in filing, non-joinder of necessary parties, and the legal rights of the grantee's heirs. The court has also examined the Mineral Concession Rules and the interpretation of the expression "sufficient cause" in Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The court has ordered the State Government to consider the renewal application filed by the legal heirs of the original grantee and quashed the recommendation made by the State Government. The court has also quashed the final order and communication dated 05.12.2008 and 15.01.2009 and further proceedings be stopped.
