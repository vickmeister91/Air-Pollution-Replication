The Sabarisa Seva Samajam, a society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975, has been organizing the Ayyappan Vilakku Pooja Festival at Sri Lakshminarayana Temple, Madukkarai, Coimbatore, for several years. The festival involves the use of elephants, which are brought from Kerala for a short duration with the permission of the authorities under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. 

In 2016, the petitioner submitted an application for the festival, which was scheduled to take place on December 31st of that year. However, the application was still pending consideration. The petitioner approached the court seeking a direction to the authorities to grant permission for the festival.

The court directed the third respondent to attain finality to the proceedings within three days from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly.

The case highlights the issue of the use of elephants in festivals and the need for proper regulation and oversight. While the use of elephants in festivals is a long-standing tradition in many parts of India, it has also been the subject of controversy and criticism due to concerns about the welfare of the animals and the safety of the public.

In recent years, there have been several incidents of elephants running amok during festivals, causing damage to property and injuring people. In response, the government has introduced regulations to ensure the safety of the animals and the public.

Under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the use of elephants for performances or exhibitions is prohibited unless the organizer obtains permission from the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state. The permission is granted subject to certain conditions, such as the provision of adequate food, water, and medical care for the animals.

In addition, the Central Zoo Authority has issued guidelines for the care and management of elephants in captivity. The guidelines require that elephants be housed in spacious enclosures with access to water and shade, and that they be provided with a balanced diet and regular medical check-ups.

Despite these regulations, there have been instances of elephants being mistreated and abused during festivals. In some cases, the animals are forced to stand for long hours in the scorching sun without adequate food or water. In other cases, they are subjected to physical abuse by their handlers.

The case of the Ayyappan Vilakku Pooja Festival highlights the need for proper regulation and oversight of the use of elephants in festivals. While the tradition of using elephants in festivals is an important part of Indian culture, it is important to ensure that the animals are treated with respect and dignity and that their welfare is protected.
