The Madras High Court recently heard appeals filed by M/s. Rane TRW Steering System Ltd against the Commissioner of Central Excise and Central Tax, Chennai, regarding the availing of CENVAT credit for garden maintenance services. The Commissioner had issued two show cause notices for the recovery of CENVAT credit, and the adjudicating authority confirmed the demand and imposed a penalty. The Commissioner (Appeals) dismissed the appeals, and the CESTAT confirmed the tax liability but set aside the penalty. The appellant filed appeals before the High Court, arguing that garden maintenance services were necessary input services within the definition of Rule 2 (l) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The Court heard arguments from both parties and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "input service" under the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The court examines the definition of input service before and after an amendment, and considers whether garden maintenance services fall within the definition of input service. The court also refers to previous cases to interpret the terms "in relation to" and "includes" used in the rules. The court ultimately concludes that garden maintenance services do not fall within the definition of input service as they are not directly or indirectly related to the manufacture of final products.

The court order explains the interpretation of the expression "used in relation to the manufacture of final products" in Rule 57A of the Central Excise Rules. The court held that the expression has been used to widen and expand the scope of the term "inputs" to include goods that do not enter into finished goods but are used in the manufacturing process. The court also held that the definition of "input service" is very wide and covers not only services used directly or indirectly in or in relation to the manufacture of final products but also includes various services used in relation to the business of manufacturing the final products. The court further held that all services used in relation to the business of manufacturing the final product are covered under the definition of "input service". The court also considered whether garden maintenance service is an input service falling under the inclusive definition.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "input services" in the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The court cites previous cases, including Maruti Suzuki Ltd. and Millipore India Pvt. Ltd., to support its decision that services related to maintaining factory premises in an eco-friendly manner can be considered input services and qualify for CENVAT credit. The court also distinguishes between obiter dicta and ratio decidendi, stating that only the latter is binding as a precedent.

The court order states that only the ratio decidendi can act as the binding or authoritative precedent, and casual remarks made by the court that are not relevant to the issue at hand have no authoritative value. The court also cites various cases where the maintenance of gardens or landscaping of factories was considered an essential part of the manufacturing process and therefore eligible for Cenvat credit. The court also notes that activities must have a nexus with the business of the assessee to qualify as input services.

The court order pertains to a case where Arcolab Ltd. had sought a refund of credit on various services, which was rejected by the Commissioner of Appeals. The appellant then approached CESTAT, Bangalore, seeking reversal of the decision. The appellant argued that all the input services on which refund had been claimed had been used in or in relation to the manufacture of goods. The appellant relied on various decisions to support their claim. The court order lists the nature of services and the submissions made by the appellant, along with the decisions that support their claim.

The court order discusses various cases related to the eligibility of input services for Cenvat credit. The services include professional fees, recruitment expenses, rent charges, software development, stock exchange charges, training charges, traveling expenses, and bio study charges. The court also refers to various judgments and holds that input services used in relation to modernization, renovation, or repairs of a factory, advertisement or sales promotion, security, legal services, etc., are included in the inclusive definition of input services. The court emphasizes that the input services may not be directly related to the manufacture of the final product, but they may be integrally connected and that there should be a nexus with manufacture.

The court order states that garden maintenance service is considered an input service as it is a pollution control requirement and improves the aesthetics and overall atmosphere, making it an expenditure in or in relation to manufacture. The court cites a previous judgment in favor of the assessee and declares that the Tribunal was not right in denying input service credit availed on garden maintenance service. The Civil Miscellaneous Appeals are allowed, and the connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.

In conclusion, the court order discusses various cases related to the eligibility of input services for Cenvat credit. The court emphasizes that the input services may not be directly related to the manufacture of the final product, but they may be integrally connected and that there should be a nexus with manufacture. The court also distinguishes between obiter dicta and ratio decidendi, stating that only the latter is binding as a precedent. The court ultimately concludes that garden maintenance services do not fall within the definition of input service as they are not directly or indirectly related to the manufacture of final products. However, the court also states that garden maintenance service is considered an input service as it is a pollution
