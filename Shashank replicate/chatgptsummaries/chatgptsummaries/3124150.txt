The State of Maharashtra is appealing a court order from 19 March 2015 that granted Vinod Jagannath Chaudhari's request for the cellular services provider to preserve records of two cellular phones. The State argues that the application was vague and ambiguous and that the order was passed without justifiable reasons. The defense argues that the records will reveal conversations between the complainant and the Investigating Officer that will support Chaudhari's case. The defense also cites a previous case to support their argument that the records should be preserved if they will eventually bring the truth before the court.

The court order pertains to an application (Exhibit-4) requesting the preservation and production of CDR and SDR records along with tower location. The court has directed the preservation of these records but has not yet considered the prayer for their production. The accused cannot be compelled to disclose their defense at a stage where it is not right to do so. The court has no reason to disagree with the conclusions of the learned Additional Sessions Judge since the application is rightly allowed. The order is restricted only to the preservation of the records, and if the accused desires to seek their production, they shall have to move a separate application for the same.

The case in question involves Vinod Jagannath Chaudhari, who has been accused of a crime and is currently awaiting trial. Chaudhari has requested that the cellular services provider preserve records of two cellular phones, which he claims will support his case. The State of Maharashtra is appealing the court order that granted Chaudhari's request, arguing that the application was vague and ambiguous and that the order was passed without justifiable reasons.

The defense, on the other hand, argues that the records will reveal conversations between the complainant and the Investigating Officer that will support Chaudhari's case. They also cite a previous case to support their argument that the records should be preserved if they will eventually bring the truth before the court.

The preservation of the records is an important step in ensuring that justice is served in this case. The records may contain crucial evidence that could help to prove Chaudhari's innocence or guilt. It is important that the records are preserved so that they can be used in court if necessary.

The State of Maharashtra's argument that the application was vague and ambiguous is not convincing. The court order clearly states that the preservation of the records is necessary for the case. The defense's argument that the records will reveal conversations between the complainant and the Investigating Officer that will support Chaudhari's case is also compelling. If the records do contain such conversations, they could be crucial in proving Chaudhari's innocence.

The court's decision to restrict the order to the preservation of the records is also reasonable. The accused cannot be compelled to disclose their defense at a stage where it is not right to do so. If the accused desires to seek the production of the records, they shall have to move a separate application for the same.

In conclusion, the court order granting Vinod Jagannath Chaudhari's request for the cellular services provider to preserve records of two cellular phones is an important step in ensuring that justice is served in this case.
