The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Smt. Sheela Devi against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. 

The court issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

In another court order, the State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them for contamination. The report reveals that the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work, but the clean water reservoir is normal. The state was directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The State was directed to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the State fails to submit the scheme. The District Collector, Ganga Nagar was directed to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date. The State was directed to remove all encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through the municipal areas.

The National Green Tribunal issued an order in October 2015 regarding the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and a committee was formed to monitor the removal of encroachments. The State was directed to remove all encroachments within one month, and a compliance report was to be filed by January 2016. The State was also directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. However, the compliance report filed by the State did not disclose the number of encroachers who obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The Tribunal ordered the State to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, and to file a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments.

In another court order, the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers was discussed. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggested that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief since the State Authorities are taking action pursuant to the directions given by the NGT. The court also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order states that the original applicant's petition is barred by limitation and the issue has not been decided yet. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order passed by the subordinate court or tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The jurisdiction vested with the tribunal is wide and covers not only damage already caused but also matters proposed to prevent any damage. The court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction in this matter and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT after December 31, 2016.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the measures that the State of Rajasthan needs to take to prevent further pollution. The court has issued several directions to the state, including the removal of inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal, providing safe drinking water to affected villages, constructing waste water drains, and removing encroachments along the distributories and canal. The court has also imposed damages or compensation on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directed citizens to be made aware of this direction. The State has been directed to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court has also discussed the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers.
