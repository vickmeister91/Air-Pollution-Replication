In a recent order, the Allahabad High Court has directed the respondent to consider and decide the application for consent to run a small flour mill, oil speller, dhan mill, and paleshar machine in accordance with Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The order was passed on September 30, 2019, after the petitioner submitted the necessary application and fee for the same.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is an important legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in the country. Section 21 of the Act deals with the procedure for obtaining consent to establish and operate any industrial plant or process that is likely to emit air pollutants. The section requires the owner or operator of such a plant or process to submit an application for consent to the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) or Pollution Control Committee (PCC) of the Union Territory concerned.

In the present case, the petitioner had applied for consent to run a small flour mill, oil speller, dhan mill, and paleshar machine, which are all industrial processes that are likely to emit air pollutants. The respondent, however, had not considered the application despite the petitioner submitting the necessary application and fee. This led the petitioner to approach the Allahabad High Court seeking a direction to the respondent to consider and decide the application in accordance with the law.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the respondent to consider and decide the application in accordance with Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Court also made it clear that the decision should be taken in accordance with the law and after giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The order of the Allahabad High Court is significant as it upholds the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the need to comply with its provisions. The Act is a crucial tool in the fight against air pollution, which is a major environmental and public health concern in India. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and lays down the standards for emissions from various sources.

The Act also provides for the establishment of State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to implement its provisions. These bodies are responsible for granting consent to establish and operate industrial plants and processes that are likely to emit air pollutants. They are also responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the standards laid down under the Act.

The Allahabad High Court's order is a reminder to all stakeholders, including the SPCBs and PCCs, of the importance of complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. It is also a reminder to industrial operators to obtain the necessary consent before establishing and operating any plant or process that is likely to emit air pollutants.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's order is a welcome step in the fight against air pollution in India. It reinforces the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the need to comply with its provisions. It also highlights the role of the SPCBs and PCCs in implementing the Act and ensuring compliance with its standards.
