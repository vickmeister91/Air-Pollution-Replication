The case in question pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking the renewal of a mining lease. The lease was originally granted for a period of five years, and the petitioner had applied for renewal before the expiry date. However, the District Magistrate did not pass any order on the renewal application as a No Objection Certificate (NOC) was required from the Forest Department.

The petitioner argued that a certificate submitted at the time of granting the lease should be sufficient for renewal. However, the court ruled that a fresh certificate was required as per Rule 6A and the Forest Conservation Act. The court held that the purpose of obtaining an NOC from the Forest Department was to ensure that the mining activity did not cause any damage to the forest area and its wildlife. Therefore, a fresh certificate was necessary to assess the impact of the mining activity on the forest area.

The court also noted that the Forest Conservation Act required the renewal of a mining lease to be subject to the same conditions as the original lease. Therefore, the petitioner could not argue that the NOC submitted at the time of granting the lease should be sufficient for renewal.

The court directed the District Magistrate to obtain a fresh certificate from the Forest Department and decide on the renewal application within two months. The court also noted that if the Forest Department failed to issue the NOC within the stipulated time, the District Magistrate could proceed to decide on the renewal application based on the available material.

In conclusion, the court held that a fresh NOC from the Forest Department was necessary for the renewal of a mining lease as per Rule 6A and the Forest Conservation Act. The court directed the District Magistrate to obtain a fresh certificate and decide on the renewal application within two months. This case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary clearances and certificates before undertaking any activity that may have an impact on the environment.
