The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by nine petitioners seeking a writ of prohibition against the Commissioner of Survey, Settlement and Land Records and the Director of Settlement, Survey and Land-Records from proceeding with a suo motu revision taken up at the instance of the Divisional Forest Officer. The land in question was granted on yearly leases to the petitioners by the Muttadar in the year 1960, and after the Mutt was abolished and taken over by the government, the Settlement Officer initiated an enquiry for the grant of ryotwari pattas. The District Forest Officer brought to the notice of the Director of Settlements that the lands were adjacent to the Dummukonda Reserve Forest and had thick forest growth consisting of various timber yielding trees, and that the lands were never cultivated and had a gradient of more than 10%, which cannot be granted on patta in view of the prohibition contained in S.7 of Regulation. The Commissioner visited the village and inspected the lands in question and passed an order suspending the order of the Settlement Officer pending the result of suo motu enquiry being taken up. The petitioners filed a writ petition to suspend the order of the Commissioner.

The court order states that even if an order in appeal has become final, authorities can still exercise revisionary powers if the order is patently illegal or otherwise vitiated. The revisionary power can be used to correct any order passed by a subordinate authority, be it administrative or judicial. The only condition is that the party affected should be given an opportunity to make a representation. In the case at hand, the Forest Authorities were not party to the proceedings before the Settlement Officer, but after an inspection, it was found that the lands in question had thick forest growth and were not agricultural lands. Therefore, the Commissioner of Survey, Settlements and Land Records has the power and jurisdiction to proceed with a suo motu enquiry. The petitioners and concerned authorities will be given an opportunity to produce evidence, and the Bank guarantee furnished by the petitioners should be kept alive until the disposal of the proceedings.

The court has ordered the petitioners to renew and maintain a bank guarantee of Rs. 21 lakhs until the proceedings before the Commissioner of Survey, Settlements and Land Records are completed. If the pattas granted to the petitioners are ultimately set aside by the Commissioner, the government can enforce the bank guarantee.
