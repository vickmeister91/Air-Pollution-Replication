In a recent case, the court denied anticipatory bail to a petitioner who was accused of killing a wild elephant and removing its tusk. The petitioner was charged under sections 27(1)(e) of the Kerala Forest Act and section 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court directed the petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate concerned and seek regular bail within two weeks from the date of the order. The court also ordered that the bail application should be considered and disposed of preferably on the same date on which it is filed.

The case involved the killing of a wild elephant and the removal of its tusk, which is a serious offense under the law. The petitioner had sought anticipatory bail to avoid arrest and prosecution. However, the court found that the petitioner's involvement in the crime was prima facie established and that he was not entitled to anticipatory bail.

The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail was based on several factors. First, the court found that the petitioner's involvement in the crime was established by the evidence on record. Second, the court noted that the offense was serious in nature and that the petitioner's release on bail could hamper the investigation. Third, the court found that the petitioner was not entitled to anticipatory bail as he had not made out a strong case for the same.

The court directed the petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate concerned and seek regular bail within two weeks from the date of the order. The court also ordered that the bail application should be considered and disposed of preferably on the same date on which it is filed. This was done to ensure that the petitioner's right to seek bail was not unduly delayed or denied.

The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail and direct the petitioner to surrender and seek regular bail is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. The court has ensured that the petitioner's right to seek bail is not unduly curtailed, while at the same time ensuring that the investigation is not hampered and that the accused is brought to justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the petitioner and direct him to surrender and seek regular bail within two weeks is a just and fair decision. The court has taken into account the seriousness of the offense, the evidence on record, and the petitioner's right to seek bail. The court's order that the bail application should be considered and disposed of preferably on the same date on which it is filed is a welcome step towards ensuring that justice is not delayed or denied.
