The court order pertains to a dispute over compensation for land acquired by the government for the development of Benaulim Beach in Salcete Taluka. The landowner had sought a reference to be made under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, claiming enhancement at the rate of Rs. 250/- per sq. m. The court found that the learned Additional District Judge had erred in his approach to fixing compensation and that the sale deeds produced by the landowner were not reliable guides for determining market value. The court also noted that an area of 15000 sq.m. was practically of no use for construction purposes due to restrictions on development within 200 m. of the high tide line.

The court order discusses the assessment of market value for acquired land and the use of previous judgments or awards as a basis for determining compensation. The court also considers the impact of severance on remaining property and awards compensation for the loss of access to the land. The judgment modifies the compensation awarded to the applicant for the acquired land and awards additional compensation for the remaining land that has been severed.
