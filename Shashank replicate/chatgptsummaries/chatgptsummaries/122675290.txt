The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Thakur Randhir Singh against the State of J&K and others. The petitioner seeks the quashing of an order directing him to vacate a government accommodation and the issuance of a mandamus to regularize/allot the same in his favor. The petitioner argues that the order is illegal, arbitrary, and violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The court has heard the arguments of both parties and will make a decision on the matter.

The court order states that it is unfortunate that many people continue to stay in residential accommodations provided by the government even though they are no longer entitled to them. The order directs the unauthorized occupants to vacate the government accommodation by a certain date failing which the government will take necessary action to forcibly evict them. The order also discusses the principle of audi alteram partem, which requires that no one should be condemned unheard, but in cases where the facts are admitted or indisputable, the "useless formality theory" can be applied. The court order cites a previous judgment that found that allottees of government accommodation must vacate the premises within 30 days after they cease to hold the official status/position for which the accommodation was allotted to them. The order also notes that the petitioner in this case has been in unauthorized occupation of government accommodation since 1993 and has no reasonable cause to continue occupying it.

The court order states that former Ministers/Legislators residing in Srinagar and Jammu may be provided with alternate accommodation for a limited period of time. The court trusts that the government is in the process of evicting all unauthorized occupants and reminds them of their duty to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court. The court also concludes that an unauthorized occupant of government accommodation has no indefeasible right to be heard before eviction and that the petitioner in this case has failed to show any valid reason to retain the accommodation. The writ petition is dismissed.
