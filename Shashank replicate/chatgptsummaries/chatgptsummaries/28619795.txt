M/s Crown Milk Specialities Pvt. Ltd. has been granted relief from the consequences of an impugned order by the court. The company had shifted to a high-speed boiler that is functioning well and giving satisfactory results. However, the Pollution Control Board has the right to initiate fresh action against the petitioner if any violation is found under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner has been given a deadline of 1st July, 2018, to finally shift to a CNG boiler.

The court order has been issued in response to a petition filed by M/s Crown Milk Specialities Pvt. Ltd. The company had challenged an order passed by the Pollution Control Board, which had directed the petitioner to stop using its existing boiler and shift to a CNG boiler. The petitioner had argued that the order was arbitrary and unreasonable, and that it would cause financial hardship to the company.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the impugned order was passed on the basis of a report submitted by the State Pollution Control Board, which had found that the petitioner was using a boiler that was causing air pollution. The court noted that the petitioner had not denied the findings of the report, and had instead submitted that it had already taken steps to address the issue by shifting to a high-speed boiler.

The court further observed that the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, empowers the Pollution Control Board to take action against any person or company that causes air pollution. The court noted that the impugned order was passed in exercise of this power, and that the Pollution Control Board had acted within its jurisdiction.

However, the court also noted that the petitioner had already shifted to a high-speed boiler that was functioning well and giving satisfactory results. The court observed that the petitioner had taken steps to address the issue of air pollution, and that it would not be fair to impose further restrictions on the company.

The court, therefore, allowed the petition and granted relief to the petitioner. The court directed that the company would be liberated from the consequences of the impugned order. However, the court also made it clear that if the Pollution Control Board finds any violation under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, it would be at liberty to initiate fresh action against the petitioner.

The court also directed the petitioner to finally shift to a CNG boiler within a period of 3 months i.e by 1st July, 2018. The court observed that the petitioner had already taken steps to address the issue of air pollution, and that it would not be fair to impose further restrictions on the company. However, the court also noted that the petitioner had to comply with the law and shift to a CNG boiler, which would be more environment-friendly.

In conclusion, the court order has granted relief to M/s Crown Milk Specialities Pvt. Ltd. from the consequences of an impugned order passed by the Pollution Control Board. The company has been allowed to continue using its high-speed boiler, but has been directed to shift to a CNG boiler within a period of 3 months. The court has made it clear that if any violation is found under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, the Pollution Control Board would be at liberty to initiate fresh action against the petitioner.
