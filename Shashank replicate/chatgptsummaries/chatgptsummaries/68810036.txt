In a criminal case, the petitioner challenged an order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate. The petitioner had submitted an application to summon the Postman concerned with the record of the Post Office to prove that the notice issued by the complainant was never served upon the accused. However, the trial court rejected the application.

The petitioner then approached the High Court, which found that the notice was sent to a vague address and the precise address of the petitioner was not indicated. The court allowed the petitioner's application to summon the Postman and the record of the Post Office for the purpose of bringing these facts on record.

The High Court quashed and set aside the impugned order. The court held that the trial court had erred in rejecting the petitioner's application to summon the Postman and the record of the Post Office. The court observed that the purpose of summoning the Postman and the record of the Post Office was to bring on record the fact that the notice was not served upon the accused.

The court further held that the trial court had failed to appreciate the importance of the evidence sought to be adduced by the petitioner. The court noted that the evidence sought to be adduced was crucial to the case and could have a bearing on the outcome of the trial.

The court also observed that the trial court had not given any reasons for rejecting the petitioner's application. The court held that the trial court was duty-bound to give reasons for its decision, failing which the decision would be liable to be set aside.

In conclusion, the High Court allowed the petitioner's application to summon the Postman and the record of the Post Office. The court quashed and set aside the impugned order passed by the trial court. The court held that the trial court had erred in rejecting the petitioner's application and had failed to appreciate the importance of the evidence sought to be adduced. The court also held that the trial court was duty-bound to give reasons for its decision.
