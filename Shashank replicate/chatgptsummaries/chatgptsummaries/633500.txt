The Sri Balaji Park Residents Welfare Association filed a writ petition against the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) for dividing a vacant site reserved for community purposes into small plots and selling them in public auction. The association argued that this action was illegal and arbitrary and requested that the site be reserved for public purposes such as a community center or park. The VUDA argued that the land was lying vacant for a long time and that it had the authority to deal with it in any manner it likes. The court considered whether the VUDA was within its jurisdiction in putting the land in question in public auction.

The court order states that when permission for development is obtained under a certain act, it cannot be deemed unlawful if permission for the same development is not obtained under another law. The court also refers to the Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act and the Layout Rules, which require owners to set aside land for public purposes such as parks and playgrounds. The court holds that the land in question, which was designated as a community center and park, cannot be used for any other purpose and that the action taken by the respondent-Corporation in leasing the land to a private party is ultra vires and a nullity. The court cites previous decisions to support its ruling and emphasizes the importance of public parks and open spaces for maintaining ecological balance and providing recreational activities.

The court order states that the government cannot fail to carry out promises made to citizens, nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to citizens. The court rejected the argument of executive necessity and the doctrine of administrative inconvenience. The court directed the dismantling and demolition of certain structures and the restoration of a park to its original shape. The court also held that the municipality is a public trustee in respect of parks and has a duty to maintain and develop them. The court declared the action of dividing a vacant site into small plots and selling them in a public auction as illegal and contrary to statutory provisions and public policy. The court directed the respondent-authority to maintain the land in question for the purpose for which it was provided for in the Master Plan. Those who had been allotted plots were directed to be allotted land at some other place meant for residential purpose or refunded with interest.
