The court order in question pertains to a civil application filed by Vishal Textile Mills seeking to vacate or modify an order of closure passed by the court due to the unit operating without obtaining consent under section 9 of the Water Act and without treatment facilities. The unit continued to operate despite the order and processed goods worth Rs. 36,00,000/-. 

The court, upon hearing the case, accepted the unconditional apology tendered by the unit and gave it time to pay Rs. 3,61,000/- for remedial measures and betterment of the environment. The unit also expressed its willingness to file an undertaking that it will not carry on any manufacturing activity as a textile unit and will approach the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for appropriate consent for any other manufacturing activity. 

The court disposed of the civil application and directed the unit to pay costs to the GPCB and the State Government. This order serves as a reminder to all industries that they must comply with environmental regulations and obtain necessary consents before operating. Failure to do so can result in legal action and financial penalties. 

It is important to note that the court's decision to accept the unit's apology and allow it to continue operating under certain conditions is not a blanket approval for other industries to flout environmental regulations. Each case will be evaluated on its own merits, and the severity of the violation will be taken into account when determining the appropriate course of action. 

In conclusion, this court order highlights the importance of environmental compliance and the consequences of non-compliance. Industries must take responsibility for their actions and ensure that they operate in a manner that is sustainable and does not harm the environment. The court's decision to allow the unit to continue operating under certain conditions serves as a reminder that there is always an opportunity to make amends and take corrective action, but it is important to do so in a timely and responsible manner.
