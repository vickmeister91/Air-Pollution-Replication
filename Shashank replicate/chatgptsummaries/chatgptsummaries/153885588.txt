The Kerala High Court recently passed a court order in a writ petition filed by M/S Muthoot Finance Ltd against the District Geologist and the State of Kerala. The petitioner had applied for a mining permit and transit passes to remove earth from their land for constructing an office building. However, their application was rejected by the District Geologist, citing the need for an environmental clearance certificate.

The court found that the petitioner was exempt from obtaining an environmental clearance certificate as they had already obtained a building permit for constructing the office building. However, they needed a mining permit for excavation. The court directed the District Geologist to consider and pass orders on the petitioner's application within two weeks and to visit the premises after excavation to issue necessary transit passes.

The court order also stated that the petitioner can excavate earth and apply for a transit pass to transport it from their premises. The first respondent, i.e., the District Geologist, must visit the petitioner's premises and issue the transit pass within three weeks of receiving the application. The court also clarified that the first respondent cannot insist on an environmental clearance certificate for the construction mentioned in the building permit when considering the mining permit and transit pass applications.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal requirements for obtaining a mining permit and transit passes in Kerala. It also highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that government officials do not exceed their authority while processing applications.

The court's decision to exempt the petitioner from obtaining an environmental clearance certificate is based on the fact that they had already obtained a building permit for constructing the office building. This exemption is in line with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, which exempts certain types of construction projects from obtaining environmental clearance certificates.

However, the court's decision to require a mining permit for excavation is based on the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which requires anyone engaging in mining activities to obtain a mining lease or permit.

The court's direction to the District Geologist to visit the petitioner's premises after excavation and issue necessary transit passes is aimed at ensuring that the petitioner is not unduly delayed in their construction activities. This direction is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require government officials to act fairly and impartially while processing applications.

Overall, the court order is a welcome development for the petitioner and other individuals and companies engaged in construction activities in Kerala. It provides clarity on the legal requirements for obtaining mining permits and transit passes and ensures that government officials follow due process while processing applications.
