In 2011, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark order pertaining to allegations of illegal mining in the Bellary district of Karnataka. The court ordered a ban on mining in the district and constituted a Joint Team to determine the boundaries of mining leases. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) submitted a report recommending the categorization of mining leases into three categories based on the extent of illegalities found. The court also ordered the recovery of illegal wealth accumulated through illegal mining and related activities. The order includes several other directions and recommendations related to the mining operations in the state.

The court order, as modified by CEC's report, sets guidelines for iron ore mining in various districts in Karnataka. It includes a ceiling on total production, guidelines for preparation of R&R plans, restrictions on exports, and a system of e-auction for sale of iron ore. The Monitoring Committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with conditions and provisions, and penalties are imposed for illegal mining. The order also recommends cancellation of certain mining leases and transparent bidding for allotment of cancelled leases. The order allows M/s. MML to operate its mining leases or enter into agreements for mining operations and supply of iron ore through a transparent process. A Special Purpose Vehicle is to be created for implementing the order.

The court order requires a transparent process for mining based on market value without hidden subsidies. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be set up for the purpose of taking various ameliorative and mitigative measures in certain districts. The additional resources mobilized by the cancelled mining leases and penalties will be transferred to the SPV for socio-economic development, infrastructure development, conservation, and protection of forests. The Monitoring Committee will sell confiscated iron ore and may sell low grade/sub grade iron ore to certain industries. The court also sets out detailed guidelines for reclamation and rehabilitation plans for each mining lease. The permissible annual production for each lease will be based on mineral reserves, available land, transport facilities, and overall ceiling on annual production. The stabilization of existing overburden/waste dumps and sub grade iron ore dumps will also be addressed.

The court order outlines various measures to be taken for soil and moisture conservation in mining operations, including dump design and protective measures. The design will vary from mine to mine and within the mine from dump to dump. The ultimate objective is to ensure stability and prevent erosion. The order also includes provisions for compensatory payments for illegal mining activities and guarantee money for the implementation of the R&R plan. The monitoring mechanism will assess the successful implementation of the various provisions of the R&R plan. The order also lays down conditions for the reopening of 18 category 'A' mines subject to compliance with statutory requirements and the satisfaction of the Monitoring Committee.

The court order pertains to the resumption of mining operations in Category A and B mines in Bellary, Chitradurga, and Tumkur. The CEC is directed to retain amounts covering illegal mining pits, illegal overburden dumps, and roads and pay the balance amount to the concerned leaseholder. The R&R plans for Category B mines are to be prepared as early as possible, and leaseholders must pay the deficit if the money held in their account is not sufficient to cover the three heads. The court also deals with investigations into alleged criminal offenses by lessees and the sale of existing stock of iron ore. The central issues pertain to objections raised by leaseholders in Category C, challenging the survey carried out by the Joint Team constituted by the court.

The court order discusses various challenges to a survey and categorization of leases in relation to mining operations. The credibility of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) is questioned, but the court finds the allegations unfounded. The court also considers the statutory schemes of various acts and argues that resorting to the powers of the court would be unnecessary when a statutory scheme is in place. The issues are discussed in a sequential order.

The court order states that questions about the credibility of the CEC are unfounded and that the body has been performing tasks assigned by the court. The court has the power to issue directions or orders for the enforcement of fundamental rights, and in this case, the issue is the mass destruction of forest wealth due to illegal mining. The leaseholders argue that the recommendations made by the CEC are beyond the statutory scheme, while the Amicus Curiae argues that the recommendations are supplemental to existing provisions. The court must ensure that its orders or directions do not conflict with any statute, but if the statute does not forbid a particular course of action, the court can issue appropriate directions. The court must enforce fundamental rights, and there can be no limitations on its power in such cases.

The court order states that the Supreme Court has the power to issue any direction, order, or writ, including a writ in the nature of any high prerogative writ, to enforce fundamental rights in the widest possible terms. The Constitution-makers intended to give the Supreme Court ample power to issue whatever direction, order, or writ may be appropriate in a given case for the enforcement of a fundamental right. The court is not restricted to any particular procedure in exercising its power to issue an appropriate direction, order, or writ. The court may adopt any procedure it thinks fit for the purpose of securing the end for which the power is conferred. The court may appoint commissions for the collection of basic facts to enable it to adjudicate issues concerning the violation of fundamental rights.
