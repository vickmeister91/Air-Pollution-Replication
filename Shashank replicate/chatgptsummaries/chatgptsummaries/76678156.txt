The court order pertains to five different cases related to electricity usage and billing disputes. In the first case, Shanti Lal Malhotra filed a case against North Delhi Power Limited claiming that he was the owner of a property and had requested the defendant to grant him a 2 kW single phase connection, but the defendant had failed to do so. The defendant argued that the existing connection was for an industrial category and was installed in an unauthorized area. The court ruled in favor of Malhotra and directed the defendant to install the 2 kW single phase connection in Malhotra's name and declared a bill raised against Malhotra as null and void.

In the second case, an ad-hoc license was revoked, and a higher tariff for electricity usage for industrial activity was charged. The plaintiff's outstanding dues were revised and must be cleared before any new connection or change of category can be granted. The plaintiff argued their case and presented evidence, while the defendant presented their own evidence. The court heard both sides and made issue-wise findings.

The third case pertains to a dispute over a bill raised by the defendant for electricity usage. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the bill was illegal and not payable, claiming that the premises in question were previously occupied by a tenant and any outstanding dues should be recovered from the tenant, not the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the demand was not time-barred and could be raised at any time under the term "Escape Fund." The court found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim and ruled in favor of the defendant.

In the fourth case, the court order states that the Electricity Board has the right to demand payment for charges and can discontinue or cut off the supply if the consumer neglects to pay. The Board can also make a supplementary demand for escaped billing, which is not considered a deficiency of service. The court found no illegality in the bill raised by the defendant against the plaintiff and no decree of declaration can be passed in favor of the plaintiff. The court also noted that the present suit is a billing dispute and falls under Section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003.

In the fifth case, the court order states that the defendant's bill, raised in compliance with an order from the Hon'ble Apex Court, falls under Section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003, and therefore the plaintiff's suit is not maintainable. The court also rules that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief of mandatory and permanent injunction as sought, as no suit for seeking injunction is maintainable before the civil court. The suit of the plaintiff is dismissed.

In summary, these court orders deal with various disputes related to electricity usage and billing. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff in one case, while in the other cases, the court ruled in favor of the defendant. The court emphasized the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims and noted that billing disputes fall under Section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The court also clarified that no suit for seeking injunction is maintainable before the civil court.
