Belmaks Metal Works had filed a writ petition requesting a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash a dated order passed by the respondent and to grant 'Air Consent Order' and 'Water Consent Order' to operate an Electroplating Plant. The respondent had previously granted a No Objection Certificate for the establishment of the industry without an electroplating plant. However, the petitioner emphasized the necessity of the electroplating plant in their manufacturing process and requested a No Objection Certificate for setting up the electroplating plant in their industry. The respondent granted the certificate, but without the electroplating unit. The petitioner made several representations to the respondent requesting permission to run the electroplating plant, but the respondent rejected the request.

The petitioner had argued that the electroplating plant was necessary for their manufacturing process and that they had already invested a significant amount of money in setting up the plant. The petitioner also argued that the respondent had granted similar permissions to other industries in the area and that they were being discriminated against.

The court, after hearing both parties, ordered the respondent to decide on the petitioner's representations at an early date. The court also encouraged a positive approach towards business and industry to promote rapid industrialization in the country. The court emphasized that the government should take a proactive approach towards promoting industries and businesses in the country.

The court noted that the petitioner had already invested a significant amount of money in setting up the electroplating plant and that the respondent's refusal to grant permission to run the plant was causing financial losses to the petitioner. The court also noted that the respondent had granted similar permissions to other industries in the area and that the petitioner was being discriminated against.

The court emphasized that the government should take a positive approach towards promoting industries and businesses in the country. The court noted that the rapid industrialization of the country was necessary for its economic growth and development. The court also noted that the government should take steps to ensure that industries and businesses were not discriminated against and that they were given equal opportunities to grow and prosper.

The court, therefore, ordered the respondent to decide on the petitioner's representations at an early date and to grant the necessary permissions to run the electroplating plant. The court also emphasized that the government should take steps to promote industries and businesses in the country and to ensure that they were not discriminated against.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of Belmaks Metal Works was a positive step towards promoting industries and businesses in the country. The court's emphasis on a positive approach towards business and industry and its encouragement of rapid industrialization in the country is a welcome move. The court's order also highlights the need for the government to take a proactive approach towards promoting industries and businesses in the country and to ensure that they are not discriminated against.
