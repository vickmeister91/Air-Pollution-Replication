The court has issued several orders related to the use of plastic bags and packaging materials in India. One of the orders pertains to a petition filed by 11 plastic bag traders seeking to quash a notification banning the manufacture, transport, store, sale, import, etc. of non-woven polypropylene bags. The petitioners argued that such carry bags with thickness of 300 to 1200 microns are not single-use disposable products and hence not covered by the notification. The court heard arguments from both sides and found that the challenge to the notification had already been made in various writ petitions. The Division Bench at Bombay had admitted the writ petition for final hearing but refused to stay the notification dated 23.03.2018. The court directed the state government to consider any representations made by the petitioners seeking modification of the notification and communicate its decision to them by 5th May 2018. The court did not grant interim relief as prayed for.

Another court order states that for a period of three months from March 23, 2018, no coercive action shall be taken against individual citizens for the use of restricted/regulated/prohibited items covered by the impugned notification dated March 23, 2018, as amended by the notification dated April 11, 2018. The court rejects the prayers made in the petitions for grant of interim relief and directs the State Government to act upon the operative part of this order. The petitions shall be listed on June 8, 2018, for fixing a peremptory date for final hearing. The petitioners have approached the court belatedly and seek an order which has final or irreversible effect as an interim order. The court hears the arguments and the contentions made by the petitioners and their counsel.

The court order also discusses a ban on plastic bags and packaging materials that are less than 50 microns in thickness. The court is considering whether this ban results in discrimination and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The State Government argues that the ban is necessary to eliminate non-biodegradable plastic and is in the interest of the general public. The court also considers the jurisdiction of the State Legislature and the Central Legislation in this matter. The Pollution Control Board argues that the overriding effect of Article 253 must be examined to protect the environment and the rights of transgenders.

In another court order, a petition challenging a notification by the State Government banning non-biodegradable plastic bags is discussed. The court notes that the ban is in the public interest and that the petitioners have not challenged the exercise of powers by the State Government. The court also expresses displeasure at the State Government's failure to file a responsible affidavit in the matter. The court rejects the interim prayer and lists the writ petition for admission on 26.11.2018.

Overall, the court orders reflect the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding the use of plastic bags and packaging materials in India. While some petitioners argue that the bans are discriminatory or unnecessary, the court has generally upheld the government's authority to regulate the use of these materials in the interest of public health and the environment. However, the court has also expressed concern about the government's failure to file responsible affidavits and to consider the views of affected parties in implementing these bans. As the legal challenges continue, it remains to be seen how the government will balance the need for environmental protection with the concerns of affected industries and individuals.
