The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant is being prosecuted for embezzlement while working as a postmaster. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for production of documents allegedly forged or signed by him to show his innocence. However, the trial court rejected the application on the ground of restriction imposed under Section 91(3)(b) of Cr.P.C.

The High Court, upon hearing the appeal, set aside the order of the trial court and directed the applicant to renew his prayer by way of an appropriate application under Section 92 of Cr.P.C. before the trial court. The court held that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. on the ground of restriction imposed under Section 91(3)(b) of Cr.P.C. The High Court observed that the restriction under Section 91(3)(b) of Cr.P.C. applies only to a person who is not a party to the proceedings and not to the accused himself.

The High Court further held that the documents sought by the applicant were relevant to the case and could not be denied to him. The court noted that the documents were necessary for the applicant to establish his innocence and that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application. The High Court, therefore, directed the applicant to renew his prayer by way of an appropriate application under Section 92 of Cr.P.C. before the trial court.

The court also directed the applicant to appear before the trial court on the next date of hearing with a certified copy of the order. The court emphasized that the applicant must comply with the directions of the court and that failure to do so would result in appropriate action being taken against him.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant is being prosecuted for embezzlement while working as a postmaster. The High Court set aside the order of the trial court and directed the applicant to renew his prayer by way of an appropriate application under Section 92 of Cr.P.C. before the trial court. The court also directed the applicant to appear before the trial court on the next date of hearing with a certified copy of the order. The court emphasized that the applicant must comply with the directions of the court and that failure to do so would result in appropriate action being taken against him.
