In a recent court order, two individuals who were accused of possessing snake venom without authorization under the Wild Life Protection Act were granted bail. The court considered the opposition of the Public Prosecutor but was satisfied that the accused could be granted bail with appropriate conditions.

The bail application was made by the accused, who were represented by their counsel. The counsel argued that the accused were not involved in any illegal activity and that they had been falsely implicated in the case. The counsel further submitted that the accused were ready to cooperate with the investigating officer and that they would not abscond if granted bail.

The Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application, arguing that the accused were involved in a serious offence and that they could tamper with the evidence if released on bail. The Public Prosecutor also submitted that the accused had a criminal history and that they were likely to commit similar offences if released on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court considered the facts and circumstances of the case. The court noted that the accused were not involved in any other criminal case and that they had cooperated with the investigating officer during the investigation. The court also observed that the accused had no intention to abscond and that they were ready to comply with any condition imposed by the court.

The court, therefore, granted bail to the accused on the condition that they execute bonds and make themselves available for interrogation by the investigating officer. The court also directed the accused to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence. The court warned the accused that any violation of the conditions would result in the cancellation of their bail.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case before granting bail. The court was satisfied that the accused could be granted bail with appropriate conditions, taking into account their cooperation with the investigating officer and their willingness to comply with the conditions imposed by the court. The order also serves as a reminder to the accused that they must comply with the conditions of their bail and cooperate with the investigation to avoid any further legal consequences.
