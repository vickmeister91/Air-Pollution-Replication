The Telangana High Court recently heard a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioner was accused of cheating the government and the public by packing vegetable fat spread under the Ag-Mark insignia without a valid Certificate of Authorization. The petitioner argued that the proceedings should be quashed unless the company is also arraigned as an accused. However, the court ultimately did not quash the proceedings and allowed for the possibility of impleading the company as an accused.

The court order states that the petitioner, who is the General Manager of M/s.3F Industries Limited, cannot be held responsible for the offences punishable under Sections 420 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Act as the company was not impleaded as a party. The court also refers to previous judgments and states that the prosecution cannot be maintained against the petitioner in the absence of the company being arraigned as an accused. However, the court notes that the defect is curable and can be cured by impleading the company at an appropriate stage. The court also mentions that the company obtained a license under the Act, but used the Ag-mark insignia on packed products even after the license had expired, causing loss to the government. The court concludes that the proceedings against the petitioner cannot be quashed, as the defect is curable and the company was not arraigned as an accused.

In another court order, the court states that the Managing Director of a company cannot be prosecuted for offences punishable under Section 420 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Act unless the company itself is arraigned as an accused. The court also holds that the General Manager of the company can be held liable for the acts of the company if he is responsible for day-to-day affairs such as packing and marking. The court cites various legal principles and precedents to support its decision. Additionally, the court rejects the argument that a curable defect in the case can be ignored and allows the prosecution to continue without the company being named as an accused.

The court order further states that a company can be held liable for criminal acts committed by its staff, and that the principle of "alter ego" can be applied to attribute mens rea (criminal intent) to the company's representative. The court cites several judgments to support this principle, and concludes that the acts of the petitioner (the company's Civil Engineer, General Manager) are attributable to the company, and therefore the company must be arraigned as an accused before the petitioner can be prosecuted for the alleged offences. The court quashes the proceedings against the petitioner.

In yet another court order, the court states that since no action has been taken by the respondent-State, the proceedings against the petitioner/A.2 are to be quashed. The reason for this is that M/s. 3F Industries Limited was not arraigned as an accused, even though the acts are attributable to the company by principle of 'alter ego'. The Criminal Petition is allowed and the proceedings against the petitioner/A.2 are quashed for the offences punishable under Section 420 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Agriculture Produce (Grading & Marking) Act, 1937.

In summary, the Telangana High Court heard a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to quash proceedings against the petitioner for offenses under Section 420 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Agriculture Produce (Grading & Marking) Act, 1937. The court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioner arguing that the proceedings should be quashed unless the company is also arraigned as an accused. The court ultimately did not quash the proceedings and allowed for the possibility of impleading the company as an accused. The court held that the Managing Director of a company cannot be prosecuted for offences punishable under Section 420 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Act unless the company itself is arraigned as an accused. The court also held that a company can be held liable for criminal acts committed by its staff, and that the principle of "alter ego" can be applied to attribute mens rea (criminal intent) to the company's representative. The court quashed the proceedings against the petitioner in one case, while in another case, the proceedings were quashed due to the company not being arraigned as an accused.
