The interpretation of the term "wood oil" in forest acts has been a subject of debate in various courts in India. In three separate court orders, the issue of whether sandalwood oil should be considered wood oil and a forest produce has been discussed. The courts have applied the doctrine of purposive interpretation to aid in the conservation of sandalwood and prevent illicit trade.

In the first case, the jurisdiction of the trial court was challenged on the premise that sandalwood oil was not wood oil as defined under the Kerala Forest Act, 1961. The High Court had quashed the complaint, but subsequently, a Division Bench held that sandalwood oil was a forest produce within the meaning of the Act. The Supreme Court allowed the appeals of the State and held that sandalwood oil is wood oil within the meaning of the Act and is a forest produce. The court also applied the doctrine of purposive interpretation and held that the literal interpretation would lead to the frustration of the purpose of the Act. The trial court was held to have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial.

Similarly, in the second case, the accused argued that sandalwood oil should not be included in the definition of wood oil under the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963. The court rejected this argument and held that sandalwood oil should be included in the definition of wood oil, as the term should be interpreted purposively to aid in the conservation of sandalwood and prevent illicit trade. The court also noted that sandalwood oil is included in the definition of forest produce in the Karnataka Act.

In the third case, the court reiterated that sandalwood oil is considered a forest produce and falls under the definition of wood oil according to the Karnataka Act. The purpose of this interpretation is to conserve sandalwood, prevent illegal transportation, and hold manufacturers accountable for possessing sandalwood trees or chips. The court cited various cases to support their interpretation and concluded that the trial court has jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of the accused for the offense of possessing sandalwood oil.

In all three cases, the courts have applied the doctrine of purposive interpretation to aid in the conservation of sandalwood and prevent illicit trade. The literal interpretation of the term "wood oil" would have excluded sandalwood oil, which is produced through an industrial process using sandalwood as raw material, from the definition of wood oil. However, the courts have held that the term should be interpreted purposively to include sandalwood oil in the definition of wood oil and forest produce.

The purpose of including sandalwood oil in the definition of wood oil and forest produce is to conserve sandalwood, which is an endangered species, and prevent illegal transportation. Sandalwood oil is a valuable commodity, and its illegal trade has led to the depletion of sandalwood trees. By including sandalwood oil in the definition of wood oil and forest produce, the courts have made it easier for law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal transportation and possession of sandalwood oil.

In conclusion, the courts have interpreted the term "wood oil" purposively to include sandalwood oil in the definition of wood oil and forest produce. This interpretation aids in the conservation of sandalwood and prevents illicit trade. The courts have held that the trial courts have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of the accused for the offense of possessing sandalwood oil.
