The court order in question relates to a case where an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was rejected by the trial court. The applicant had requested the complainant to produce certain documents, including the ledger and income tax record, in order to establish that a cheque of Rs. 15 lacs had been issued. The trial court had rejected this application, prompting the applicant to appeal the decision.

Upon review, the court allowed the application and set aside the impugned order dated 27-06-2015. The trial court was directed to take appropriate action in accordance with the law. This decision was likely based on the fact that the documents requested by the applicant were relevant to the case and could potentially provide important evidence.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a court to issue an order requiring the production of any document or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This section is often used in criminal cases to obtain evidence that may be crucial to the outcome of the case.

In this particular case, the applicant had requested the production of certain documents in order to establish that a cheque of Rs. 15 lacs had been issued. It is unclear from the court order what the nature of the case was or what the cheque was for, but it is likely that the documents requested were relevant to the case and could potentially provide important evidence.

The fact that the trial court had initially rejected the application under section 91 is somewhat surprising, as this section is generally interpreted broadly in order to allow for the production of any document or material that may be relevant to a case. However, it is possible that the trial court had some reason for rejecting the application, such as a belief that the documents requested were not relevant or that they were protected by some form of privilege.

In any case, the decision of the higher court to allow the application and set aside the impugned order is significant, as it reaffirms the importance of allowing parties to obtain relevant evidence in criminal cases. The trial court will now be required to take appropriate action in accordance with the law, which may include ordering the production of the requested documents or taking other steps to ensure that the evidence is properly considered in the case.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in allowing parties to obtain relevant evidence in criminal cases. It also underscores the need for trial courts to interpret this section broadly in order to ensure that all relevant evidence is considered in a case.
