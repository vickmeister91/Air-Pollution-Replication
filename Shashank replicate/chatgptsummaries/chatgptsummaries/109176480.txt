The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s E. Tech Projects Private Limited against the State of Chhattisgarh and others, challenging the legality and propriety of an order granting permission to establish a Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility. The respondents argued that the writ petition is not maintainable as the reliefs claimed are covered under the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court considered the definition of "substantial question relating to environment" and the provisions of Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Act, 2010, and concluded that the writ petition filed by the petitioner for enforcement of its commercial interest cannot be entertained.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in relation to civil cases involving the environment. The court states that the NGT only has jurisdiction over civil cases that involve a substantial question relating to the environment and arise out of the implementation of enactments specified in Schedule-I. The court also notes that the NGT does not have the power to pronounce upon the vires of any statutory provision or subordinate legislation. The court concludes that the present petition does not raise any substantial question relating to the environment and is therefore not cognizable by the NGT. The matter is directed to be listed for final disposal at motion stage on a specific date.

This means that the NGT cannot declare any law or regulation unconstitutional or invalid.
