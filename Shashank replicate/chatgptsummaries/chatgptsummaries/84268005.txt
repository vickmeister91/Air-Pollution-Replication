The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bachchu under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for his arrest in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand by a truck which belongs to him. The court rejected the application, stating that there was no new ground or change in circumstances to adopt a different view. However, the applicant is at liberty to revive the application after suffering a considerable period of custody.

This is a common concern in cases where the accused has a history of tampering with witnesses or has the means to do so. The prosecution argued that the accused had a vested interest in tampering with the witnesses as they were the ones who could provide evidence against him.

The court took into consideration the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense and came to the conclusion that the accused should not be granted bail. The court's decision was based on the fact that there was no new ground or change in circumstances to adopt a different view.
