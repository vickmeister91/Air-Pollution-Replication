The National Green Tribunal recently heard an application filed by M/S Athiappa Chemicals challenging an order issued by the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The order directed the Applicant to stop all manufacturing activities until three directions were complied with. The Applicant argued that the appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act was not an effective remedy and that the NGT had jurisdiction to entertain the application. However, the NGT disagreed and stated that the Applicant must exhaust all forums available under the Act, including the appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act, before approaching the NGT directly.

The court order states that an application cannot be entertained if it allows the applicant to bypass the statutory appeal process. The applicant must exhaust all forums available under the Act, including the appeal under Section 31 of Air Act, before approaching the Tribunal directly. The Tribunal cannot entertain such an application, and any substantial question of law arising under Section 14 of the NGT Act cannot be considered. The application in question is not maintainable and is devoid of merits, and therefore, it is dismissed at the admission stage.
