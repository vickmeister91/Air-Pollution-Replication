The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is the de facto complainant and the accused are facing prosecution for various offences. The petitioner had filed a petition to assist the prosecution, which was dismissed by the trial court. The petitioner challenged this dismissal in the High Court.

The High Court allowed the petitioner to engage a counsel to assist the Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of the case. However, the court also stated that the de facto complainant can only file written arguments with the permission of the court, after evidence is closed in the case. This means that the petitioner cannot actively participate in the proceedings, but can only provide written arguments at a later stage.

The court also noted that the victim is no longer an alien in criminal proceedings. This means that victims have a right to participate in criminal proceedings and be informed of the progress of the case. However, the court also stated that victims cannot file applications or pray for further investigation on their own. This means that victims can only participate in the proceedings through their counsel or with the permission of the court.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to engage a counsel to assist the prosecution is significant as it recognizes the importance of the victim's role in criminal proceedings. The court's decision also ensures that the victim's interests are represented in the proceedings, even if they cannot actively participate.

However, the court's decision to limit the petitioner's participation to written arguments only may be seen as a limitation on the victim's rights. The petitioner may feel that they are not able to fully participate in the proceedings and that their voice is not being heard.

The court's decision to limit the victim's ability to file applications or pray for further investigation on their own may also be seen as a limitation on the victim's rights. Victims may feel that they are not able to fully participate in the proceedings and that their interests are not being fully represented.

Overall, the court's decision recognizes the importance of the victim's role in criminal proceedings and ensures that their interests are represented. However, the decision may also be seen as a limitation on the victim's rights and their ability to fully participate in the proceedings.
