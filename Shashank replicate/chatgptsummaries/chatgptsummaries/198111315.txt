The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Gulf Goans Hotels Co. Ltd. and the Union of India regarding the demolition of hotels, beach resorts, and beach bungalows in Goa. The respondent, Goa Foundation, filed writ petitions for the demolition of the allegedly illegal constructions raised by the appellants. The High Court upheld the orders passed by the authorities requiring the appellants to demolish the existing structures. The constructions raised by the appellants were not per se illegal but were in derogation of the environmental guidelines in force. The guidelines were not law, but the State claimed that they were in implementation of India's international commitments and engrafted a legal framework by executive action under Article 73 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court considered the stand of the rival parties and held that a balancing act was necessary, which would lean in favor of the protection of the property having regard to the long period of time that has elapsed since the impugned action was initiated against the appellants. The court order discusses a case involving the construction of buildings on sea beaches and the guidelines issued by the government to regulate such activities. The Union of India argues that the guidelines are traceable to the power of the Union executive and are necessary to maintain environmental health and ecological balance. The respondent NGO argues that commitments made by the country at international forums must be incorporated into municipal laws.

The court examines the guidelines and concludes that they do not possess the minimum elements of law and are merely suggestions or opinions. The court also notes that the Stockholm Declaration does not provide internationally approved parameters of acceptable distance from the HTL, and therefore, incorporation of any such feature of international values in the Municipal Laws of the country cannot arise. The court order discusses the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and its relevant principles, including the need for states to prevent pollution of the seas and to consider the development potential of developing countries. The order also emphasizes the importance of proper authentication and promulgation of government orders and instruments, and the need for public notification of laws.

The court ultimately sets aside the orders impugned in the writ petitions filed by the appellants. The High Court of Bombay's order has been set aside by the court, as per the appeals allowed. The document also includes references to various legal cases.

In summary, the case involved the demolition of allegedly illegal constructions raised by Gulf Goans Hotels Co. Ltd. on sea beaches in Goa. The constructions were in derogation of the environmental guidelines in force, which were not law but were claimed to be in implementation of India's international commitments. The Supreme Court held that a balancing act was necessary, which would lean in favor of the protection of the property having regard to the long period of time that has elapsed since the impugned action was initiated against the appellants. The court examined the guidelines and concluded that they do not possess the minimum elements of law and are merely suggestions or opinions. The court ultimately set aside the orders impugned in the writ petitions filed by the appellants.
