The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by Ekambaram against A.Poovai Manalan challenging an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate I, Kancheepuram. The dispute is related to a payment of Rs.50,000/- by way of cheques, of which the first cheque was returned with the endorsement Payment stopped by drawer. The petitioner had issued three cheques and also signed on them.
