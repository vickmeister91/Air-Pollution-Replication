Two court orders have been discussed in the given text. The first court order pertains to a case filed by Vijay Sehrawat against D.D.A. The appellant claimed perpetual injunction against the respondent with respect to a property situated in Delhi. The Trial Court dismissed the suit as not maintainable in terms of the existing pleadings of the appellant/plaintiff and the documents relied upon in support of her case. The Court held that the suit was not maintainable as there cannot be direction for correction of the revenue records. The Court also held that a civil suit cannot be disposed of under Order 14 Rule 2 CPC on a preliminary issue only if the preliminary issue is an issue of law.

The second court order discusses a case where a plaintiff claimed ownership of a piece of land, but the defendant argued that it was government land. The court found that there were disputed questions of fact and law that could not be decided as a preliminary issue, and therefore set aside the previous judgment. The court ordered a demarcation of the land and allowed the defendant to amend their written statement if necessary. The court also ordered the injunction application to be disposed of in accordance with the law. The parties were instructed to appear before the District and Sessions Judge, Delhi on a specific date for further proceedings.
