The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a court order pertaining to a group of stone crusher owners who challenged two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners claimed that they had been running their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatened to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners approached the High Court for protection, and the court allowed their writ petitions, quashing the orders and remitting the matter to the Board for deciding afresh.

The court also addressed the issue of maintainability of the petitions, stating that the existence of an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to a person approaching the High Court under its writ jurisdiction. The court rejected the preliminary objection that the petitioners should have filed an appeal instead of invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court. The court also discussed the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the powers of the State Board to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution.

The court rejected the argument that the present case is covered by a previous case where similar orders were upheld. The court upheld the petitioners' claims that the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights have been violated. The court found that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond adequately. The court concluded that the impugned orders passed by the Board are legally unsustainable and invalid.

In another case, a stone crusher company was found to be lacking in pollution control measures. The State Board had issued a show cause notice and refused to renew the company's consent to operate. However, the court found that the notice was vague and the inspection was conducted after the notice was issued. The court also found that the Board had violated principles of natural justice and fundamental rights. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the company's application for renewal of consent within four months. The court also directed the government to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones.

The court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of the Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following the prescribed procedures and principles of natural justice while dealing with matters related to pollution control. It also emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach between the government and the stakeholders to address the issue of pollution caused by stone crushers. The formation of a committee consisting of experts from different fields is a step in the right direction towards finding a sustainable solution to this problem.
