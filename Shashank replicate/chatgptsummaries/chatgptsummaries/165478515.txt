The court order in question pertains to a case between Mohan and the State of Madhya Pradesh, with the case number MCRC-6105-2019. The applicant's counsel has argued that the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is not applicable to the present case, as it was only applicable for a limited period of time and in a specific region.

Specifically, the counsel argues that the Act was only applicable from March 15, 2018 to December 31, 2018, and only for reserved forests in the Dhawda Forest Region. The counsel's argument suggests that the Act cannot be applied to the current case, which may involve different circumstances or regions.

In response to the counsel's argument, the Public Prosecutor has been granted a week's time to seek instructions on whether the provisions of the Act are currently applicable or not. This suggests that the court is willing to consider the applicability of the Act to the case, but wants to ensure that it has accurate information before making a decision.

The fact that the case is listed for the next week indicates that the court is taking a deliberate approach to the matter, and is not rushing to make a decision. This may be because the court recognizes the importance of the case, or because it wants to ensure that all relevant information is considered before making a ruling.

Overall, the court order suggests that there is some uncertainty regarding the applicability of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 to the current case. However, the court is taking steps to clarify this issue and ensure that it has accurate information before making a decision.
