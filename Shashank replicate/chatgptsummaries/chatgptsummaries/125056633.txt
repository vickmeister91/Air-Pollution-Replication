In January 2017, the petitioner, Roy Augustine Akkara, filed two criminal original petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to quash an order passed by the XIV Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, in C.C.Nos.2752 and 2753 of 2010. However, the petitioner later sought permission to withdraw the petitions, which was granted by the court. As a result, both petitions were dismissed as withdrawn on January 25, 2017.

The reason behind the petitioner's decision to withdraw the petitions is not clear from the court order. However, it is possible that the petitioner may have reached a settlement with the other party involved in the case or may have decided to pursue a different legal strategy.

Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. This section allows the High Court to quash any criminal proceedings pending before any subordinate court if it deems it necessary to do so in the interest of justice.

In this case, the petitioner had approached the High Court seeking to quash an order passed by the XIV Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, in two criminal cases. The details of these cases are not mentioned in the court order. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner was not satisfied with the order passed by the lower court and hence sought relief from the High Court.

The XIV Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, is a subordinate court that has the power to try and dispose of criminal cases within its jurisdiction. It is possible that the cases in question were related to a criminal offence that had taken place within the jurisdiction of this court.

The fact that the petitioner sought to withdraw the petitions indicates that he may have had a change of heart or may have realized that pursuing the case further would not be in his best interest. Withdrawing a petition means that the petitioner is voluntarily giving up his right to seek relief from the court. Once a petition is withdrawn, it is deemed to have never been filed before the court.

In conclusion, the court order dated January 25, 2017, pertains to two criminal original petitions filed by Roy Augustine Akkara under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to quash an order passed by the XIV Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, in C.C.Nos.2752 and 2753 of 2010. The petitioner later sought permission to withdraw the petitions, which was granted by the court, and both petitions were dismissed as withdrawn. The reason behind the petitioner's decision to withdraw the petitions is not clear from the court order. However, it is possible that the petitioner may have reached a settlement with the other party involved in the case or may have decided to pursue a different legal strategy.
