The Gomti river, a tributary of the Ganga, is one of the most important rivers in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It originates in the Himalayas and flows through several districts before joining the Ganga in the city of Varanasi. However, over the years, the river has become highly polluted due to the dumping of garbage and waste material by industries and individuals. This has not only affected the health of the river but also the health of the people who depend on it for their daily needs.

In response to a petition filed by public representatives and social workers, the court has issued a writ of mandamus to stop the dumping of garbage and waste material into the river Gomti in District Jaunpur and to make the water of the river Gomti pure and hygienic. The court has expanded the scope of the petition to include all areas through which the river Gomti flows and has directed the State Government to set up a Committee to formulate an action plan for keeping the Gomti river clean and unpolluted throughout its flow from its place of origin to the place where it meets the river Ganga.

The Committee will ensure that no toxic effluents or filth are discharged by any unit into the Gomti river, and polluters are prosecuted under the Water Pollution Act, Environment Protection Act and other Acts. The court has also directed that Chemical Analysts be appointed to take samples from the water of the river Gomti at various locations and submit regular reports. The Committee will submit monthly progress/action reports to the court, and the court will monitor the working of the Committee.

The court's order is a significant step towards protecting the Gomti river and ensuring that it remains clean and unpolluted. The Gomti river is not only an important source of water for the people of Uttar Pradesh but also a vital ecosystem that supports a diverse range of flora and fauna. The pollution of the river has had a severe impact on the health of the people and the environment, and it is essential to take immediate action to address this issue.

The court's order is also a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and the need to hold polluters accountable for their actions. The Committee set up by the State Government will play a crucial role in ensuring that industries and individuals do not pollute the river and that those who do are held accountable under the law.

The appointment of Chemical Analysts to take samples from the water of the river Gomti at various locations and submit regular reports is a significant step towards monitoring the health of the river. The reports submitted by the Chemical Analysts will provide valuable information on the quality of the water and the level of pollution in the river. This information will be used by the Committee to formulate an action plan to address the pollution of the river.

The court's order is a positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that the Gomti river remains clean and unpolluted. It is essential to take immediate action to address the pollution of the river and to hold polluters accountable for their actions. The Committee set up by the State Government will play a crucial role in ensuring that the Gomti river remains clean and unpolluted, and it is essential to monitor the progress of the Committee regularly.
