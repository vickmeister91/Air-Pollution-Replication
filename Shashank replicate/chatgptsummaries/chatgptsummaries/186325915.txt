The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by TCI Industries Ltd against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents regarding the development of a large property owned by TCI Industries Ltd in Mumbai, known as Mukesh Mills. The property is located in the CRZ-II Zone and is claimed to be the only textile mill in South Mumbai. The court heard the case and reserved judgment on 21st September 2013, with the judgment being pronounced on 21st October 2013.

The court order discusses the closure of textile mills in Mumbai due to a strike that lasted for a year. The Mukesh Mills was one of the mills that closed, and in 2003/2004, the State Government allowed its closure. The order also discusses the statutory and legislative regime governing town planning in Mumbai and the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification 1991, which controlled development along India's coastline. The argument presented is that the Mukesh Mills' land is within CRZ-II and cannot be subjected to the discipline of DCR 58 of the 1991 DC Regulations. TCI challenged the refusal of their application to develop the property in Writ Petition No. 2859 of 2006.

The court order discusses the legal proceedings related to the development of Mukesh Mills property by TCI. TCI submitted revised plans for development based on the 1967 DC Rules, which were rejected by the MCGM. TCI had two pending proceedings, one against the rejection of its proposal under the 1991 DC Regulations and the other against the rejection of a revised proposal under the 1967 DC Rules. The Monitoring Committee constituted by the State Government under DCR 58 asked TCI for information about the status of the land, arrears of payment to erstwhile workers, and their rehabilitation. TCI challenged four separate orders or directions of this Monitoring Committee, and the court noted that the challenge to three of these four orders is jurisdictional, not on merits.

The court order pertains to a petition filed by TCI regarding the jurisdiction of the Monitoring Committee over their lands and property on the Mukesh Mill lands. The court clarifies that it is only examining the jurisdiction issue and not the correctness of the directions given by the Monitoring Committee in other orders. The history of Mumbai's mill lands and the introduction of DCR 58, a provision for the development or re-development of lands of cotton textile mills, is discussed. The court notes that DCR 58 covers a wide range of factors and issues and seeks to achieve a wider social objective, including providing affordable housing and creating public open spaces. The court ultimately upholds the jurisdiction of the Monitoring Committee over TCI's lands and property.

The court order establishes a Monitoring Committee, headed by a retired High Court judge, to oversee the implementation of measures recommended by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction for the revival of textile mills. The committee has the power to enforce notices and attendance, prescribe guidelines for the sale or disposal of built-up space, and monitor the implementation of housing and employment schemes for cotton textile mill workers. The court also discusses the importance of balanced town planning and social requirements. The court clarifies that no other regulation or provision can govern the development and redevelopment of textile mill lands, and that the 1991 CRZ Notification has been superseded by the 2011 CRZ Notification. The court also addresses arguments regarding the applicability of DCR 58 to Mukesh Mills.

The court order discusses the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, which was issued in 1991 to protect India's coasts and restrict development in certain areas. The notification is not a planning statute and does not supplant town and country planning regulations. The court also distinguishes this case from a previous one, Suresh Estates, where the Supreme Court held that the 1967 Development Control Rules apply to development projects in CRZ-II areas. The court notes that the CRZ Notification has only frozen the FSI/FAR norms and that the purpose of the notification is to protect the coastal environment and ecology.

The court order discusses the applicability of the CRZ Notification and the 1967 DC Rules to the development of the Mukesh Mills lands. The court rejects the argument that all aspects of the 1991 DC Regulations must be completely excised from consideration and emphasizes the wider social objectives of DCR 58. The court also notes that the CRZ Notification seeks only to restrict development in certain areas, not to completely freeze development.

The court order discusses the conflict between town planning considerations and environmental protection in the context of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification. The court notes that the CRZ Notification seeks to restrict development in certain areas to achieve coastal environmental protection. The court also highlights the wide primacy of the Environmental Protection Act (EP Act) and its rules and orders in matters of environmental protection and conservation. The court rejects the argument that town planning considerations under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act stand ousted or eclipsed by the EP Act. The court emphasizes the need to harmonize environmental protection and town planning considerations to achieve a sustainable, livable urban environment. The court also notes that the demands of environmental and ecological protection are not inimical to those of sound town planning and that both are long-term, forward-looking measures. The court rejects the argument that the CRZ Notification seeks to permit more development at the cost of the coastal environment
