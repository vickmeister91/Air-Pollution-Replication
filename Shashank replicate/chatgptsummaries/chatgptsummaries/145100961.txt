The Supreme Court of India heard a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. The PIL challenged the legality and validity of the actions of the State of Tamil Nadu, the Collector of Nilgiris District, the District Forest Officer of Gudalur, and the Timber Committee represented through the Collector of Nilgiris. The petitioner alleged that the respondents had allowed trespassers to encroach and enter upon the forest land for the purpose of felling trees and conversion of forest land into plantations. The destruction of rain forests would adversely affect the environment, eco-system, the plants, and animals living within the forests. The petitioner highlighted that the respondents had violated the Forest Act, 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Tamil Nadu Hill Stations Preservation of Trees Act, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court issued various directions, including the creation of a Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) to be managed by a body composed of a Director General of Forest, Special Secretary, and Inspector General of Forest. The court directed that all funds received from user-agencies for compensatory afforestation be deposited in the CAF and utilized for afforestation as per permissions granted. Additionally, the court directed that the net value of forest land diverted for non-forest purposes be paid into the CAF by user-agencies. The court order establishes a Compensatory Afforestation Fund to be created for the recovery of forest land converted for non-forest use. The fund will be managed by the Ministry of Environment & Forests and will receive all monies received from user-agencies towards compensatory afforestation. The fund will also be used for protection and conservation activities in protected areas. The order emphasizes the need to use local and indigenous species for plantations and involves user agencies in undertaking compensatory afforestation. The Court also recognized the need to take all precautionary measures when forests land are sought to be diverted for non-forestry use, and the creation of CAF was approved.

The court approved the creation of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) as a precautionary measure when forests are diverted for non-forestry use. The State is required to take short and long-term measures for environmental protection. The court has fixed rates for Non-Productive Value (NPV) payable for non-forestry use of forest land and exempted payment for certain purposes. An Ad-hoc body was created to manage the funds collected from user-agencies for NPV, and the money has been transferred to the Ad-hoc CAMPA. The State CAMPA has been set up to accelerate activities for preservation of natural forests, management of wildlife, infrastructure development, and other allied works. The court has permitted the Ad-hoc CAMPA to release funds to the State CAMPA for utilization, protection, and improvement of the national environment. Different states have filed applications seeking release of funds for completing the task of compulsory afforestation. The relief claimed in all the applications is almost identical.

The court order discusses an application made by several states requesting that the funds available with CAMPA be made available to State CAMPAs in a substantial ratio to the amounts collected from the State/Union Territories. The court directed the Central Empowered Committee to submit a report on the matter, and the committee recommended that the Ad-hoc CAMPA release an amount equal to 10% of the principle amount lying to the credit of each State/UT at the beginning of the year to the respective State CAMPA, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include utilizing interest received/receivable by the Ad-hoc CAMPA and the funds being released after approval by the Steering Committee of the respective State CAMPA.

The court order pertains to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on Compensatory Afforestation in India. The court accepts the recommendations made by the CEC and modifies certain directions. The Ad-hoc CAMPA is permitted to release annual funds subject to certain conditions, and no money can be transferred or utilized without the leave of the court. The National CAMPA Advisory Council is directed to file a status report within three months regarding the monitoring and evaluation of the works being undertaken. The interlocutory applications are disposed of with the aforesaid directions.

In summary, the court order pertains to a PIL filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad challenging the legality and validity of the actions of the State of Tamil Nadu, the Collector, Nilgiris District and the District Forest Officer, Gudalur and the Timber Committee represented through the Collector, Nilgiris in destroying the tropical rain forest in the Gudalur and Nilgiri areas in violation of the Forest Act, 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Tamil Nadu Hill Stations Preservation of Trees Act and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court issued various directions, including the creation of a Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) to be managed by a body composed of a Director General of Forest, Special Secretary, and Inspector General of Forest. The court directed that all funds received from user-agencies for compensatory afforestation be deposited in the CAF and utilized for afforestation as per permissions granted
