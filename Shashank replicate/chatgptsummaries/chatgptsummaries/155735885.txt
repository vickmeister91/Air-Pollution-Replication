The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has sought the vacation of two interim orders granted by the court in 2015. The orders pertain to the identification of approximately 10 acres of land for a cluster bus depot in the Rohini area of Delhi. The DDA claims that a meeting was held under the Chairmanship of the Lt. Governor of Delhi, in which it was decided to explore and identify the land for allotment to the Transport Department of the Government of NCT of Delhi. The DDA started inviting objections and suggestions with respect to the approval for the issue of a public notice, which was issued and published in the Gazette of India, Part-II, Sector-3, Sub-Section (ii) on 31.07.2015 in four newspapers.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision. The court examined a site plan and found that 90% of the work pertaining to a drain is completed. The interim orders dated 20.04.2015 are vacated, and all grounds raised by the petitioners in the writ petitions are kept open. The applications stand disposed of, and the case is listed for further hearing on 01.08.2018.
