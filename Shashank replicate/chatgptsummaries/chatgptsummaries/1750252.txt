The High Court of Judicature at Madras recently heard a criminal revision case filed by M. Sathiamoorthi against the State. The petitioner was accused of being involved in a criminal conspiracy to cheat the Government of India and Tamil Nadu in the matter of construction/erection of cremation sheds under JRY schemes. The petitioner had filed a petition seeking production of certain documents under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was dismissed by the trial court. The petitioner then filed a criminal revision case seeking to set aside the order passed by the trial court and order issuance of summons to the persons named in the petition to cause production of the documents referred to in the petition.

During the hearing, the court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the petition, confirming the order of the trial court. The court ruled that the accused is not entitled to file such a petition and it is unnecessary for the court to order such an application. The court has to make its own decision on a subject based on the facts and circumstances of the case and the law.
