The court order pertains to an appeal filed by M/s. Singapore Reality Private Limited against an order passed in Application No. 6457 of 2016 in C.S. Diary No. 22017 of 2016. The learned single Judge had dismissed the application filed by the respondents seeking leave to sue the appellant/defendant in the suit and directed the Registry to return the plaint and the application for amendment of the plaint filed by the respondents. The appeal was filed on the ground that the suit filed by the plaintiffs/respondents is nothing but a re-litigation and therefore, the plaint itself ought to have been rejected even before numbering the same. The facts of the case relate to the setting up of an Integrated Knowledge Industry Township at the Information Technology Park, Siruseri, Chennai.

The Government of Tamil Nadu entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Lee Kim Teh Holding Limited to offer lands for setting up a township at a prefixed price. However, a dispute arose when the appellant did not obtain environmental clearance for the project, leading to the cancellation of the Memorandum of Understanding. The appellant filed writ petitions, which were allowed by the court, and subsequent appeals by the respondents were dismissed. The appellant then attempted to tender the balance sale consideration, but the respondents refused to accept it, leading to another writ petition.

The court order states that a writ petition was allowed by the court to receive the balance sale consideration from the petitioner as per the direction issued by the court in 2012. The court also mentions that a civil suit has not been filed by the respondent or the government. The order further discusses an application seeking leave to sue the defendant and to amend the plaint, which was dismissed by the learned single judge. The appellant challenges the order and argues that the plaint should have been rejected instead of being returned to the respondents. The appellant contends that the dispute has already been settled by the Supreme Court, and there is no cause of action for filing a civil suit.

The court has dismissed an application seeking leave to file a civil suit, stating that it would only prolong the litigation and frustrate the appellant's attempt to regain their legitimate right to proceed with transactions covered in a Memorandum of Understanding. The court also cites previous cases to support the notion that even at the stage of granting leave, a plaint can be rejected if it is hopelessly barred by any law. The court ultimately affirms the impugned order and compensates the first respondent.

The court order affirms a previous decision and orders the appellant to compensate the respondent with costs of Rs. 20,000. The appellant argues that the respondent's lawsuit is a re-litigation of issues already settled by the court, but the respondent argues that the lawsuit seeks a different remedy. The court concludes that the lawsuit can proceed and dismisses the appeal.

The court order discusses a case where the Government of Tamil Nadu cancelled a Memorandum of Understanding with a Singaporean company, alleging breach of terms and conditions. The company challenged the cancellation in court, arguing that it was in violation of natural justice. The court agreed with the company and quashed the cancellation order, citing several reasons including the lack of a show cause notice and the baselessness of the cancellation. The court also noted that the company had applied for environmental clearance and made arrangements to fulfill obligations under the EIA notification.

The court order states that the petitioner was given possession of lands through the execution of MoU and sale deeds, and had already applied for necessary approvals. The government's order did not impose a permanent or total ban on the project, and therefore, the land allotment orders and MoU were not frustrated or impossible. There was no clause for reconveyance of the property, and the ownership and title had already been transferred to the petitioner. The respondents had induced the petitioner to invest a huge amount in the project, and the cancellation of the orders violated the principles of natural justice and constituted an arbitrary exercise of power. The writ petitions were allowed, and the impugned orders were set aside. The respondents' appeals were dismissed by the Division Bench and the Supreme Court.

This is a court order regarding a case where the respondents filed a suit against the defendant for breach of contract and requested cancellation of sale deeds and reconveyance of lands. The respondents also filed two applications seeking leave to sue the defendant and to amend the plaint. The learned single Judge refused to grant leave to sue the defendant before this Court but directed the Registry to return the plaint so that the respondents could institute a suit before the Court having territorial jurisdiction. The appellant/defendant filed an appeal on the ground that the plaint ought to have been rejected as it amounts to re-litigation. The court examined whether a plaint could be rejected at the threshold, even before it is being numbered and/or entertained, by rendering a finding as regards the merits of the plaint, especially when the plaintiff has filed an application seeking leave to sue the defendants.

The court order discusses the rejection of a plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It states that a plaint can only be rejected if it does not disclose a cause of action, is undervalued, filed in the wrong court, or barred by law. Once a plaint is numbered, it can only be rejected at the instance of the defendant through the procedures under Order VII Rule 11. The court also notes that a litigant cannot be prevented from instituting a suit, and the
