The court order pertains to two separate cases where the Pollution Board was involved in disputes with different petitioners. In the first case, M/s. Kundan Mill Board & Paper Mills challenged the demands raised by the Pollution Board in a writ petition. The court ruled in favor of the Pollution Board, stating that they were justified in undertaking a 'best judgment assessment' and passing orders in that manner. The court also considered whether the manner in which the 'best judgment assessment' was carried out was sustainable in law. 

The court found that the Pollution Board had taken into consideration the capacity of the petitioner as 5 metric tons, and on that basis, water consumption was calculated in the absence of actual record, which could be furnished by the petitioner. The court also noted that the petitioner had not deposited the fee of the consultant, which could have helped to sort out the issue. The court ultimately ruled that the Pollution Board was justified in its assessment and that the petitioner's claims were not supported by the evidence on record.

In the second case, the petitioner had obtained consent from the Pollution Board for a factory with an installed capacity of 2.5 tons, but the Pollution Board had given consent for three tons. The court found that the assessment of the factory's capacity should have been based on the consent order and not on the No Objection Certificate (NOC) given by the Pollution Board. The court modified the assessment reducing the amount by 40% and ordered the petitioner to pay 60% of the assessed amount with interest.

In the first case, the court had to determine whether the Pollution Board was justified in undertaking a 'best judgment assessment' and passing orders in that manner. The court found that the Pollution Board had taken into consideration the capacity of the petitioner as 5 metric tons, and on that basis, water consumption was calculated in the absence of actual record, which could be furnished by the petitioner. The court also noted that the petitioner had not deposited the fee of the consultant, which could have helped to sort out the issue. The court ultimately ruled that the Pollution Board was justified in its assessment and that the petitioner's claims were not supported by the evidence on record.

The court's ruling in this case is significant as it upholds the authority of the Pollution Board to undertake a 'best judgment assessment' in cases where there is a lack of actual record. This means that the Pollution Board can use its discretion to make an assessment based on the available information and pass orders accordingly. However, the court also noted that the assessment must be sustainable in law and that the Pollution Board must take into consideration all relevant factors before passing an order.

In the second case, the court had to determine whether the assessment of the factory's capacity should have been based on the consent order or the NOC given by the Pollution Board. The court found that the assessment should have been based on the consent order and not the NOC. The court modified the assessment reducing the amount by 40% and ordered the petitioner to pay 60% of the assessed amount with interest.

The court's ruling in this case is significant as it clarifies the basis on which the capacity of a factory should be assessed. The court held that the assessment should be based on the consent order and not on any other document such as an NOC. This means that the Pollution Board must take into consideration the consent order while assessing the capacity of a factory and passing orders accordingly.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of complying with the regulations set by the Pollution Board. The court has upheld the authority of the Pollution Board to undertake a 'best judgment assessment' in cases where there is a lack of actual record. However, the assessment must be sustainable in law and the Pollution Board must take into consideration all relevant factors before passing an order. The court has also clarified the basis on which the capacity of a factory should be assessed, which is based on the consent order and not on any other document such as an NOC.
