The Gujarat High Court recently quashed a complaint filed against the managing directors and directors of Cellulose Products of India Ltd. for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the complaint did not disclose any offence against the petitioners and that necessary averments were missing in the complaint. The court allowed the petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and ordered the complaint to be quashed. However, the court made it clear that the first respondent could proceed ahead in accordance with the provisions made in Section 319 of the Code.

The case was filed against the managing directors and directors of Cellulose Products of India Ltd. for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complaint was filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) alleging that the company had violated the provisions of the Act by discharging untreated effluent into the river. The GPCB had also alleged that the company had not obtained the necessary consent from the board for the discharge of effluent.

The court found that the complaint did not disclose any offence against the petitioners and that necessary averments were missing in the complaint. The court observed that the complaint did not specify the nature of the effluent discharged by the company, the quantity of effluent discharged, the place of discharge, and the date of discharge. The court also noted that the complaint did not specify the provisions of the Act that had been violated by the company.

The court allowed the petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and ordered the complaint to be quashed. Section 482 of the Code empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The court held that the complaint was liable to be quashed as it did not disclose any offence against the petitioners.

However, the court made it clear that the first respondent could proceed ahead in accordance with the provisions made in Section 319 of the Code. Section 319 of the Code empowers the court to add any person not being the accused before it to the proceedings if it appears to the court that such person is likely to be guilty of the offence charged.

The court's decision has been welcomed by the industry as it provides relief to the directors and managing directors of companies who are often held responsible for the actions of the company. The decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that complaints filed against companies are specific and contain all necessary averments.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's decision to quash the complaint filed against the managing directors and directors of Cellulose Products of India Ltd. for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, highlights the importance of ensuring that complaints filed against companies are specific and contain all necessary averments.
