The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Nathu Ram regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders, directing the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board to inspect the canals and report on the pollution being caused, and the sources of pollution. The NGT also directed the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and find out whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water and file a status report.

In another court order, the State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples from distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state was also directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal. The court imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court also requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records of a related case.

The state was warned of a cost of Rs. 50,000 if they fail to submit a comprehensive short and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court directed the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date and imposes a cost if the state fails to submit the required reports. The state was directed to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The court also directed the state to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for the purpose. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose the number of encroachers who had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments.

The State Government was also directed to issue notice to persons who were contributing to pollution as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The court observed that the notices issued were not in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal. The State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, or appropriate action would be taken. The court also directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water.

In another court order, the Counsel for the State was given another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also ordered the applicant's Counsel to file a counter affidavit by the next date of hearing. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental issues.

The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

In the final court order, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and had not violated principles of natural justice. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation. The NGT was expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State was free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters after 31st December, 2016.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the measures that the state needs to take to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and find out whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water and file a status report. The court imposed fines on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the state to make citizens aware of this
