The court orders discussed pertain to various issues related to the Adani Vizhinjam Ports (P) Ltd. and its construction projects in Kerala. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Dileep alleging that Adani Vizhinjam Ports (P) Ltd. had constructed a structure at Muthalapozhi Fishing Harbour in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone Notification 2019. The petitioner sought a direction to the Central Government, State Government, Harbour Engineering Department, and Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority to demolish the said structure and for other consequential reliefs. The court observed that the issue of illegality in the action of the 8th respondent in granting permission is a separate issue which needs to be agitated in appropriate proceedings. The court also noted that KCZMA had granted clearance for the construction, which is produced as Ext.P2. The court order further details the decisions taken by KCZMA in its meetings and the impugned order passed.

The second court order pertains to the Vizhinjam Major Port Project and the transportation of quarry materials for its development. The order states that the necessary Environmental Clearance was obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, and that an MoU was entered into between Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt. Ltd. and the Harbour Engineering Department of Kerala for transporting granite stones using Muthalapozhi Harbour to Vizhinjam Port. The order also mentions the Concessionaire for the project, Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited, and the estimated project cost for Phase I. The order further discusses the proposed construction of a loadout facility at Muthalapozhi fishing harbour and the advantages it would bring to the state of Kerala.

The third court order discusses a case where a construction project was carried out without prior permission from the Coastal Regulation Zone Management Authority (KCZMA). The petitioner argued that the new Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2019 overrides the 1991 and 2011 notifications and that the construction should be demolished. However, the court found that the project had already obtained CRZ clearance and was being carried out in the larger public interest. The court dismissed the writ petition and did not issue any directions as sought by the petitioner.

In summary, the court orders discussed pertain to various issues related to the Adani Vizhinjam Ports (P) Ltd. and its construction projects in Kerala. The court orders provide details about the necessary clearances obtained for the projects, the proposed construction of loadout facilities, and the decisions taken by the KCZMA in its meetings.
