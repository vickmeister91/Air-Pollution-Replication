In a recent court order, the petitioner was granted permission to withdraw their petition with the liberty to avail the remedy of appeal provided under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The case was subsequently dismissed as withdrawn.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control water pollution.

In this particular case, the petitioner had filed a petition seeking relief under the provisions of the Act. However, for reasons that are not clear from the court order, the petitioner subsequently decided to withdraw their petition.

The court order granting permission to withdraw the petition with the liberty to avail the remedy of appeal provided under Section 33B (c) of the Act is significant. Section 33B (c) provides that any person aggrieved by an order made by the pollution control board may appeal to the appellate authority within a period of thirty days from the date on which the order is communicated to him.

By granting the petitioner the liberty to avail this remedy of appeal, the court has ensured that the petitioner's rights are protected and that they have the opportunity to challenge any adverse order that may be made by the pollution control board in the future.

It is important to note that the court order does not provide any details about the nature of the relief sought by the petitioner or the reasons for their decision to withdraw the petition. It is therefore difficult to comment on the merits of the case or the implications of the court order for water pollution control in India.

However, the fact that the court has granted the petitioner the liberty to avail the remedy of appeal provided under Section 33B (c) of the Act is a positive development. It demonstrates the court's commitment to protecting the rights of individuals and ensuring that they have access to effective remedies in cases of environmental harm.

Overall, the court order allowing the petitioner to withdraw their petition with the liberty to avail the remedy of appeal provided under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is a significant development in the field of environmental law in India. It highlights the importance of protecting the rights of individuals and ensuring that they have access to effective remedies in cases of environmental harm.
