The Managing Director of Zuari Industries Limited had filed a Criminal Revision Petition in the court seeking to quash a complaint filed against him for offences under the Fertilizer Control Order and the Essential Commodities Act. The complaint alleged that the company had supplied sub-standard quality fertilizer. The petitioner argued that the Compliance Officer appointed by the company should be held responsible, not him. 

The court heard the arguments of both parties and examined the relevant provisions of the Fertilizer Control Order and the Essential Commodities Act. The court observed that the Compliance Officer appointed by the company was responsible for ensuring that the fertilizer supplied by the company met the required standards. The Managing Director, being the head of the company, could not be held responsible for the actions of the Compliance Officer.

The court further noted that the complainant could initiate fresh proceedings against the appropriate Compliance Officer. The court, therefore, quashed the proceedings against the petitioner and directed the complainant to initiate fresh proceedings against the Compliance Officer responsible for the quality of the fertilizer supplied by the company.

The decision of the court is significant as it clarifies the responsibilities of the Compliance Officer and the Managing Director of a company in cases of non-compliance with the Fertilizer Control Order and the Essential Commodities Act. The court has held that the Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, and the Managing Director cannot be held responsible for the actions of the Compliance Officer.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of appointing a competent Compliance Officer who is well-versed with the relevant laws and regulations. The Compliance Officer plays a crucial role in ensuring that the company complies with the applicable laws and regulations and avoids legal liabilities.
