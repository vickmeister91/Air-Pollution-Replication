The Church of God (Full Gospel) in India had appealed a court order that directed them to reduce noise pollution caused by their use of loudspeakers and drums during prayers. The court stated that no religion prescribes disturbing the peace of others and that activities that disturb the sleep of others, including young babies, students, and the elderly, cannot be permitted. The court also noted that noise pollution has many negative effects, including health problems, and that the right to practice religion is subject to the provisions of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which protects citizens from being coerced to hear anything they do not like or require. The court directed the authorities to follow guidelines laid down in previous cases and the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.

The court order outlines rules and regulations for controlling noise pollution, including the definition of a silence zone and restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and public address systems. Violations of these rules can result in penalties. The court also emphasizes the need for enforcement of these rules and the lack of awareness among citizens and authorities. The appeal is dismissed.
