The National Green Tribunal received an application from Padmabati Mohapatra challenging the grant of Environment Clearance by the Ministry of Environment & Forests for the establishment of a coal-based thermal power plant in Cuttack, Orissa. Mohapatra claimed that the plant would result in environmental pollution and adversely affect the ecology of the district. The application was filed after a delay of 23 days, which the respondent-company opposed, stating that the order had been published on their website and in newspapers. The MoEF also contended that the order was communicated to the applicant when it was put up on their website. The Tribunal had to determine whether the application was barred by time and if the delay could be condoned.

The court order states that a delay in filing an appeal cannot be condoned by the Tribunal. The primary factors to determine if an application is barred by time are when the order was communicated and if sufficient cause has been shown for condoning the delay. The MoEF was expected to upload the order of EC on its website within seven days of passing the order and put it on its notice board for at least 30 days. The project proponent should upload the order permanently on its website and publish it in two local newspapers. The applicant claims that he came to know about the order during a hearing in a writ petition and filed an appeal within 23 days of knowing about it. The major challenge of the applicant is to the EIA proceedings and the report, which may require examination by the Tribunal.

The court order states that certain orders were passed without obtaining permission from the High Court of Orissa, which violated its stay order. The applicant was able to show sufficient cause for a 23-day delay in filing an appeal, and the respondents failed to discharge their obligations in accordance with the law. The communication of the order was incomplete, so the limitation cannot be reckoned from any of the dates stated by the respondents. The delay of 23 days in filing the appeal is condoned, and the application is allowed, with parties bearing their own costs.
