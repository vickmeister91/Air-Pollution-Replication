The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has heard several writ petitions related to sand quarrying in the Tamiraparani river basin. The court considered the impact of sand quarrying on the river's flow, water supply for irrigation and drinking, and the need for scientific sand quarrying. The Tamiraparani river is considered holy and is used for bathing, and its water is used for drinking, irrigation, and industrial purposes. The court noted the importance of proper infrastructure management to meet the water needs of the people and industries in the region. The court also considered the ancient system of water regulation and use for irrigation, which is more economical and involves the construction of sluice gates. The court heard several petitions seeking a writ of mandamus to prevent illegal sand mining and to cancel permissions granted for sand quarrying.

The court order discusses the regulation and use of water for irrigation in the Tamiraparani river basin, including the construction of reservoirs and small dams. It also mentions the state's policy of entrusting sand quarrying to the Public Works Department and the rules and regulations surrounding sand quarrying. The court received petitions alleging illegal and indiscriminate sand quarrying in Tholappanpannai and other areas, leading to the appointment of a commission to investigate the extent of quarrying and its impact on the river ecosystem. The commission found that quarrying had altered the ecosystem and recommended remedial measures. The court also refers to relevant provisions of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules regarding sand quarrying.

The court order discusses the issue of sand quarrying in the Tamiraparani river in Tamil Nadu. The Public Works Department has been given the task of operating sand quarries in the state, but there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that quarrying is done in a skilful, scientific, and systematic manner while preserving the environment and ecology of the area. However, there have been allegations of illegal sand quarrying using machinery, which has affected the flow of water and led to a lowering of water tables. The court has ordered a monitoring committee to be constituted to oversee sand quarrying and ensure that it is done in a sustainable manner.

The court order discusses the illegal sand mining activities in five different sites along the Tamiraparani river in Tamil Nadu. The mining activities have caused hydraulic disconnectivity between the river channel and floodplain, created avulsion, and excavated pits below the water table. The mining has also affected the natural river system and altered the ecosystem. The court has ordered a ban on sand and gravel mining/quarrying for five years in all five sites due to the ecological imbalance created by sand mining and the need for the river system to restore. The court has also ordered scientific studies of the entire river system and the prevention of mining near the bank, bridges, road, filter points, etc. Mechanized quarrying is not allowed, and monitory quarrying must be done.

The court order prohibits further sand mining in five sites due to the long-term ecological damage caused by previous quarrying. The experts recommend that if sand mining is to continue in the future, it must be done in a controlled and monitored manner, without the use of heavy machinery. The court notes that excessive sand mining has led to the degradation of rivers, lowered water tables, and environmental problems. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and protection of natural resources for the public good and intergenerational equity. The court also highlights the importance of maintaining the dynamics of the river while allowing sand quarrying.

The court order discusses the issue of sand and gravel mining in Tamil Nadu's Tamiraparani River. The court cites various Supreme Court decisions emphasizing the importance of conserving natural resources and balancing environmental protection with developmental activities. The court also refers to the public trust doctrine, which holds that natural resources are meant for the present and future generations and that the government acts as a trustee for the future generation. The court ultimately accepts the report of Dr. Arunachalam, which recommends a ban on sand and gravel mining for the next five years due to the ecological imbalance caused by excessive mining.

The court order prohibits sand mining/quarrying in the Tamiraparani river for five years due to excessive and illegal sand quarrying that has caused ecological imbalance. The court also orders the rehabilitation of the river and the formation of a monitoring committee for all rivers in Tamil Nadu to ensure scientific sand quarrying in accordance with TN MMC Rules. The court directs the Public Works Department to conduct quarrying operations directly and prohibits the use of heavy machinery. The loading contractors can only load sand on the direction of PWD authorities, and their registration number and name of the lorry driver must be mentioned in the receipt issued by the authorities. The court also constitutes a State Level Monitoring Committee for river sand and other sand quarrying.

The court order establishes a Committee to monitor sand quarrying in Tamil Nadu for a period of two years. The Committee will have offices in four cities and will be provided with necessary infrastructure, including police protection. The Committee will ensure that sand quarrying is done in compliance with regulations and will investigate complaints of illegal or excessive quarrying. The Registrar Judicial will finalize the Committee's members, including retired District Judges and experts in Water Resource Management and Environmentalists. The case will be listed for further orders on December 20, 2010.
