On March 6, 2019, the Delhi High Court heard various applications related to the M.C. Mehta vs Union of India case. The case has been ongoing for several years and involves issues related to air pollution in Delhi. The court heard requests for directions and stays on behalf of various gas distribution companies. Several lawyers represented both the petitioner and the respondents.

In a significant ruling, the court ordered the Delhi government to contribute Rs. 265 crores from the Environment Compensation Charge (ECC) Fund within 10 days for the construction of the Delhi-Meerut Corridor. The government of NCT of Delhi is legally and constitutionally bound to make available the money and to make budgetary allocation for the corridor. The Delhi-Meerut Corridor is a 96 km long stretch of road that will connect Delhi with Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. The project is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and improving connectivity between the two cities.

The court also ordered a joint meeting to prepare a parking plan for providing both residential and commercial parking. The aim is to find out what kind of parking can ease out various problems caused by haphazard parking. The court has been concerned about the issue of parking in Delhi for some time now. The city has been grappling with the problem of haphazard parking for years, which has led to traffic congestion and accidents. The court has directed the authorities to come up with a comprehensive plan to address the issue.

In another ruling, the court directed the Registry to release a sum of Rs. 1,52,80,375/- towards additional subsidy amount payable to the SC/ST bus operators for the conversion of diesel buses/taxis to CNG. The court has been pushing for the conversion of diesel vehicles to CNG in order to reduce air pollution in the city. The court has also ordered Haryana City Gas Distribution Ltd. to furnish certain information to Deloitte within seven days for the valuation of assets.

The court order also lists a case for consideration on April 2, 2019, with the names of two court officials mentioned. The details of the case are not clear from the order.

Overall, the court order reflects the ongoing efforts of the Delhi High Court to address the issue of air pollution in the city. The court has been taking a proactive approach to the issue, directing various authorities to take action to reduce pollution levels. The court has also been concerned about other issues related to urban planning, such as traffic congestion and parking. The court's rulings reflect its commitment to improving the quality of life for the citizens of Delhi.
