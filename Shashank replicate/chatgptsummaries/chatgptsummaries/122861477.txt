The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Sri N Chandrappa against the Member Secretary and Chief Environment Officer of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and Sri A R Shashikumar. The petitioner had sought to quash an order passed by the Appellate Authority and continue the earlier interim orders. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it would not be proper to interfere at the interlocutory stage and that the petitioner could file an appeal under Section 31(B) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 if aggrieved by any order passed by the Appellate Authority.

The case pertains to an ongoing dispute between the petitioner and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board regarding the operation of a stone crushing unit. The petitioner had obtained an interim order from the court allowing him to operate the unit, but the Pollution Control Board had challenged this order before the Appellate Authority. The Appellate Authority had subsequently passed an order directing the petitioner to stop the operation of the unit and pay a penalty for violating pollution control norms.

The petitioner had then filed the writ petition before the High Court seeking to quash the Appellate Authority's order and continue the earlier interim orders. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it would not be proper to interfere at the interlocutory stage. The court observed that the Appellate Authority's order was not a final order and that the petitioner could file an appeal under Section 31(B) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 if aggrieved by any order passed by the Appellate Authority.

Section 31(B) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 provides for an appeal to the National Green Tribunal against any order passed by the Appellate Authority. The court noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under this provision and that it would not be proper to interfere with the Appellate Authority's order at the interlocutory stage.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. It also underscores the need for strict compliance with pollution control norms to protect the environment and public health. The case serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to adhere to the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and other environmental laws to ensure sustainable development and a healthy environment for all.
