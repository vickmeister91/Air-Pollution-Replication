The Supreme Court of India recently heard appeals from Mantri Technoze Pvt. Ltd. and other entities against a judgment and order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The original application was filed by Forward Foundation and others, alleging that ecologically sensitive land was allotted to Mantri Technoze for development projects that violated environmental regulations. The court found that the project had caused damage to the environment and violated regulations, including encroaching on Rajakaluves and wetlands. The court upheld the order for a buffer/green zone around lakes and Rajakaluves and directed the parties to comply with environmental regulations.

The court order discusses a case where constructions have caused damage to the ecology and environment by jeopardizing the ecological balance in a sensitive area. The applicants rely on the Revised Master Plan, 2013, which provides for buffer zones around lakes and Rajakaluves. The construction of the projects is bound to create water scarcity and damage the environment, resulting in a change in the topography of the area, posing a potential threat of extinction of the Bellandur lake, causing traffic congestion, shortening and wiping out the wetlands, extinction of Rajakaluves, and causing serious and potential threat of flooding and massive scarcity of water in the city of Bangalore. The court orders the constitution of a committee to inspect the projects and submit a report on the interconnectivity of lakes and the impact of such activities upon the water bodies, with particular reference to lakes.

The court order directs a committee to examine the impact of construction projects on lakes and wetlands, specifically Bellandur Lake and Agara Lake, and to report on any adverse environmental effects. The committee is also tasked with determining if any projects have violated environmental clearance orders and recommending measures for restoring the ecology of the area. The order also imposes penalties on two respondents for non-compliance with environmental laws and directs the demolition of offending constructions within a buffer zone around water bodies. The order sets specific distances for the buffer zone and directs all authorities to carry out the demolition and restoration operations. The order also addresses the treatment of sewage and the use of treated water for construction purposes.

The court order pertains to the supply of potable water for residential and commercial projects. The order includes directions for the consideration of water requirements during the construction and operation phases, the use of treated sewage water for construction, and the restoration of reclaimed lake areas. The order also imposes environmental compensation on the project proponents and directs the SEIAA to issue an amended order granting environmental clearance. The order further directs the State of Karnataka to submit a proposal for demarcating wetlands and requires the removal of debris and construction material from wetlands. The order also addresses discrepancies in land measurement and requires the submission of an appropriate plan by the project proponents.

The court order discusses the appeal filed against the National Green Tribunal's order regarding the construction activities around Bellandur lake in Bengaluru. The court finds that the application was not maintainable as the statutory decisions and clearances were not challenged before the Tribunal. The court also finds that the application was barred by limitation as it was filed much beyond the prescribed period of limitation. The court further discusses the scope of appeal under Section 22 and states that the appellants cannot seek to re-argue their entire case to seek wholesale re-appreciation of evidence and the factual matrix that has been considered by the Tribunal.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in relation to environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. The court emphasizes that the NGT has broad restorative powers under Section 15(1)(c) of the NGT Act and Section 20 of the Act, and that the existence of the Tribunal without these powers would render it ineffective. The court also clarifies that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal flows independently from Sections 14 and 15 of the Act, and that the Tribunal has overriding powers over anything inconsistent contained in other laws or instruments. The court also addresses the issue of time limitation for filing applications before the Tribunal and concludes that the present application is not barred by time. Finally, the court discusses the specific case before it, where the project proponents have committed breaches and the implementation of the project is bound to have serious adverse impact on the ecology, hydrology, and environment in the catchment area of Bellandur Lake.

The court order discusses the liability of respondents 9 and 10 for environmental damage caused by their construction activities, as they knowingly violated certain conditions in the order granting Environmental Clearance. The court upholds the penalty imposed on them and dismisses their appeal. The court also addresses the issue of res judicata raised by the appellant and concludes that it does not apply. The court sets aside a portion of the order related to distance from water bodies, except for the direction against respondents 9 and 10. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the violation of environmental regulations and damage caused to the ecology and environment due to construction activities in sensitive areas. The court directs the constitution of a committee to examine the impact of construction projects on lakes and wetlands, imposes penalties on non-compliant parties, and sets specific distances for buffer zones around water bodies. The court also addresses the treatment of sewage and the use of treated water for construction purposes, and requires the submission of appropriate plans by project proponents. The court clarifies the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal and upholds penalties imposed on
