The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to the rights of the accused in criminal cases to access documents and statements collected by the prosecution during investigation. 

In the first case, the petitioners sought to set aside an order passed by the XI Additional Sessions Judge in Chennai and direct the prosecution to produce original complaints filed by the de-facto complainant for obtaining certified copies of the same or at least for an inspection of the same. The trial court had dismissed the petition, stating that it was filed without any bona fide and was only meant to protract the disposal of the case. The petitioners argued that the right of the accused to receive the 'Documents/statements' submitted before the court is absolute and it must be adhered to by the complainant. They also cited various judgments to support their argument that the court has a duty to ensure the supply of 'Documents/statements' to the accused in accordance with law.

The court ultimately ordered that the accused be allowed to inspect certain documents and that they pay a sum of money to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority. The court also noted that the dismissal of the petition does not prevent the accused from raising factual and legal pleas during the trial.

In the second case, the court order discussed the rights of the accused to claim copies of documents and statements collected by the prosecution during investigation. The court stated that non-disclosure of such documents would affect the administration of criminal justice and the defense of the accused. The court also discussed the examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the importance of allowing the accused access to relevant documents.
