The court order in question pertains to a revision under Section 115, Civil P.C., against an order passed by the Munsif of Shahganj in execution proceedings. The case involves an ex parte decree obtained by the appellant Brij Mohan Das against the opposite party, Mt. Piari, for a sum of Rs. 550 in a suit that could be instituted in either Benares or Jaunpur, with the plaintiff having the choice of forum. The judgment-debtor resides in Jaunpur District, and the decree-holder obtained a certificate of transfer of the decree for execution in Jaunpur.

However, when the decree-holder applied to the Court at Jaunpur for execution of the decree, the judgment-debtor objected on the ground that the Court which passed the decree sought to be executed had no jurisdiction, as he (the judgment-debtor) was an agriculturist and the suit against him could be instituted only in the District in which he resided. The Court executing the decree gave effect to this objection, holding that the Benares Court had no jurisdiction to pass the decree under execution.

The appellant challenged this decision, arguing that the Court executing the decree had no power to question the validity of the decree which it was called upon to execute. The High Court agreed with the appellant, holding that the order of the lower Court cannot be supported.

The Court noted that the question of jurisdiction had already been decided by the Court that passed the decree, and that the judgment-debtor had not challenged the jurisdiction of that Court at the time of the original suit. Therefore, the Court executing the decree had no power to question the jurisdiction of the Court that passed the decree.

The Court also noted that the judgment-debtor had not raised any objection to the transfer of the decree for execution in Jaunpur, and that the Court at Jaunpur had no power to go behind the certificate of transfer issued by the Court at Benares.

In conclusion, the Court held that the order of the lower Court was erroneous and set it aside. The Court also directed the Court at Jaunpur to proceed with the execution of the decree in accordance with law.

This case highlights the importance of challenging jurisdiction at the appropriate time and the limits of the power of the Court executing a decree. It also underscores the need for careful consideration of the choice of forum in cases where multiple forums are available.
