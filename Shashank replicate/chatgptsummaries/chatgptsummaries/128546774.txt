The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) filed a review application against an order that observed that the applicant, who had previously appeared on behalf of the DDA, should not have appeared on behalf of the respondents in a different case. The case involved the allotment of alternative sites to marble traders who had been removed from their place of business. The court had previously directed the DDA to allot alternative plots to the respondents, and the applicant had contested this plea on behalf of the DDA in an earlier writ petition. The applicant sought a review of the order, arguing that the issues involved in the two writ petitions were different and that there were no rules preventing a counsel from appearing for opposite parties in different litigations. The applicant also argued that derogatory remarks should not be made against counsel without hearing them.

The court order discusses a case where a lawyer was not given notice before the court made negative remarks about his conduct. The court found that the lawyer had represented both sides in a case and had not justified his actions. The court also discussed previous cases where negative remarks were made against individuals or authorities and emphasized the importance of giving them an opportunity to defend themselves and ensuring that the remarks are necessary for the decision of the case. Ultimately, the court did not recall or review the negative remarks made against the lawyer in this case.

The court order discusses the considerations that should be taken into account when making remarks about a party's conduct in court. It also cites a breach of professional conduct by an advocate who switched sides in a case. The court concludes that there are no grounds to recall or review the observations made about the advocate's conduct in the case.
