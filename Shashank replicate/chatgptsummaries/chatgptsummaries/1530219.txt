In a recent court order, the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board was ordered to pay compensation to the dependents of a man who died from electrocution caused by a live wire on the road. The Board had argued that the wire was illegally siphoned by a third party and that they were not liable for damages. However, the court ruled that the Board had a duty to prevent such mishaps and that the doctrine of strict liability applied, making them liable for compensation.

The case was brought before the court by the dependents of the deceased, who had died due to electrocution caused by a live wire on the road. The dependents had argued that the Board was responsible for the incident and that they should be held liable for compensation. The Board, on the other hand, had argued that the wire was illegally siphoned by a third party and that they were not liable for damages.

The court, after hearing both sides, ruled in favor of the dependents. The court held that the Board had a duty to prevent such mishaps and that the doctrine of strict liability applied in this case. The court further held that the Board could not escape liability by arguing that the wire was illegally siphoned by a third party.

The doctrine of strict liability is a legal principle that holds a party responsible for damages caused by their actions or products, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. In this case, the court held that the Board was strictly liable for the damages caused by the live wire on the road.

The court also dismissed the Board's appeal and ordered them to pay the compensation without issuing notice to the respondents. This means that the Board will have to pay the compensation to the dependents of the deceased without any further delay.

This court order is significant as it highlights the importance of the doctrine of strict liability in cases where a party is responsible for damages caused by their actions or products. It also emphasizes the duty of the Board to prevent such mishaps and to ensure the safety of the public.
