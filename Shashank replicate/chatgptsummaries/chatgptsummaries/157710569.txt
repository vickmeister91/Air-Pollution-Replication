The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently received a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the IInd Additional Sessions Judge and the SDM in Criminal Case No. 02/133/2002. The petitioners were accused of running a plastic industry that caused pollution and health problems to citizens nearby. The SDM had earlier passed an order to close the industries, but the petitioners continued to run them. 

The court allowed the petition and set aside the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the SDM. The respondents were advised to approach the Green Tribunal if there was public nuisance. This decision was made after considering the arguments presented by both parties and examining the evidence presented before the court.

The petitioners had argued that the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the SDM were arbitrary and without any legal basis. They contended that the industries were not causing any pollution and that the allegations against them were baseless. They also argued that the orders were passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

On the other hand, the respondents argued that the industries were causing pollution and health problems to the citizens nearby. They presented evidence to support their claims and argued that the orders passed by the SDM were necessary to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.

After examining the evidence presented by both parties, the court found that the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the SDM were not based on any legal provisions. The court also found that the petitioners were not given an opportunity to be heard before the orders were passed. Therefore, the court set aside the orders and allowed the petition.

The court also advised the respondents to approach the Green Tribunal if there was public nuisance. This decision was made in accordance with the principles of environmental law, which require that any action taken to protect the environment must be based on sound legal principles and must be taken after giving an opportunity to be heard to all parties concerned.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court set aside the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the SDM in Criminal Case No. 02/133/2002. The court allowed the petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and advised the respondents to approach the Green Tribunal if there was public nuisance. This decision was made after considering the arguments presented by both parties and examining the evidence presented before the court.
