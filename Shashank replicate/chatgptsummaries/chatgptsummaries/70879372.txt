The court order pertains to two separate cases involving economic offences and the Proceeds of Crime. In the first case, Mohammad Iqbal filed a criminal revision case against the State of U.P. and another party. The revisionist challenged an order passed by the Special Judge, PMLA/Sessions Judge, Lucknow in Complaint Case No. 4 of 2015 (Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement Vs. Mohd. Iqbal), under Section 3/4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The case relates to the alleged generation of "Proceeds of Crime" amounting to Rs. 52,42,525/- by the revisionist and his firm out of the commission of Scheduled Offence. The revisionist's counsel argued that the alleged amount of Rs. 2 lac, which was in lieu of a chimney, cannot be said to be "Proceed of Crime" as it was not obtained by doing a Scheduled Offence. The court heard both sides and reserved its judgment.

In the second case, the court sets aside the previous order and remands the matter back to the lower court to consider the observations made by the court. The court notes that the cost of the unit, which was not installed at the factory, is treated as a 'Proceed of Crime'. The court also mentions that the court below failed to consider this aspect of the matter.

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to prevent money-laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money-laundering. The Act defines "Proceeds of Crime" as any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a Scheduled Offence.

The Scheduled Offences are listed in the Schedule to the Act and include offences under various laws such as the Indian Penal Code, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Prevention of Corruption Act, and the Foreign Exchange Management Act, among others.
