The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by the petitioner, seeking relief against certain environmental violations. The petitioner's counsel informed the court that the Green Tribunal Act, 2010 has come into effect and the Tribunal has started functioning in Delhi. The court order states that if any remedy is available under the said Act, the petitioner may withdraw the writ petition.

The Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the constitution of a National Green Tribunal and several Regional Benches, which have jurisdiction over different parts of the country.

The court order suggests that the petitioner may have a remedy available under the Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which would be more appropriate than pursuing the writ petition. The Act provides for a specialized forum for the resolution of environmental disputes, which is better equipped to deal with such matters than a regular court.

The court has postponed the matter to 28th July 2011, presumably to allow the petitioner to explore the possibility of seeking relief under the Green Tribunal Act, 2010. It is unclear from the court order whether the petitioner has decided to withdraw the writ petition or whether the matter will be pursued further.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of the Green Tribunal Act, 2010 in providing a specialized forum for the resolution of environmental disputes. It also underscores the need for litigants to be aware of the remedies available under the Act and to pursue them where appropriate.
