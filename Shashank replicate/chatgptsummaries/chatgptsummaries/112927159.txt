The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by two individuals who were arrested for an offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that the applicants fenced their field with a high-tension wire, which resulted in the death of an elephant. The applicants deny the allegations and claim that the land belongs to someone else.

After perusing the case diary and documents, the court granted bail to the applicants on the grounds that they have been in jail since January 2017 and the charge sheet has been filed. The applicants were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety for their appearance in court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the applicants were accused of violating the provisions of the Act by fencing their field with a high-tension wire, which resulted in the death of an elephant. The prosecution alleged that the applicants were aware of the presence of the elephant in the area and deliberately erected the fence to trap and kill the animal.

The applicants, on the other hand, denied the allegations and claimed that the land belonged to someone else. They argued that they had no knowledge of the presence of the elephant in the area and that they had erected the fence to protect their crops from wild animals.

The court, after perusing the case diary and documents, found that there was no direct evidence to suggest that the applicants had deliberately erected the fence to trap and kill the elephant. The court also noted that the applicants had been in jail since January 2017 and that the charge sheet had been filed.

Taking into account these factors, the court granted bail to the applicants. The court directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety for their appearance in court. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicants, such as not leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and not tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by two individuals who were arrested for an offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court, after perusing the case diary and documents, granted bail to the applicants on the grounds that they have been in jail since January 2017 and the charge sheet has been filed. The applicants were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety for their appearance in court. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicants, such as not leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and not tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses.
