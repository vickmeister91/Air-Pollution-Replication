The court order pertains to two separate cases involving construction work and building permits. In the first case, M/S. Safe Homes Developers filed a writ petition against the Kannur Municipality challenging the stop memo issued by the local authority and seeking to continue construction work. The court examined the permits and orders issued by the municipality and the government and found that the petitioners had obtained all necessary licenses and permissions for construction. The court also noted that the stop memos issued by the municipality did not provide any specific reason for the suspension of construction work. As a result, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners and allowed them to continue construction.

In the second case, a building permit was granted in 2008 for the construction of a multi-storied complex. However, in 2012, the government issued a stop memo citing violations of construction rules and CRZ norms. The court found that the government's materials were not satisfactory to invoke such a drastic step and quashed the stop memo. The court reserved the right of the Secretary of Municipality to take proper action after issuing notice to the petitioners and after hearing them and any other interested parties.

In both cases, the court carefully examined the permits and orders issued by the municipality and the government and found that the petitioners had obtained all necessary licenses and permissions for construction. The court also noted that the stop memos issued by the municipality and the government did not provide any specific reason for the suspension of construction work. As a result, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners and allowed them to continue construction.

This court order highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary licenses and permissions for construction work. It also emphasizes the need for local authorities and the government to provide specific reasons for the suspension of construction work. The court's decision in these cases ensures that construction work can continue without unnecessary delays or interruptions, while also ensuring that all necessary regulations and norms are followed.
