The Bombay High Court recently heard a case involving a cooperative processors society that employed more than 20 people and used electric power to treat effluent water before discharging it into the river basin. The question before the court was whether the use of electric power for processing effluent water could be considered a manufacturing process under the Employees' State Insurance Act.

The court examined various definitions and previous cases to determine whether the use of power was an integral part of the manufacturing process. Ultimately, the court found that the treatment of effluent water was not part of the manufacturing process and therefore the cooperative society was not covered under the Employees' State Insurance Act.

The court order stated that a society engaged in bleaching, dyeing, and mercerizing of grey-cloth was using power for treating effluent before discharging it into the Krishna River basin. The treatment of water was not a part of the manufacturing process and was required by the Pollution Act. The court held that there was no nexus between the manufacturing activity and the treatment of effluent, and therefore, the use of power was not for any manufacturing process of the society's factory.

The appeal was dismissed, and parties were left to bear their own costs.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the definition of manufacturing processes under the Employees' State Insurance Act. The Act provides for certain benefits to employees of factories or establishments engaged in manufacturing processes. However, the Act does not cover establishments engaged in activities that are not considered manufacturing processes.

In this case, the court found that the treatment of effluent water was not an integral part of the manufacturing process and therefore the cooperative society was not covered under the Act. The court's decision was based on the fact that the treatment of effluent water was required by the Pollution Act and was not directly related to the manufacturing process.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the scope of the Employees' State Insurance Act and provides guidance to establishments engaged in activities that may not be considered manufacturing processes. The decision also highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and ensuring that effluent water is treated before being discharged into the river basin.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance to establishments engaged in activities that may not be considered manufacturing processes under the Employees' State Insurance Act. The decision underscores the importance of complying with environmental regulations and ensuring that effluent water is treated before being discharged into the river basin.
