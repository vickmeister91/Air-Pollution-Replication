The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Mehtap Singh under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence punishable under sections 2, 9, 39, 50 & 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The allegation against the applicant is that he, along with other co-accused, has been found in possession of body parts of a wild life animal Black Buck (Kala Hiran).

After considering the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defence, the court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant is innocent, a first offender, and no other case for a similar nature of offence has been registered against him. The court also took into account the fact that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time.

However, the court did not grant the bail unconditionally. The applicant has to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- with two local solvent sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial. The court also listed eight conditions that the applicant has to comply with, failing which the bail will be cancelled.

The first condition is that the applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer. The second condition is that the applicant shall not leave India without the prior permission of the court. The third condition is that the applicant shall surrender his passport, if any, to the court. The fourth condition is that the applicant shall not tamper with the evidence or attempt to influence or intimidate the witnesses. The fifth condition is that the applicant shall attend the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial. The sixth condition is that the applicant shall not commit any offence while on bail. The seventh condition is that the applicant shall report to the investigating officer as and when required by him. The eighth and final condition is that the applicant shall not change his residence without the prior permission of the court.

The court order makes it clear that the bail has been granted on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case and the personal circumstances of the applicant. The court has also taken into account the fact that the offence in question is bailable and that the applicant has no previous criminal record.

It is important to note that the grant of bail does not mean that the applicant has been acquitted of the charges against him. The trial will continue and the applicant will have to prove his innocence before the court. The conditions imposed by the court are meant to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or tamper with the evidence and that he attends the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a bail application filed by Mehtap Singh under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence punishable under sections 2, 9, 39, 50 & 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant is innocent, a first offender, and no other case for a similar nature of offence has been registered against him. However, the bail has been granted subject to certain conditions that the applicant has to comply with, failing which the bail will be cancelled. The trial will continue and the applicant will have to prove his innocence before the court.
