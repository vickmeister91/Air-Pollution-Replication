The case in question involves a petitioner who filed a petition to challenge the order of the trial court that declined his request to re-evaluate the gold he had pawned with the bank. The trial court rejected the request on the grounds that there is no provision for re-evaluation of gold under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner, however, was not satisfied with this decision and sought relief from the High Court.

The High Court, after hearing the petitioner's arguments, issued directions for the appointment of a Senior Member of the Bar as Local Commissioner to take the gold articles for valuation. The charges for this valuation were to be paid by the petitioner. The report of the Goldsmith after valuation shall be final and the petitioner shall raise no objection to the veracity of the same.

The petitioner's argument was that the trial court had erred in not allowing him to re-evaluate the gold he had pawned with the bank. He argued that the gold had been undervalued and that he had suffered a loss as a result. The trial court, however, had rejected this argument on the grounds that there is no provision for re-evaluation of gold under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

The High Court, in its order, noted that while there is no provision for re-evaluation of gold under Section 91 Cr.P.C., there is also no provision that prohibits such re-evaluation. The court further noted that the petitioner had a right to seek relief if he believed that the gold had been undervalued.

The court, therefore, directed the appointment of a Senior Member of the Bar as Local Commissioner to take the gold articles for valuation. The charges for this valuation were to be paid by the petitioner. The report of the Goldsmith after valuation shall be final and the petitioner shall raise no objection to the veracity of the same.

The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the right of a petitioner to seek relief if he believes that the gold he has pawned has been undervalued. The court's decision also ensures that the petitioner is not unfairly burdened with the charges for the valuation of the gold.

In conclusion, the High Court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the law relating to the valuation of gold. The court's decision recognizes the right of a petitioner to seek relief if he believes that the gold he has pawned has been undervalued. The court's decision also ensures that the petitioner is not unfairly burdened with the charges for the valuation of the gold.
