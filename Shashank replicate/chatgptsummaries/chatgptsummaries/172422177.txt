The reason for this stay is not clear from the court order, but it is likely that the court wants to give both sides an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence before making a decision.

Overall, the court order in this case is significant because it highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the role of regulatory bodies in enforcing these regulations. The court's decision to direct the petitioner's counsel to submit two copies of the writ application to the Jharkhand Pollution Control Board indicates that the Board will play a role in determining the outcome of this case.
