The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri James Prasad Naronha and Sri Francis Praveen Pinto against the State of Karnataka and Forest Department officials. The petitioners sought to quash a notification issued by the Forest Department in 1994, which declared their properties as reserved forest land. The petitioners claimed ownership of the land, which was originally granted to the grandfather of petitioner No.2 in 1959. The respondents argued that the land was reserved forest and that the grant made in favour of the grandfather was liable to be cancelled.

The court noted that the grant could only be cancelled after following due procedure and that the respondents had not issued notice to the original owners of the land. The court ordered further investigation into the matter. The court also stated that the government cannot issue preliminary and final notifications for properties in question unless they have issued notice to the original owners of the properties. The respondents have not provided evidence of issuing such notice, and therefore the notifications issued by the government cannot be sustained.

The court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the impugned notification, with liberty to the respondents to issue notice and provide an opportunity to the petitioners before passing appropriate orders. This means that the Forest Department's notification declaring the petitioners' properties as reserved forest land has been cancelled, and the petitioners' claim of ownership over the land has been upheld.

The court's decision is based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties be given a fair opportunity to present their case before a decision is made. In this case, the court found that the Forest Department had not followed due procedure in cancelling the grant made in favour of the petitioners' grandfather, and had not issued notice to the original owners of the land before declaring it as reserved forest land.

The court's order has significant implications for the Forest Department's land acquisition policies. It sets a precedent that the government cannot acquire private land without following due procedure and issuing notice to the original owners of the land. This will help protect the rights of landowners and prevent arbitrary acquisition of land by the government.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the petitioners and for the principle of natural justice. It upholds the petitioners' claim of ownership over their land and sets a precedent for fair and transparent land acquisition policies by the government.
