In a writ petition filed by M/s Sri Jyothi Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents, the court order pertains to the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought to quash the notice and direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the stone crushing units. The court found that the petitioner was a licensee and the licenses were valid to run the stone crushing units. The court also noted that a similar writ action had been considered by a Division Bench of the court, and therefore, the court followed the decision of the Division Bench.

The court quashed the closure notices and allowed the petitioner to operate the stone crushing units at the present site till such time its applications were considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. This decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had valid licenses to operate the stone crushing units and that the closure notice was not justified.

The court's decision was significant as it upheld the rights of licensees to operate their businesses without undue interference from regulatory authorities. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of following established legal precedents in deciding cases.
