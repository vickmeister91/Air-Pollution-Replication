The Madras High Court issued a court order on June 28, 2018, regarding a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner, I.H. Sekar, sought to call for records related to the transfer of land in S.No.707/2 and S.No.707/3 to various government departments and to quash the transfer. The court ordered the third respondent to restore, protect, and preserve the "Back Water (Kazhuveli) lands" along the sides of Buckingham Canal in the Revenue District of Kancheepuram. The order was pronounced on April 29, 2019, by Justice M. Venugopal and Justice S. Vaidyanathan.

The court order discusses a writ petition filed as a public interest litigation seeking to quash two government orders that transferred land classified as "Backwater (Kazhuveli) lands" to government departments for construction purposes. The petitioner argues that these lands are important for mitigating floods, storing excess water, and recharging wells and ponds. The court notes that the National Green Tribunal has reserved judgment on a related application to restrain construction activities on the Kazhuveli lands.

The petitioner seeks to quash two orders transferring Kazhuveli lands to respondents 5 and 6 for construction of buildings, claiming that it violates the protection of water bodies, wetlands, and water areas. The petitioner argues that the lands act as buffer storages of excess water during rains and are home to flora and fauna, and any construction activities would cause permanent damages and destructions. The petitioner also claims that the respondents have taken a strange and fallacious stand before the NGT that Kazhuveli lands do not come under the category of water areas/wetlands/marshlands and hence do not enjoy any protection against re-classification, alienation, or transfers for alternate uses.

The petitioner challenged two government orders that allowed reclassification and alienation of Kazhuveli lands, arguing that it violated Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which recognizes the right to water as part of the right to life. The third respondent argued that the issue had already been dealt with by the NGT and that the lands transferred to the departments were not directly connected to the sea or Pallikaranai Marsh. They also stated that declaring all low-lying lands as marsh lands or water bodies would create confusion and affect sustainable development. The NGT had already held that the disputed land in S.No.707 was not a water body or marsh land and that the 7 acres of land transferred to the 5th respondent Transport Department was for public purpose and construction.

The court order discusses a petition challenging the transfer of Kazhuveli lands to the 5th and 6th respondents. The petitioner argues that the order passed by the NGT in a previous application does not constitute a legal bar against the present writ petition. The petitioner also argues that the claim of res judicata raised by the 3rd respondent is unsustainable. The court notes that the NGT lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity of the transfer of wetlands by state authorities, which come under the ambit of Public Trust Doctrine. The court also notes that the subject lands may be wetlands, but they were not notified wetlands under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010, and therefore, no protection can be claimed under the said rule.

The court order discusses the transfer of Kazhuveli lands and whether they are classified as Marsh Lands under the Wetland Rules, 2017. The petitioner argues that the transfer violates the Principle of “Public Trust Doctrine” and the Responsibilities of the State in protecting natural and communal properties. The court cites several judgments, including the ancient Roman Empire's "Doctrine of the Public Trust" and the English common law's concept of property rights in rivers, the sea, and the seashore. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters, and forests have such great importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership.

The court order deals with the Mysore Slum (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1958 and states that there is nothing in the Act which excludes the principles of natural justice. The court issues directions for the State to follow the provisions of the Act and protect water bodies. The State is also directed to ensure that alienation of tank poramboke lands citing public interest shall not be made under Section 12 of the Act. The court upholds the Act while providing for observance of principles of natural justice within the Act itself. The order also includes arguments made by the petitioner and the response of the Learned Additional Advocate General.

The court order discusses the classification of lands assigned to Respondents 5 and 6 as wetlands or marsh lands. The Learned Additional Advocate General argues that the lands are not marsh lands and fall within an unobjectionable category suitable for assignment. The court cites previous judgments and emphasizes that environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has no concern with the present issue, and it is for the State Government to take necessary action. The petitioner argues that the transfer of land to Respondents 5 and 6 will be prejudicial
