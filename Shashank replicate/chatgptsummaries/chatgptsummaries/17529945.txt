The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the applicants were accused of spreading electricity in a forest area, which resulted in the death of a tiger.

If the applicants fail to comply with the court's directions, the order may become ineffective, and they may be arrested again.
