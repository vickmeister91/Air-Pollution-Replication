The High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad issued a court order in a case between Dhangadhra Prakruti Mandal and the Union of India and four other respondents. The petitioner, a registered society concerned about the environment and ecosystem in the little rann of Kutch, filed a petition against respondent no.5 and its manufacturing activity. The petitioner claimed that respondent no.5, a company, had not obtained necessary environment clearance under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification dated 27.01.1994 and was manufacturing ductile iron spun pipes and cast iron spun pipes without such clearance. The petitioner prayed for various reliefs, including directing the respondent nos.1 to 4 to suspend all activities of the respondent no.5 pertaining to the manufacture and/or production of the Ductile iron Spun Pipes and Cast Iron Spun Pipes in the Plant of Ductile Iron Spun Pipes and Cast Iron Pipes of the respondent no.5 situated at Mundra in Kutch district of Gujarat State.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and examined the record of the case. The court order denies that the production of ductile iron pipes requires environmental clearance and that the manufacturing of ductile iron pipes by SPL/JSL is not in violation of any substantive law. The court also refers to an earlier judgment where the issue of whether the manufacturing activity in the plant at the site in question amounted to foundry work was addressed and considered. The Division Bench had directed the ministry to seek clarification from the Expert Committee and had directed the Pollution Control Board not to grant consent to operate for DI Pipe Fittings and DI Castings. The respondent no.1 has then obtained clarification from the Expert Committee. The court also notes an expert opinion by Dr.K.K. Mishra, Emeritus Scientist, National Metallurgical Laboratory, CSIR, Jamshedpur, who states that the manufacture of spun pipe is not a typical foundry operation in a strict sense.

The court order discusses the classification of a manufacturing unit that produces centrifugally spun CI and GI pipes. The court refers to an earlier judgment and an opinion by an expert committee that concluded that such a unit cannot be classified as a foundry unit. The court also notes that the unit does not manufacture ductile iron pipe fittings and castings. Based on this, the court concludes that there is no justification to grant the relief sought by the petitioner to suspend the activities of the unit. The court directs the authorities to check the manufacturing activities and products of the unit and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The court also directs the authorities to examine the environmental aspects of the disposals referred to by an expert and stipulate necessary conditions for compliance.

The court order discharges the rule subject to earlier observations and clarifications. Interim relief is vacated but subject to directions. No costs are awarded. A civil application is disposed of in view of the order passed in the main matter.

In summary, the court order from the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad addressed a petition filed by Dhangadhra Prakruti Mandal against respondent no.5, a company manufacturing ductile iron spun pipes and cast iron spun pipes without necessary environment clearance. The court denied that the production of ductile iron pipes requires environmental clearance and concluded that the manufacturing of ductile iron pipes by SPL/JSL is not in violation of any substantive law. The court also directed the authorities to check the manufacturing activities and products of the unit and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The court order discharges the rule subject to earlier observations and clarifications, and no costs are awarded.
