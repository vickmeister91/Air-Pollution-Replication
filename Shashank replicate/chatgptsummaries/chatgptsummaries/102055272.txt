The case at hand involves an application filed by the applicants under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to quash complaint No. 37/SW/2010 filed in the Court of the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 18th Court, Girgum, and the order dated 5th March 2010 passed therein. The applicant No.1 is the Chairman of NKGSB Cooperative Bank, which has its registered office in Mumbai. The bank was established in 1917 and has 40 branches all over India, with a turnover of Rs 3670 Crores. The bank is a multistate cooperative bank, duly registered under the Multistate Cooperative Societies Act. Respondent No.2 is one of the tenants occupying flat No. 17.

The complaint filed by respondent No.2 alleges that the bank and its officials carried out unauthorized and illegal structural alterations and additions without obtaining mandatory permits. The bank alleges that the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention of extorting money and harassing them. The court hears arguments from both sides and ultimately decides that there is substance in the bank's claims and quashes the complaint and FIR filed by respondent No.2.

The court order states that the complaint filed by respondent No. 2 against the bank and its officers should be quashed. The bank is the landlord of the property, and respondent No. 2 is a tenant. The bank decided to carry out repairs and renovation, but respondent No. 2 filed various complaints against the bank and its officers to various authorities. The matter was settled between the parties on payment of Rs. 27,000 to respondent No. 2, but he later demanded compensation for damages caused by the bank's contractor. The bank made the payment, but respondent No. 2 filed two criminal complaints against the bank and its officers.

The court order discusses two criminal complaints filed by the respondent against bank officers and the Bank AGM. The respondent also lodged complaints with various authorities and sought advice from the Anti-Corruption Bureau. The court must be cautious before quashing a criminal complaint, but in this case, the applicants have made a case for quashing the complaint. The complaint alleges violations of the M.R.T.P. Act, the Environment Protection Act, and the Indian Penal Code, but no complaint has been filed by the Planning Authority or any other authority. Therefore, the court orders the complaint to be quashed.

The court order states that no complaint has been filed against the bank for unauthorized repairs under the M.R.T.P. Act and the Environment Protection Act. The applicants are not personally responsible for the alleged offenses under the Indian Penal Code. The complainant has a history of filing complaints against the bank and has withdrawn them after accepting compensation. The court concludes that the complainant has abused the process of the court for personal gain and quashes the criminal complaint and the order for investigation.

In summary, the court order deals with multiple complaints filed by respondent No. 2 against the bank and its officials. The court quashes the complaint and FIR filed by respondent No. 2, stating that there is substance in the bank's claims that the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention of extorting money and harassing them. The court also orders the complaint to be quashed as no complaint has been filed by the Planning Authority or any other authority. The court concludes that the complainant has abused the process of the court for personal gain and quashes the criminal complaint and the order for investigation.
