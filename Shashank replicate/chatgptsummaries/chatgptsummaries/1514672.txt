The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a motel located in the Kullu-Manali valley in India. The motel had acquired additional land and constructed various structures to protect it from floods. However, the construction work was not done under expert advice, and the relief channel, which is part of the natural flow of the river, was blocked without permission. The court held the motel responsible for interfering with the natural flow of the river and degrading the environment. The court also discussed the public trust doctrine, which holds that certain resources, such as navigable waterways and their shores, are held in trust by the government for the benefit of the public.

In one of the court orders, the court took notice of a news article published in the Indian Express in 1996, which reported that Kamal Nath's family had direct links with a private company that owned the motel. The company had built a club after encroaching upon forest land, which was later regularized and leased out to the company when Kamal Nath was the Minister of Environment and Forests. The club was washed away by the swollen Beas river, and the company was moving bulldozers and earth-movers to turn the course of the river to reclaim the land. The court did not comment on the averment made by Kamal Nath and noted that almost all the shares in the company were owned by his family. The court also referred to the lease deed, which granted the company permission to enter and occupy the land for the purpose of putting up a motel and installing ancillaries. The court did not pass any orders in the matter.

In another court order, the court discussed a series of letters and correspondence between the motel and the government regarding the motel's encroachment on forest land and building of embankments along the river banks. The motel requested to lease the additional land and had received prior approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court order notes that the motel had already built extensive embankments before receiving approval and that the government had limited funds to address erosion. Ultimately, a lease deed was executed between the government and the motel for the additional land.

The court order also includes details of the construction done by the motel prior to the 1995 floods to protect the newly acquired land. After the floods, the motel dredged the left side channel of the river and constructed wire crate revetments to direct the flow through the channel. However, the construction work was not done under expert advice, and the relief channel, which is part of the natural flow of the river, was blocked without permission. The report recommends that no new construction should be allowed in the flood-prone area, and the newly acquired land of the motel should be deleased and taken care of by the Forest Department. The report also suggests that long-term planning for flood control in the Kullu Valley needs to be taken up immediately.

The court held the motel responsible for interfering with the natural flow of the river and degrading the environment. The Public Trust Doctrine imposes restrictions on governmental authority to protect resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court concluded that the plaintiffs can rely on the public trust doctrine to challenge the allocation of water resources in the Mono basin. The court also holds that the state cannot convert natural resources into private ownership or for commercial use without considering the public trust.

The court ordered the cancellation of a lease granted to the motel by the Himachal Pradesh government and directs the government to take over the area and restore it to its original-natural conditions. The motel is also ordered to pay compensation for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area and to construct a boundary wall. The court also discussed the Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays principle as essential features of Sustainable Development.

The court has ordered an assessment of the cost to reverse the environmental damage caused by the motel, and the motel's management must show cause as to why a pollution fine should not be imposed. The motel must construct a boundary wall to separate its building from the river basin and not encroach on the river basin. The motel must not discharge untreated effluent into the river, and the pollution control board will inspect the motel's treatment plants. The pollution control board will also inspect other hotels/institutions/factories in the area and take action if they are discharging untreated effluent/waste into the river. The motel must show cause as to why pollution fines and damages should not be imposed, and NEERI must submit a report by December 17, 1996. The writ petition is disposed of except for the limited purpose indicated above.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of protecting natural resources for public use and enjoyment. The court held the motel responsible for interfering with the natural flow of the river and degrading the environment. The court also discussed the public trust doctrine, which holds that certain resources, such as navigable waterways and their shores, are held in trust by the government for the benefit of the public. The court ordered the cancellation of a lease granted to the motel by the Himachal Pradesh government and directs the government to take over the area and restore it to its original-natural conditions. The court also discussed the Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays principle as essential features of Sustainable Development.
