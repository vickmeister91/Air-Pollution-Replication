The court recently dismissed a criminal revision case filed by V.S. Balsamy against the Inspector of Police, Special Police Establishment, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Anti-Corruption Bureau in Chennai. The case was filed under Section 397 and 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, against an order disallowing a prayer under Section 91 Cr.P.C. in Crl.M.P.No.546/2008 in C.C.No.5/2006 passed by the II Additional District Judge (Special Court for CBI Cases), Coimbatore. The dismissal was due to the case being deemed infructuous.

The case in question was related to a prayer made by Balsamy under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Balsamy had requested the court to issue a summons to the Inspector of Police, Special Police Establishment, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Anti-Corruption Bureau in Chennai, seeking certain documents related to a case that was being investigated by the CBI.

However, the II Additional District Judge (Special Court for CBI Cases), Coimbatore, had disallowed the prayer made by Balsamy, stating that the documents sought by him were not relevant to the case being investigated by the CBI. Balsamy had then filed a criminal revision case against this order, under Section 397 and 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

The case was subsequently transferred to the Madras High Court, where it was dismissed as infructuous. The court held that since the case had been filed against an order disallowing a prayer under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and since the prayer had already been disallowed by the II Additional District Judge (Special Court for CBI Cases), Coimbatore, the case had become infructuous. The court also noted that Balsamy had not challenged the order of the II Additional District Judge (Special Court for CBI Cases) on merits, and therefore, the court could not examine the same.

The dismissal of the case by the Madras High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process of law while seeking documents or other evidence in a criminal case. The court's decision to dismiss the case as infructuous also underscores the need for litigants to carefully consider the merits of their case before filing a revision petition or appeal.

Overall, the dismissal of the criminal revision case filed by V.S. Balsamy against the Inspector of Police, Special Police Establishment, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Anti-Corruption Bureau in Chennai serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to due process of law and carefully considering the merits of a case before filing a petition or appeal.
