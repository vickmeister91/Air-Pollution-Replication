In a recent court order, a case involving a petition for the dissolution of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, between Smt. Shashi Garg and Sh. Arun Garg was transferred to the court's file. The parties had reached an agreement outside of court, which was filed with the court. Upon review, the court found that the agreement satisfied the requirements of Section 13-B of the Act for divorce by mutual consent. As a result, the court granted the decree for divorce and ordered the petitioner to withdraw a petition filed under Section 125 Cr. P.C.

The court also ordered the parties to adhere to the terms of the compromise deed, which would form the decree. It is important to note that no costs were awarded in this case.

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, governs marriages in India and provides for various grounds for divorce, including mutual consent. Section 13-B of the Act lays down the procedure for obtaining a divorce by mutual consent. It requires that both parties must have been living separately for a period of one year or more, and they must have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage.

In this case, it appears that the parties had been living separately for the required period and had reached an agreement outside of court. The court reviewed the agreement and found that it satisfied the requirements of Section 13-B of the Act. As a result, the court granted the decree for divorce.

The court also ordered the petitioner to withdraw a petition filed under Section 125 Cr. P.C. Section 125 Cr. P.C. provides for the payment of maintenance to wives, children, and parents. It is possible that the petitioner had filed a petition under this section seeking maintenance from the respondent. However, since the parties had reached an agreement outside of court, the court ordered the petitioner to withdraw the petition.

Finally, the court ordered the parties to adhere to the terms of the compromise deed, which would form the decree. A compromise deed is a legal document that sets out the terms of a settlement between parties. In this case, the parties had reached an agreement outside of court, which was filed with the court. The court ordered the parties to adhere to the terms of this agreement, which would form the decree for divorce.

It is important to note that no costs were awarded in this case. In legal proceedings, costs refer to the expenses incurred by a party in pursuing or defending a case. In some cases, the court may order one party to pay the costs of the other party. However, in this case, the court did not award any costs.

In conclusion, the recent court order involving Smt. Shashi Garg and Sh. Arun Garg's case for the dissolution of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, highlights the importance of reaching an agreement outside of court. The court found that the parties had satisfied the requirements of Section 13-B of the Act for divorce by mutual consent and granted the decree for divorce. The court also ordered the petitioner to withdraw a petition filed under Section 125 Cr. P.C. and ordered the parties to adhere to the terms of the compromise deed, which would form the decree. No costs were awarded in this case.
