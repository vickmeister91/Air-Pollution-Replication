The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the Kerala Private Forest (Vesting and Assignment) Act. In the first case, the plaintiff filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction claiming ownership of certain properties. The defendants, who were government officials, denied the plaintiff's claims and argued that the suit was not maintainable under the Act. The trial court found in favor of the defendants and dismissed the suit. The plaintiff appealed the decision, but the High Court upheld the trial court's ruling.

In the second case, the plaintiff claimed ownership of a property that was previously exempted from being a private forest under the Act. The lower courts dismissed the plaintiff's suit, stating that the property was part of the vested forest and that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the case. The plaintiff appealed, and the court considered several questions of law, including whether the lower court's decision was sustainable and whether the plaintiff had established that the property claimed was the same as the exempted property. The court ultimately held that the Forest Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide whether the disputed land was vested forest or not, and that the civil court's jurisdiction was barred in this regard.

The third case dealt with a dispute over whether land was vested forest or not. The court stated that when there is a dispute over this matter, it can only be decided by the Forest Tribunal under section 8 of the Act, and civil court's jurisdiction is barred in this regard. The plaintiff's attempt to get a declaration that no part of the vested forest is included in the plaint schedule property is outside the purview of the civil court. The court found that the plaintiff failed to prove the identity of the property claimed by him as the same property exempted as per Ext.A2 judgment of the Forest Tribunal and dismissed the suit. The appeal was also dismissed, and the parties were directed to bear their respective costs in the appeal.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of different courts and tribunals when it comes to disputes over land ownership and forest rights. The Kerala Private Forest (Vesting and Assignment) Act plays a significant role in these cases, and it is essential for parties to understand its provisions and the role of the Forest Tribunal in resolving disputes. Failure to do so can result in cases being dismissed or appeals being denied, as seen in these examples.
