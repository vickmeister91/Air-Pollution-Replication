The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was the subject of a criminal petition filed by Mr. Mark Bauer, a US national. Bauer was accused of being the manager of M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India Limited, a company that allegedly caused water pollution. However, Bauer claimed that he was only a consultant and had no involvement in the company's management. The court accepted Bauer's claim and quashed the proceedings against him.

The case highlights the importance of accurately identifying the roles and responsibilities of individuals within a company. In this case, Bauer was able to successfully argue that he was not responsible for the actions of the company because he was only a consultant. This underscores the need for companies to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of their employees and consultants to avoid legal issues.

The court's decision also raises questions about the liability of foreign nationals in cases of environmental pollution. Bauer, as a US national, was able to avoid prosecution in India for his alleged involvement in the pollution caused by M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India Limited. This highlights the need for international cooperation and coordination in cases of environmental pollution, as pollution can have far-reaching effects that transcend national borders.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of accurately identifying the roles and responsibilities of individuals within a company, as well as the need for international cooperation in cases of environmental pollution. It also highlights the challenges of holding foreign nationals accountable for environmental crimes committed in other countries.
