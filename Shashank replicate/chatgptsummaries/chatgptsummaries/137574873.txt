The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Nisar Hussain, a scrap dealer, whose shop was sealed by the police under Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner argued that the police officer had no power to seal the immovable property, and the court agreed, citing previous judgments. The court directed the Station House Officer to remove the seal on the petitioner's shop and vacate the premises after making an inventory of the articles seized. The petitioner was entitled to vacant possession of the premises, and the court did not express any opinion on the seizure of material and other articles.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the powers of the police in sealing immovable property. The court held that the Station House Officer of a police station does not have the authority to seal the immovable property of a citizen. This decision is in line with previous judgments that have held that the power to seal immovable property lies with the magistrate and not with the police.

The court's decision is based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court noted that Section 102 of the Code empowers a police officer to seize any property that is suspected to be stolen or that is likely to be used for the commission of an offence. However, the section does not give the police officer the power to seal immovable property.

The court also referred to Section 451 of the Code, which deals with the power of the magistrate to order the seizure of property. The court noted that under this section, the magistrate has the power to order the seizure of any property that is suspected to be stolen or that is likely to be used for the commission of an offence. The magistrate also has the power to seal the property if he deems it necessary.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of separation of powers between the police and the judiciary. The police cannot be allowed to exercise powers that are reserved for the judiciary. The court's decision also ensures that citizens' rights are protected and that they are not subjected to arbitrary action by the police.

The court's decision also has implications for the way in which the police carry out their duties. The police will now have to be more careful in the exercise of their powers and ensure that they do not overstep their authority. The decision also highlights the need for police officers to be trained in the relevant laws and procedures so that they can carry out their duties effectively and within the bounds of the law.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by Nisar Hussain is a significant one as it clarifies the powers of the police in sealing immovable property. The court's decision upholds the principle of separation of powers between the police and the judiciary and ensures that citizens' rights are protected. The decision also has implications for the way in which the police carry out their duties and highlights the need for police officers to be trained in the relevant laws and procedures.
