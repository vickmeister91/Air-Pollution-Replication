The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a limited notice in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) regarding the covering of a sewage treatment plant by pucca construction and putting an exit on the same height as mentioned in the Pollution Control Act. The issue concerns Jaipur Dairy and the sewerage treatment plant installed in its precincts. The PIL was filed by a group of citizens who alleged that the Jaipur Dairy had covered the sewage treatment plant with pucca construction, which was in violation of the Pollution Control Act. The petitioners also alleged that the exit of the plant was at the same height as the surrounding area, which could lead to the spread of diseases.

Jaipur Dairy filed documents showing that it had sought permission from Jaipur Nagar Nigam to lay down a pucca sewerage line and permission was granted. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board inspected the precincts of Jaipur Dairy and renewed the consent which was given for the sewerage treatment plant. The court noted that the respondents had complied with the directions issued concerning prayer (b) and disposed of the writ petition as infructuous.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the respondents had complied with the directions issued by the court regarding prayer (b). The court did not find any evidence to suggest that the respondents had violated the Pollution Control Act or any other law. The court also noted that the respondents had obtained the necessary permissions from the relevant authorities before constructing the pucca sewerage line and installing the sewerage treatment plant.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions before undertaking any construction activity. It also emphasizes the need to comply with the directions issued by the court and the relevant authorities. The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on the environment as it ensures that the sewage treatment plant is constructed in compliance with the Pollution Control Act.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's decision in the PIL regarding the covering of a sewage treatment plant by pucca construction and putting an exit on the same height as mentioned in the Pollution Control Act is a significant step towards ensuring environmental protection. The court's decision emphasizes the need to obtain the necessary permissions before undertaking any construction activity and to comply with the directions issued by the court and the relevant authorities. The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on the environment and ensure that the sewage treatment plant is constructed in compliance with the Pollution Control Act.
