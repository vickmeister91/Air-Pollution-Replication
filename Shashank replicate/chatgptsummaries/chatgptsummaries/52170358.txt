The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Om Prakash regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the State Pollution Control Board to inspect the canals and report on the pollution being caused, and for the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that the state takes necessary measures to prevent pollution of water bodies.

In another court order, the State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples from distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state had planned to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal to prevent contamination. The court imposed damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court also ordered the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date and imposed a cost if the state failed to submit a short term and long term scheme and action taken report.

The court also directed the state to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The state was also directed to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant. The court emphasized the importance of taking necessary measures to prevent contamination of water bodies and ensuring that the state complies with the directions in letter and spirit.

In another court order, the court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal, which are causing contamination of canal water. The state government was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, failing which appropriate action will be taken. The compliance report filed by the state government was found to be inadequate, and the court gave the state government another opportunity to file a response.

In yet another court order, the Counsel for the State was given another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also ordered the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental protection.

The court also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

In the final court order, the court discussed a petitioner seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching a writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concluded that the tribunal did not lack jurisdiction and that the petitioner should avail of the alternative remedy provided under the Act of 2010. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT was expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State was restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016.

In conclusion, the court orders emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that necessary measures are taken to prevent pollution of water bodies. The court directed the state to prepare comprehensive and short-term schemes with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court also imposed damages or compensation on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court emphasized the importance of complying with the directions in letter and spirit and taking necessary measures to prevent contamination of water bodies.
