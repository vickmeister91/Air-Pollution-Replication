In the case of Rajesh Shrivastav vs The State of Madhya Pradesh, the court issued an order on January 9, 2013, which directed the Van Vikas Nigam not to remove any trees except in accordance with the law. The law referred to in the order is the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, specifically sections 38-O and 38-V. These sections of the Act deal with the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and prohibit any activity that may cause damage to them.

The court also noted that the Tiger Conservation Authority has the power to issue directions for the protection of tigers and tiger reserves, and the state government must prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan. The court directed the respondents to ensure compliance with these provisions before any action is taken to remove trees. This means that the authorities must take into account the impact of any tree removal on the wildlife and their habitats, and ensure that it does not harm the tiger population or their habitats.

Tigers are an endangered species, and their population has been declining rapidly due to habitat loss, poaching, and other factors.
