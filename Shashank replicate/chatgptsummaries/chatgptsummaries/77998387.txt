The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Triveni Rice Mill challenging show cause notices issued to them for operating their industry without permission under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court stated that since the petitioner had only applied for permission on 02.01.2018, some time was required for the statutory authorities to consider the request for grant of consent.

The case revolved around the issue of whether M/S Triveni Rice Mill had the necessary permissions to operate their industry. The company had been issued show cause notices for operating without permission under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The company had challenged these notices in a writ petition filed before the Madhya Pradesh High Court.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had only applied for permission on 02.01.2018, and that some time was required for the statutory authorities to consider the request for grant of consent. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to produce any evidence to show that they had made any efforts to obtain the necessary permissions prior to the issuance of the show cause notices.

The court's decision highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions before operating an industry. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 are both aimed at preventing and controlling pollution, and require industries to obtain the necessary permissions before commencing operations.

The court's decision also underscores the need for companies to be proactive in obtaining the necessary permissions. Companies should make efforts to obtain the necessary permissions well in advance of commencing operations, and should be able to produce evidence of these efforts if required.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's decision in the case of M/S Triveni Rice Mill serves as a reminder of the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions before operating an industry. Companies should be proactive in obtaining these permissions, and should be able to produce evidence of their efforts if required.
