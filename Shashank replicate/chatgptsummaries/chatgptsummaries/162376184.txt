In a recent court case, an application for condonation of delay in a revision case was allowed due to the petitioner's lack of knowledge of the impugned order. The petitioner had requested certain documents under Section 207 of the Cr.P.C., which were dismissed by the impugned order. However, the petitioner made a limited prayer that if the documents cannot be provided under Section 207, they can be provided under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the revision with the liberty to call for the document under Section 91 if necessary for the adjudication of the criminal case. This decision was made in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and the principles of natural justice.

The petitioner had argued that the impugned order was passed without considering the relevant documents and evidence, which were necessary for the proper adjudication of the case. The petitioner had also contended that the impugned order was passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, found that the impugned order was indeed passed without considering the relevant documents and evidence. The court also found that the petitioner was not given an opportunity to be heard before the impugned order was passed.

In light of these findings, the court allowed the application for condonation of delay and granted the petitioner the liberty to call for the document under Section 91 if necessary for the adjudication of the criminal case. This decision was made in order to ensure that the principles of natural justice were upheld and that the petitioner was given a fair opportunity to present their case.

Overall, this court case highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant documents and evidence are considered before passing an order in a criminal case. It also emphasizes the need to give all parties a fair opportunity to be heard before making a decision. By upholding these principles, the court was able to ensure that justice was served in this case.
