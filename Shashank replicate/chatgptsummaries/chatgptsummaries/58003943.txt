The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard an appeal by M.P. Patil against the Ministry of Environment and Forests' grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) to the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) for a power project in Bijapur District, Karnataka. The appellant claimed that the project would have devastating effects on the environment and that the land acquired for the project was fertile agricultural land. The appellant also alleged that the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Report (DEIAR) contained false and misleading information. The court ordered a review of the project's impact on the environment and the acquisition of land.

The court order discusses a challenge to the grant of an EC to the NTPC on the grounds of misrepresentation, inadequate public hearing, non-adherence to terms of reference (TOR), lack of a Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) plan, and changes in coal source. The NTPC argues that the site was selected after due consideration and that the project is of public importance, necessary for addressing energy deficits. The court order presents both sides of the argument and provides details on the specific grounds of challenge.

The court order discusses the environmental impact assessment (EIA) study for the Kudgi power project. The NTPC claims that the project will not have a devastating effect on the environment or people's lives. The order also mentions the monitoring of air quality, water usage, and treatment processes. The court examines the issue of land use and whether the NTPC misrepresented the nature and categorization of the land required for the project. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions challenging the decision to set up the power project, but the present appeal and contentions of the parties are saved by the order of the High Court.

The court order discusses the acquisition of land for a power plant project in Kudgi, Karnataka. The order questions the claim that the land is mostly barren and rocky, as it has been used for agriculture, including betel leaf crops, for over 100 years. The court also notes discrepancies in the amount of land to be acquired and the type of land described in various documents. The court suggests that the NTPC may have deliberately provided false information to obtain approval for the project. The court also notes that the land is in the command area of the Mulwad Lift Irrigation Scheme and that the MoEF discourages the use of fertile agricultural land for industrial purposes. The court concludes that the land in question is not mostly barren and rocky, as claimed by the NTPC, and that the acquisition of the land would force farmers to migrate in search of their livelihood.

The court order discusses the land categorization for a project and concludes that the land is primarily agricultural, not barren as claimed by the NTPC. The court also notes that the NTPC did not disclose all relevant information regarding the impact of the project on the welfare of people and vulnerable groups, as required by the EIA Notification. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and finding a balance between development and the environment. The issue of R&R policy is also discussed.

The court order discusses the importance of considering the impact of development on society, particularly with regards to displacement of people from their livelihoods. The court notes that a comprehensive R&R plan is necessary for the project and must be submitted to the MoEF within a specific time frame. The court also highlights the non-compliance of the TOR by NTPC, as they did not submit a detailed R&R plan even after the order of EC was passed. The court further emphasizes the need for a holistic effort to improve the living standards of affected people and acknowledges the obligation of State Governments/PSUs and other bodies concerned to provide R&R benefits to the affected people at a rate not below that prescribed in the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007.

The court order discusses the NTPC's R&R policy and its implementation in the case of the Kudgi STPP. The policy requires a proactive approach and appropriate planning of land acquisition, including conducting a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and a Socio Economic Survey (SES) to collect detailed demographic details of the area. The NTPC has not prepared the list of project-affected persons despite two years passing from the date of issuance of Land Acquisition notice. The court order highlights the need for the NTPC to implement its R&R policy within a specified time and with a consensual approach and participation of all stakeholders.

The court order discusses the process of land acquisition for a power plant project and the lack of a comprehensive R&R plan. It also addresses concerns about the location of air quality monitoring stations and the variation in coal quality. The court finds that the monitoring stations were not located as required by the TOR and that the coal quality issue should be handled at the MoEF level.

The court order clarifies that firm coal linkage is required at the stage of consideration of grant of EC and not at the stage of TOR. The impact on air quality due to the proposed power plant was worked out with less sulphur content at the time of DEIAR, but the sulphur content was higher in coal at the time of final EC given by MoEF. The establishment of the thermal power plant at Kudgi would fall within the ambit of permissible sustainable development. The court expects that the overall impact on the environment would be within the prescribed limits by taking appropriate anti-pollution measures and
