The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Daily Bread Bakers against a sealing order passed by the Monitoring Committee in January 2018. The court notes that any challenge to the sealing order passed by the Monitoring Committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court will lie before the Hon'ble Supreme Court only. The petitioner is directed to approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to challenge the order dated 5th January, 2018, passed by the Monitoring Committee appointed by it.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Daily Bread Bakers and the Monitoring Committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Monitoring Committee had passed a sealing order in January 2018, which Daily Bread Bakers had challenged in court. However, the court has now ruled that any challenge to the sealing order passed by the Monitoring Committee will have to be made before the Hon'ble Supreme Court only.

The court's ruling is significant because it clarifies the jurisdiction of the Monitoring Committee and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in matters related to sealing orders. The Monitoring Committee was appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to oversee the sealing of unauthorized constructions in Delhi. However, the court has now made it clear that any challenge to the sealing orders passed by the Monitoring Committee will have to be made before the Hon'ble Supreme Court only.

The court's ruling also has implications for other parties who may have challenged sealing orders passed by the Monitoring Committee in the past. It is likely that such parties will now have to approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court to challenge the sealing orders, rather than the lower courts.

Overall, the court's ruling in this case is significant because it clarifies the jurisdiction of the Monitoring Committee and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in matters related to sealing orders. It also has implications for other parties who may have challenged sealing orders passed by the Monitoring Committee in the past.
