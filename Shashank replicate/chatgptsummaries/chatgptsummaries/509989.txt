The Patna High Court recently issued a court order in relation to two writ petitions filed by Kanhaiya Rai and Ayodhya Rai against the State of Bihar and others. The petitions were filed in relation to the release of licensed guns that were seized in a criminal case initiated against the petitioners under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. The court had to determine whether the trying court had the power to deal with the release of goods based on the report of seizure and production of seizure list marked exhibit in the case, even though the seized goods were not physically produced before it.

The court held that the report of seizure and/or production of seizure list of the goods seized in the court subserves the mandate of the section requiring production of goods. This means that the report of seizure and production of seizure list is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the law that the goods be produced before the court. The court also held that in a case where the goods were the subject-matter of trial, the jurisdiction vests in the court which held the trial. This means that the court that held the trial has the power to deal with the release of the goods.

The court dismissed the writ petitions with directions and observations. This means that the court did not grant the relief sought by the petitioners, but instead provided guidance on how the matter should be dealt with. The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the law on the release of seized goods in criminal cases.

The court's decision is based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the law and the facts of the case. The court noted that Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code provides for punishment for attempt to murder. The court also noted that the seized goods in this case were licensed guns. The court observed that the trial court had ordered the seizure of the guns and had marked the seizure list as exhibit in the case.

The court then considered the question of whether the trying court had the power to deal with the release of the guns based on the report of seizure and production of seizure list marked exhibit in the case. The court held that the report of seizure and/or production of seizure list of the goods seized in the court subserves the mandate of the section requiring production of goods. The court explained that the purpose of requiring the production of goods before the court is to ensure that the court has the opportunity to examine the goods and determine their relevance to the case.

The court also held that in a case where the goods were the subject-matter of trial, the jurisdiction vests in the court which held the trial. The court explained that this is because the trial court is in the best position to determine the relevance of the goods to the case. The court noted that the trial court had ordered the seizure of the guns and had marked the seizure list as exhibit in the case. The court therefore held that the trial court had the power to deal with the release of the guns.

The court dismissed the writ petitions with directions and observations. The court directed the trial court to consider the question of release of the guns in accordance with the law and the observations made by the court. The court also observed that the trial court should consider the question of release of the guns expeditiously, as the guns were licensed and the petitioners had a right to possess them.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case clarifies the law on the release of seized goods in criminal cases. The court held that the report of seizure and/or production of seizure list of the goods seized in the court subserves the mandate of the section requiring production of goods. The court also held that in a case where the goods were the subject-matter of trial, the jurisdiction vests in the court which held the trial. The court dismissed the writ petitions with directions and observations, providing guidance on how the matter should be dealt with. The court's decision is significant because it ensures that the law is applied consistently and fairly in cases involving the release of seized goods.
