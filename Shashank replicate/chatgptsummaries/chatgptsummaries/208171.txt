The court order in question pertains to a case involving Kishor and the State, where Kishor challenged an order passed by the District Development Officer in Ahmedabad regarding the withdrawal of a higher grade pay scale. The court admitted the appeal and waived service of notice of admission of appeal for the respondents. 

Upon review, the court found no defect in the order regarding the cancellation of withdrawal of option exercised by the appellant-petitioner and restoration of his pay-scale. However, the order of recovery of excess amount paid to the appellant-petitioner was set aside. 

The court's decision was to partly allow the appeal, and no costs were awarded. This ruling has significant implications for the parties involved, as it means that Kishor will be able to retain his higher grade pay scale without having to repay any excess amount that may have been paid to him. 

It is important to note that this ruling was made after a thorough review of the case and consideration of all relevant factors. The court took into account the arguments presented by both parties and made a decision that it deemed to be fair and just. 

Overall, this court order serves as an example of the importance of the judicial system in ensuring that justice is served and that the rights of individuals are protected. It also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights and to seek legal recourse when necessary.
