The court order pertains to a criminal revision case between Dhruv Varma and K K Puri (HUF) under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The revisionist had filed an application under section 91 CrPC seeking directions to the complainant to produce certain documents to prove his innocence, which was dismissed by the trial court. The revisionist filed a revision petition against this order, which was dismissed by the additional sessions judge on the grounds that an order on application under section 91 CrPC is interlocutory in nature and a revision against such order is barred under section 397 (2) CrPC. The court order cites the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Sethuraman Vs Rajamanickam (2009) 5 SCC 153 to support this view. The court order concludes by dismissing the revision petition and sending the trial court record back to the concerned trial court.

In this case, Dhruv Varma had filed an application under section 91 CrPC seeking directions to the complainant to produce certain documents to prove his innocence. However, the trial court dismissed this application, which led to the filing of a revision petition by the revisionist. The additional sessions judge dismissed the revision petition on the grounds that an order on application under section 91 CrPC is interlocutory in nature and a revision against such order is barred under section 397 (2) CrPC.

The court order cites the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Sethuraman Vs Rajamanickam (2009) 5 SCC 153 to support this view. In this case, the Supreme Court had held that an order passed on an application under section 91 CrPC is an interlocutory order and a revision against such order is not maintainable under section 397 (2) CrPC. The court order in the present case follows this judgment and dismisses the revision petition.

The court order also directs that the trial court record be sent back to the concerned trial court along with a copy of the order. The revision file will be consigned to the record room after completion of all necessary formalities. This indicates that the case has been closed and no further action can be taken on it.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of understanding the nature of orders passed under different sections of the CrPC. An order passed on an application under section 91 CrPC is considered interlocutory in nature and a revision against such order is not maintainable under section 397 (2) CrPC. It is important for litigants to be aware of these provisions and seek appropriate legal advice before filing any petitions or applications in court.
