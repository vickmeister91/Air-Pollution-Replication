The case of Ram Asra involved an application filed under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for directing the State to produce original documents. The witness produced the original receipts, and the application was disposed of. However, the petitioner filed a revision, which was dismissed by the court. The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge these orders.

The court found that the cause raised by the petitioner was misconceived and dismissed the petition. The court also noted that the right of the accused to seek production of a document will have to be pleaded by him before the trial court and not in the manner he is seeking the production thereof.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue a summons to any person for the production of such document or thing.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge these orders.
