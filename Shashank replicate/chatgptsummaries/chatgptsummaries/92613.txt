In a case related to the deteriorating air quality in Delhi, the court had issued directions to convert the entire city bus fleet to a single fuel mode of CNG by March 31, 2001. However, neither the government nor private bus operators acted diligently to comply with the directions. As a result, the court was forced to intervene and issue a new order.

The court declined to give a blanket extension of the deadline but made some relaxations or exemptions for schools, DTC, contract carriage operators, and owners of other commercial vehicles who had placed firm orders for CNG vehicles or conversion to CNG mode. This was done to ensure that the public transportation system did not come to a complete halt and that essential services were not affected.

The court also directed the Bhure Lal Committee to examine the question of low sulfur diesel as a clean fuel and submit a report within one month. This was an important step towards finding alternative solutions to the problem of air pollution in Delhi.

The court's order was a wake-up call for the government and private bus operators to take the issue of air pollution seriously. It was a reminder that the health and well-being of the citizens of Delhi should be a top priority.

The court's decision to exempt certain categories of vehicles from the deadline was a pragmatic one. It recognized that the conversion to CNG mode was a time-consuming process and that it was not possible for all vehicles to be converted within the given timeframe. The exemptions ensured that essential services were not disrupted and that the public transportation system continued to function.

The court's decision to direct the Bhure Lal Committee to examine the question of low sulfur diesel as a clean fuel was a significant one. It showed that the court was open to exploring alternative solutions to the problem of air pollution in Delhi. The committee's report would provide valuable insights into the feasibility of using low sulfur diesel as a clean fuel and would help the court make informed decisions in the future.

In conclusion, the court's order was a significant step towards addressing the problem of air pollution in Delhi. It was a reminder to the government and private bus operators that they had a responsibility towards the citizens of Delhi and that they needed to take the issue of air pollution seriously. The exemptions granted by the court ensured that essential services were not disrupted, while the direction to the Bhure Lal Committee to examine the question of low sulfur diesel as a clean fuel was a step towards finding alternative solutions to the problem of air pollution.
