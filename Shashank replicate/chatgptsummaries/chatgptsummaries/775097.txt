The court case in question involved a dispute over a grant of rent-free land made by an Ahom King in Assam for the establishment of a vaishnavic institution for the propagation of Nama Dharma and Sravana Kirtana Dharma. The plaintiffs, who claimed to be descendants of the Bhakats mentioned in the copper plate creating the endowment, filed a suit for a declaration that the disputed land was a gift to the institution and for possession. The defendants, who were alleged to be the heirs of the original grantee, contended that the land was not Dharmottar but a property gifted to their predecessor.

The trial court held that the suit was not maintainable because the provisions of Section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code had not been followed and that the suit property was Brahmottar and not Dharmottar. However, the appellate court held that the suit did not fall within Section 92 and that the suit property was Dharmottar. The High Court agreed with the lower court's translation of the relevant passage of the copper plate and dismissed the appeal.

The plaintiffs sought to raise the same points before the Supreme Court, but the court found that the reliefs claimed did not fall under section 92 and that the High Court's interpretation of the grant was correct. The court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership between the plaintiffs and defendants, who are descendants of the original grantee.

The court ultimately held that the relief claimed did not come within the provisions of Section 92 and that the grant was a Dharmottar grant made for the propagation of Sravana Kirtana Dharma and not to the high priest and his own brothers in their personal capacity. The court order states that the translation provided in the High Court judgment is correct and there is no reason to doubt it. The judges in the High Court were more familiar with the historical background and were in a better position to interpret the terms of the grant.

The court also refers to a previous case where the lands described as Brahmottar lands were deemed heritable and transferable without any restrictions. However, in this case, the court found that the land was not Brahmottar but Dharmottar, and therefore, the defendants did not have the right to transfer or sell the land.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the copper plate, which clearly stated that the land was granted for the establishment of a vaishnavic institution for the propagation of Nama Dharma and Sravana Kirtana Dharma. The court found that the grant was made for a religious purpose and not for the personal benefit of the high priest and his brothers.

In conclusion, the court order settles a long-standing dispute over land ownership between the plaintiffs and defendants. The court found that the land was granted for a religious purpose and not for the personal benefit of the high priest and his brothers. The court also found that the relief claimed did not fall under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code and that the High Court's interpretation of the grant was correct. The court's decision is based on the interpretation of the copper plate, which clearly stated the purpose of the grant. The court's decision is final, and the defendants are not allowed to transfer or sell the land.
