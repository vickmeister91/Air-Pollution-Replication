The National Green Tribunal Bar Association filed a petition against various government officials from different states and departments, including the Ministry of Environment and Forests, regarding the issue of illegal mining. The State of Madhya Pradesh also filed a review application. The court order lists the names of all the respondents and their respective positions. Several advocates represented the respondents in court.

The court order discusses an application filed by the M.P. State Mining Corporation Ltd. to intervene and be heard in a case filed by the Department of Mineral Resources, Government of Madhya Pradesh. The Supreme Court had passed orders related to mining of minerals and sand, and the State of Madhya Pradesh had filed an application for extension of time for compliance with these orders. The State of Madhya Pradesh claimed to have strictly monitored compliance with the rules and taken appropriate action against illegal mining activities. The National Green Tribunal had issued a notice restraining any person, company, or authority from carrying out any mining activity or removal of sand from river beds without obtaining environmental clearance and license from competent authorities. The case was adjourned for further arguments and reserved for judgment.

The court order directs mining authorities to comply with the given directions. The State of Madhya Pradesh has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court regarding the adverse effects of the order on legal mining activity. The court needs to answer whether the State Government was competent in enacting a law in constituting and empowering District Level Environmental Committee to grant EC for carrying on mining of minerals and sand in less than 5 ha. of area. The Environmental (Protection) Act 1986 was enacted to provide for protection and improvement of the environment. The Act of 1986 is the paramount law in relation to the environment. The Notification of 2006 deals with the various facets of controlling and preventing environmental pollution. Entry 1(a) of this Schedule of Regulations of 2006 deals with mining of minor or major minerals.

The court order states that mining activities in an area of 50 hectares or more are considered category A projects, while those in an area of less than 50 hectares but more than 5 hectares are category B projects. Both categories require clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) or the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). Mining of minor minerals in land leases less than 5 hectares is not allowed without clearance from the SEIAA. The order also includes specific conditions for mining in ecologically sensitive areas and for the renewal of mining leases.

The court order states that any person wanting to carry out mining activities for non-coal mines must obtain environmental clearance from the authority concerned. The Union Parliament has the power to legislate in the field of environment laws, while the State can legislate under Entry 23 of List II, subject to the limitations prescribed therein. The Act of 1957 primarily deals with the grant of licenses or mining leases, terms and conditions of their continuation, and termination purposes for which such licenses could be granted. Section 15 of the Act of 1957 empowers the State Government to make rules in respect of minor minerals.

The court order states that the government has the power to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases, or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals. The court also notes that the legislature is aware of existing laws and the legislative intent behind their enactment. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental concerns and controlling pollution while permitting mining activity. The court also states that the State Government cannot frame rules outside the ambit of Section 15 of the Act of 1957. The court directs that environmental plans must be in consonance with existing law and cannot be in conflict with central law.

The court order states that the District Level Committee cannot grant environmental clearance for mining projects as this power is vested only with the MoEF or SEIAA under the Central law. The State Government cannot alter or bypass the statutory procedure for granting environmental clearance. The court also justifies the need for stringent regulation of mining activities to prevent environmental degradation and revenue loss due to illegal mining. The State's argument of financial loss and delay in granting environmental clearance is dismissed, and the application is dismissed with no costs awarded.

In summary, the court order pertains to the issue of illegal mining and the need for environmental clearance and compliance with regulations. The National Green Tribunal Bar Association filed a petition against various government officials, and the State of Madhya Pradesh filed a review application. The court order lists the names of all the respondents and their respective positions. The court directs mining authorities to comply with the given directions, and the State of Madhya Pradesh has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court regarding the adverse effects of the order on legal mining activity.
