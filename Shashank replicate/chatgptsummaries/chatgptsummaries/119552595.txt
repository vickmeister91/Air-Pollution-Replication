The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been the subject of several court orders regarding the interpretation and application of its provisions on limitation and the jurisdiction to condone delays in filing appeals. In one case, the NGT heard an appeal by Sunil Kumar Samanta against the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and others regarding the closure of his auto emission testing center. The Pollution Control Appellate Authority had upheld the closure order, and the appellant filed an appeal 104 days after the deadline. The respondents argued that the appeal was hopelessly barred and that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to condone the delay. The appellant argued that the Limitation Act should apply, and the Tribunal should construe the law of limitation liberally. The Tribunal noted that the appellant had initially filed a writ petition before the High Court of Calcutta, which was dismissed as withdrawn, and the appeal was filed in the Tribunal registry on May 29, 2013. The Tribunal allowed the appellant's application for condonation of delay and heard the appeal.

However, another court order discusses an appeal filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under the NGT Act. The appellant had filed for condonation of delay, but the appeal was still filed beyond the outer period of limitation of 90 days. The court explains that the NGT Act provides for a special limitation period and overrides the general law of limitation. The tribunal loses jurisdiction to entertain an appeal after the expiry of the special period of limitation provided under proviso to Section 16 of the NGT Act. The court cites a previous case where it was held that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond a period of 90 days, even if a sufficient cause is shown and the provisions of the Limitation Act including Section 5 are excluded.

Another court order discusses the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act to an application challenging an award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court held that the phrase "but not thereafter" in Section 34 amounts to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and therefore bars the application of Section 5. The court also emphasized the importance of the period fixed under Section 34 and held that an application filed beyond the prescribed period cannot be entertained. The order cites several cases to support its conclusion and emphasizes that the use of negative words in a provision implies a mandatory requirement.

In another court order, the interpretation of Section 16 of the NGT Act, which sets a 90-day limit for filing appeals, is discussed. The court concludes that the language of the provision is clear and unambiguous, and that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone delays beyond the 90-day limit. The court also notes that the NGT Act is a self-contained code that excludes the application of the general law of limitation provided under the Limitation Act. The court cites various cases to support its conclusion that the NGT Act's provisions are mandatory and must be followed.

The court order also discusses the interpretation of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act in relation to the Representation of the Peoples' Act, 1951. The court held that exclusion can be by explicit language or necessary implication, depending on the self-contained code and intent of the legislature. The court also cites cases where specific exclusion was not evident from the language of the provision but there was a clear absence of "delay-condoning sections" of the Limitation Act in the special statute, which amounted to exclusion. The court concludes that the NGT Act is a self-contained code with unambiguous provisions of limitation, clearly stating exclusion of the general law of limitation.

The court order also discusses the application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act to various provisions of different statutes. The court concludes that where provisions of limitation under different statutes use words like "not exceeding," "not more than," "not beyond," or "not thereafter," the general provisions of the Limitation Act would stand excluded. The court cites various cases to support this conclusion and rejects the argument that the benefit of the provisions of the Limitation Act would be available in the case before them. The court also discusses the principle of implied exclusion and the concept of a complete code.

Another court order concerns the condonation of delay in filing an appeal and the respective rights and obligations of the parties involved. The court held that the law of limitation is a substantive law and should be adhered to appropriately depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case. The court rejected the appellant's contention that the National Green Tribunal is the forum to which first appeal is provided against the orders specified in Section 16 of the NGT Act and that these provisions should be construed liberally. The court also explained the distinction between mandatory and directory provisions in law and held that failure to comply with a directory provision does not invalidate underlying proceedings unless the complaining party can show serious prejudice, while non-compliance of a mandatory statute would not necessarily require the presence of prejudice. The court cited previous cases to support its decision.

The court order also discusses the distinction between mandatory and directory provisions in statutes. It cites various cases to explain that the language, purpose, and consequences of a provision must be considered to determine whether it is mandatory or directory. The order specifically applies this analysis to Section 16 of the NGT Act, which it finds to be a mandatory provision with serious civil
