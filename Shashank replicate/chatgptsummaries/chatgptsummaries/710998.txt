The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by appellants seeking to prevent the respondents from changing the use of land reserved as 'open space' and declaring the sale made by the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) in favor of State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (the Bank) null and void. The court held that the UIT acted illegally and against the provisions of the Act and Rules in transferring the land in dispute to the Bank. The court also referred to the constitutional imperative on the State Government and municipalities to ensure and safeguard proper environment and an imperative duty to take adequate measures to promote, protect and improve both the man-made and the natural environment.

The court order states that the action taken by the government and the municipality would defeat the purpose of the scheme. The court refers to a previous case where a building was ordered to be pulled down and the land brought back to its original condition. In this case, a sale-deed had been executed but no construction had been done. The court holds that the action of transferring the land to the bank was bad and the sale-deed is void. The court directs the UIT to refund the sale-consideration with interest or allot alternative land to the bank within two months. The appeal is allowed and the order of the Single Judge is set aside.

The court order is a significant development in the ongoing legal battle over the use of land reserved as 'open space' in Bikaner.
