In a recent court order, the accused/applicants who were arrested by the Forest Department for possession of a leopard skin under the Wild Life Protection Act were granted bail. The defense argued that the leopard was killed in a flood three years earlier and the skin was kept by the present applicants. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.3,000/- each and one solvent surety each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for their appearance on all the dates of hearing during trial.

The case involved the possession of a leopard skin, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused/applicants were arrested by the Forest Department and charged with the possession of the skin. The defense argued that the leopard was killed in a flood three years earlier and the skin was kept by the present applicants. The court considered this argument and granted bail to the accused/applicants.

The court directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.3,000/- each and one solvent surety each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for their appearance on all the dates of hearing during trial. This means that the accused/applicants will have to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that they will appear in court on all the dates of the trial. If they fail to appear, they will forfeit the money.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused/applicants is significant because it allows them to be released from custody while they await trial. This is important because it ensures that the accused/applicants are not held in custody for an extended period of time without being convicted of a crime. It also allows them to prepare their defense and gather evidence to support their case.
