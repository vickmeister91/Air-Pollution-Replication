The Madras High Court recently received a writ petition from the Vadalur Sarvodaya Nagar and others, requesting that the respondents stop the storage and transport of coal from or through Vadalur, Cuddalore District. The petitioner claimed that the operation of the lignite depot at Vadalur was causing high levels of suspended and respirable particulate matter, which was harmful to the environment and human health. The court ordered the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to inspect and submit a report on whether the activities of the respondents were detrimental to the public.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board conducted a survey and found that the pollution levels were within the specified limits. The report stated that the respondents had taken adequate steps to prevent pollution, including dust suppression systems, covered conveyors, and green belts. The court order states that the respondents have complied with all the necessary measures to control pollution in their plant, including installing dust suppression systems, covering conveyor systems, and using acoustic enclosures.

The court found that the respondents had complied with the necessary regulations and allowed them to continue their operations. The court also notes that the requirement for a public hearing was made optional in 1994 and was not mandatory when the Environmental Clearance was given to the respondents. The court ultimately decides to dispose of the case without any further orders.
