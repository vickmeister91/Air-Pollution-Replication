The court order involves multiple writ petitions and a contempt petition related to construction activities in various areas of Karnataka. The first writ petition seeks to quash an order passed by the Karnataka State Appellate Authority under the Water and Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974, 1981. The second writ petition seeks to quash criminal proceedings initiated against a construction company. The contempt petition seeks to initiate contempt proceedings against the construction company for violating an interim order.

In one of the writ petitions, the petitioner argues that the State should regulate construction activity in Pattandur Village, which is included as a Metropolitan Area in a notification. The petitioner also claims that the construction plan approved by the Mahadevapura City Council is in total contravention of the terms and conditions imposed in a conversion passed by the Special Deputy Commissioner. The court order outlines conditions for the use of converted land for non-agricultural purposes, including obtaining permission from the competent authority, utilizing the land only for specified purposes, and following approved construction plans. The order also requires the reservation of land for government purposes and prohibits construction within a certain distance from roads. Failure to comply with these conditions may result in the cancellation of the conversion order and penalties. The order also discusses the applicability of the BDA Act and the requirements for forming extensions or layouts for building purposes.

The court orders the quashing of the CFE granted to the company and emphasizes the importance of following natural justice principles.

The petitioner argues that they have received acknowledgments for their applications and, therefore, have been granted CFE. The court order cites previous judgments and regulations to support its decision.

The petitioner argues that the building violates certain laws and regulations, including those related to group housing and means of access. However, the court finds that the petitioner's arguments are not valid and that the construction of the building is legal. The court also addresses the issue of sewage disposal and trade effluent, but ultimately concludes that the construction of the building is not in violation of any relevant laws or regulations.

The court order states that the construction of a building on a plot of land without obtaining a Consent for Effluent Certificate from the Pollution Control Board is illegal and in violation of Section 25 of the Water Act. However, the Construction Company argues that they are exempt from this requirement based on a notification issued by the Central Pollution Control Board. The court finds that the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board had the power to review and grant consent for construction, and that the petitioner has no right to appeal against the decision. The court also finds that the construction is not in violation of zoning regulations and building bye-laws. Therefore, the court rules in favor of the Construction Company.

The court also notes that there is a consent for discharge of effluent from the building and that the construction company has undertaken to install a treatment plant to ensure proper treatment of sewage. The court dismisses the petitioner's claims and denies the relief sought in the writ petition.
