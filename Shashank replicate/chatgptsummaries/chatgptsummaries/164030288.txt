The Indian judiciary has been instrumental in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served. In two recent court orders, the courts have examined the relevance and necessity of documents sought to be produced in two separate cases.

The first court order pertains to a writ petition seeking to challenge the dismissal of an application under Section 91 Cr.PC for summoning documents in a corruption case related to the allotment of Letters of Intent, Unified Access Services Licenses, and Spectrum by the Department of Telecommunication. The petitioner, a public servant, was alleged to be an active participant in the conspiracy with the Minister.

The court examined the necessity and relevance of the documents sought to be produced for the purpose of cross-examination of a witness and held that the documents were vague and not necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case. The court also referred to the limitations of Section 91 Cr.PC and the entitlement of the accused to seek an order under the section only at the stage of defense.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC) empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the section also imposes certain limitations on the exercise of this power. For instance, the court can only issue such an order if it is satisfied that the document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.

In the present case, the court found that the documents sought to be produced were vague and not necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case. The court also noted that the accused was entitled to seek an order under Section 91 Cr.PC only at the stage of defense. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition challenging the dismissal of the application under Section 91 Cr.PC.

The second court order denies a request for the production of various documents related to the movements and phone calls of a government official, as well as records of visitors to government buildings and meetings between ministers. The court finds that the request is a frivolous attempt to delay or sidetrack the trial and orders the petitioner to pay costs. The court emphasizes that discretion must be exercised in allowing the production of documents and that a roving inquiry into the case should be avoided.

In this case, the petitioner had sought the production of various documents related to the movements and phone calls of a government official, as well as records of visitors to government buildings and meetings between ministers. The court found that the request was a frivolous attempt to delay or sidetrack the trial and ordered the petitioner to pay costs.

The court emphasized that discretion must be exercised in allowing the production of documents and that a roving inquiry into the case should be avoided. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to be produced.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of exercising discretion in allowing the production of documents and the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to be produced. The courts have emphasized that a roving inquiry into the case should be avoided and that the accused is entitled to seek an order under Section 91 Cr.PC only at the stage of defense. These orders serve as a reminder that the judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served.
