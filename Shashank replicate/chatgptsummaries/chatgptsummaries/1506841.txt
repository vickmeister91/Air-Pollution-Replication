In a recent court order, a woman filed a suit to declare a birth certificate null and void, claiming that no child was born to her husband through the defendant. The defendant had obtained a judgment and decree on the basis of the fictitious birth certificate, appointing her as the guardian of the alleged minor child and allowing her to receive pension on behalf of the child. The plaintiff alleged that the birth certificate was fabricated and that the defendant had induced her husband to falsely declare the birth of a child.

The trial court and appellate court found in favor of the plaintiff, but the defendant appealed on the grounds that the suit was not maintainable without impleading the minor child. The court ultimately held that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of impleading the necessary party and allowed the appeal.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the validity of a birth certificate and the alleged fabrication of the same. The plaintiff, a woman, claimed that no child was born to her husband through the defendant and that the birth certificate was fictitious. The defendant, on the other hand, had obtained a judgment and decree on the basis of the same birth certificate, appointing her as the guardian of the alleged minor child and allowing her to receive pension on behalf of the child.

The trial court and appellate court both found in favor of the plaintiff, ruling that the birth certificate was indeed fabricated and that the defendant had induced the plaintiff's husband to falsely declare the birth of a child. However, the defendant appealed the decision on the grounds that the suit was not maintainable without impleading the minor child.

The court ultimately held that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of impleading the necessary party and allowed the appeal. This means that the plaintiff's case was dismissed as she had failed to include the minor child as a necessary party to the suit.

The court's decision highlights the importance of impleading all necessary parties in a suit. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of the case, as was the case here. It also serves as a reminder to ensure that all documents, such as birth certificates, are valid and not fabricated.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where a woman filed a suit to declare a birth certificate null and void, claiming that no child was born to her husband through the defendant. The trial court and appellate court found in favor of the plaintiff, ruling that the birth certificate was indeed fabricated and that the defendant had induced the plaintiff's husband to falsely declare the birth of a child. However, the defendant appealed the decision on the grounds that the suit was not maintainable without impleading the minor child. The court ultimately held that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of impleading the necessary party and allowed the appeal. This serves as a reminder to ensure that all necessary parties are impleaded in a suit and that all documents are valid and not fabricated.
