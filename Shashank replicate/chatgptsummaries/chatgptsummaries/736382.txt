The court order pertains to two writ petitions concerning the allotment of open space reserved for public use in a plan to a private body for a school. The Rajasthan Urban Areas (Sub-Division, Reconstruction and Improvement of Plots) Rules, 1975, provide for the approval of plans for subdivision, reconstruction, and improvement of plots with proper standards and provisions for roads, open space, educational facilities, and other facilities. The court examines the validity of the Jaipur Development Authority's decision to allot the open space to a private body for a school and concludes that the residents of the locality have the necessary locus standi to challenge the decision.

The court emphasizes the importance of protecting open spaces for recreation and preservation and promoting public interest in development schemes. It states that open spaces reserved for parks and playgrounds cannot be leased or sold to private individuals for conversion to other uses, as it goes against legislative intent and constitutional mandates. The court also emphasizes the importance of public welfare and the need for public spaces in urban areas. The court finds that the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) had no authority to allot a site reserved for open space to a private school, and that the JDA violated the principles of natural justice by not giving affected parties an opportunity to be heard.

The court orders the JDA to refund the amount paid by the school for the site and to pay a sum to the advocate who assisted in the case. The court expresses concern about the proper use and maintenance of similar open spaces in the city. It directs concerned public authorities to take immediate action against encroachments made by the public on public places meant for parks, gardens, and children's parks. The authorities should conduct a proper survey of such sites and prepare a list with full details and develop a scheme for their proper development and maintenance. Public-spirited persons may also be associated in the development and maintenance of such sites.

The court discusses the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India, which allows any member of the public to approach the court for relief if a person or determinate class of persons is unable to do so due to poverty or other debilities. The court can entertain even a letter addressed by an individual acting Pro Bono Publico. The order also discusses the case of JDA converting an open space intended for public use into a school and allotting it to a private person, which is not permissible under the law.

The court orders the JDA and its officers to prepare a list of such sites and frame a scheme for their development, maintenance, and look-after within six months. If any site of open space reserved for public use is found to be illegally occupied or sold, immediate steps should be taken to get possession of such sites. The list of such sites and the scheme should be made known to the public, especially to the residents of the locality concerned.

The court also discusses the philosophy of public interest litigation and the acceptance of postcard litigation as a part of the legal aid program. The court recognizes the importance of PIL in promoting the interests of the marginalized and the disadvantaged sections of society. It emphasizes that PIL is not a substitute for the ordinary legal remedies available to individuals but is a supplement to them.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of protecting open spaces for public use and promoting public interest in development schemes. It emphasizes the need for public welfare and the importance of public spaces in urban areas. The court directs concerned public authorities to take immediate action against encroachments made by the public on public places meant for parks, gardens, and children's parks. It orders the JDA to refund the amount paid by the school for the site and to pay a sum to the advocate who assisted in the case. The court also directs the JDA and its officers to prepare a list of such sites and frame a scheme for their development, maintenance, and look-after within six months.
