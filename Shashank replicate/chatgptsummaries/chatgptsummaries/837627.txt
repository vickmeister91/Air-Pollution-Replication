The court order in question pertains to a petition seeking the quashing/modification of an order passed by the Additional District & Sessions Judge in a criminal case related to the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner's tractor and trolley were seized by the police for allegedly illegally transporting Chambal Sand from the Chambal Crocodile Area. The petitioner had applied for their release, which was granted by the learned Magistrate on certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee. The petitioner filed a revision petition, which was partly allowed, and the amount of bank guarantee was reduced. The petitioner then invoked the inherent jurisdiction of the court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

The court held that there is no statutory requirement to furnish a bank guarantee for the release of the vehicle and set aside the condition of furnishing a bank guarantee. The tractor and trolley were ordered to be released on the petitioner furnishing a supurdaginama in the sum of Rs. 30,000/- with certain stipulations.
