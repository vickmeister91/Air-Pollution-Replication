The case in question involves a petition to quash an order passed by the Special Judge, C.B.I.-III, Patna, which allowed the C.B.I. to bring on record two letters dated 08.06.2001 and 23.07.2001 in connection with Special Case No. 05 of 2001 arising out of R.C. No. 08(A) /01. The petitioner contended that the prosecution was trying to fill in the lacuna in the case, which cannot be permitted to do so at the fag end of the case where most of the witnesses have been examined and evidence of defence has been closed.

The petitioner argued that the prosecution was attempting to introduce new evidence at a late stage in the proceedings, which would be prejudicial to the defence. The petitioner further contended that the court should not allow the prosecution to fill in gaps in the case at such a late stage, as it would be unfair to the defence.

However, the court found no error in the order passed by the court below and dismissed the application with the direction to give a copy of the two letters summoned by it to the petitioner. The court held that the prosecution had the right to introduce new evidence at any stage of the proceedings, as long as it was relevant to the case and did not prejudice the defence.

The court noted that the two letters in question were relevant to the case and could shed light on the events that led to the filing of the case. The court also noted that the defence had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution.

The court further held that the introduction of new evidence at a late stage in the proceedings was not necessarily prejudicial to the defence. The court noted that the defence had the opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution and that the court would consider all the evidence presented before making a decision.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition to quash the order passed by the Special Judge, C.B.I.-III, Patna, allowing the C.B.I. to bring on record two letters dated 08.06.2001 and 23.07.2001 in connection with Special Case No. 05 of 2001 arising out of R.C. No. 08(A) /01. The court held that the prosecution had the right to introduce new evidence at any stage of the proceedings, as long as it was relevant to the case and did not prejudice the defence. The court also noted that the defence had the opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution and that the court would consider all the evidence presented before making a decision.
