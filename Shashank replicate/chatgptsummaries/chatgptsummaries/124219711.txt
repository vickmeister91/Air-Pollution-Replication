In a recent court order, the petitioner was granted permission to remove the name of the second opposite party from the case while still remaining a party by designation. The petitioner is facing charges under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for allegedly carrying tortoises in a truck of which he is the owner. However, the Ranger who lodged the complaint may not be competent to do so under Section 55 of the Act.

The court order also states that the State has accepted notice on behalf of the second opposite party. The case is to be put up again in four weeks for the filing of a counter affidavit.

The petitioner's request to remove the name of the second opposite party from the case was granted by the court. This means that the second opposite party will no longer be involved in the proceedings, but the petitioner will still be considered a party to the case.

The petitioner is facing charges under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for allegedly carrying tortoises in a truck of which he is the owner. The Act is designed to protect wildlife and their habitats, and carrying protected species without proper authorization is a violation of the law.

However, the court order notes that the Ranger who lodged the complaint may not be competent to do so under Section 55 of the Act. This section outlines the powers of Forest Officers and other authorized officers to investigate and prosecute offenses under the Act. If the Ranger is not authorized to do so, the charges against the petitioner may be called into question.

The State has accepted notice on behalf of the second opposite party, indicating that they are aware of the case and will be involved in the proceedings. The case is set to be put up again in four weeks for the filing of a counter affidavit.

The court order notes that the Ranger who lodged the complaint may not be competent to do so under Section 55 of the Act.
