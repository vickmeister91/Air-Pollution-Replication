In a recent court order, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to obtain certain documents. However, the application was rejected as the respondent stated that they did not possess the documents. The court disposed of the case, allowing the petitioner to raise any available grounds in their defense.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, the petitioner had filed an application under this section to obtain certain documents that they believed were necessary for their defense.

However, the respondent in this case stated that they did not possess the documents that the petitioner was seeking. As a result, the court rejected the petitioner's application under Section 91.

Despite the rejection of the application, the court did not completely dismiss the petitioner's case. Instead, the court disposed of the case, allowing the petitioner to raise any available grounds in their defense. This means that the petitioner can still argue their case and present any evidence or arguments that they believe will support their defense.

It is important to note that the court's decision to dispose of the case does not necessarily mean that the petitioner will be successful in their defense. The court simply allowed the petitioner to raise any available grounds in their defense, which means that the petitioner will still need to present a strong case in order to be successful.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in allowing parties to obtain necessary documents for their defense. However, it also shows that simply filing an application under this section does not guarantee success, as the respondent may not possess the documents that are being sought. Nonetheless, the court's decision to dispose of the case and allow the petitioner to raise any available grounds in their defense provides the petitioner with an opportunity to present their case and argue for their innocence.
