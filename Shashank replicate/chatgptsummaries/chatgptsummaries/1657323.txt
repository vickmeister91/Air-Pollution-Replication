The Supreme Court of India heard a public interest litigation filed by the Consumer Education & Research Centre and others regarding the protection of workers in asbestos industries. The court ordered various measures to be taken, including maintaining health records of workers, adopting the "MEMBRANE FILTER TEST," insuring employees, appointing a committee of experts to determine exposure limits, and providing medical examinations for workers exposed to asbestos. The court also referred to the Asbestos Convention of 1986 and the necessary measures for its enforcement.

The court order outlines the provisions of Article 21(1) which requires workers exposed to asbestos to receive necessary medical examinations to monitor their health and diagnose any occupational diseases caused by asbestos exposure. The monitoring should be free of charge, and workers have the right to be informed of the results of their medical examinations. The order also includes guidelines for exposure limits, monitoring strategies, and personal protection equipment. Specific procedures for encapsulation or removal of asbestos insulation are provided, including guidelines for dry and wet stripping. Rule 15.12 provides for stripping by high-pressure water.

The court order outlines safety guidelines for the use of asbestos, including the containment of slurry and high-pressure water jet stripping by trained personnel. The order also provides information on the pathology of asbestos-related diseases, including asbestosis and pleural thickening, and outlines diagnostic criteria for asbestosis. The order emphasizes the importance of adhering to safety rules and guidelines to prevent harm from asbestos exposure.

The court order discusses the diagnosis, sources of exposure, prevention, and treatment of asbestosis. It explains that asbestosis is primarily caused by occupational exposure to asbestos and that pleural plaques can arise at lower levels of exposure. The order also emphasizes the importance of medical surveillance for asbestos workers and the need for engineering control and dust control to prevent exposure. There is no specific treatment for asbestosis.

The court order discusses the prevalence of asbestosis and the lack of specific treatment for it. It also mentions the importance of removing those with evidence of asbestosis from further exposure and providing reassurance to those affected. The order also discusses compensation for asbestosis and the difficulty in determining the cause of lung cancer in those exposed to asbestos. The order cites epidemiological studies that confirm the link between asbestos exposure and an excess incidence of lung cancer, particularly in smokers. The order also notes that most "asbestos cancers of the lungs" could be prevented if workers did not smoke.

The court order discusses various studies that show a dose-response relationship between exposure to asbestos and the incidence of lung cancer. The order emphasizes the responsibility of employers and producers to provide protective measures to workers and the public who may be exposed to harmful consequences of their products. The order also highlights the importance of social justice and the Constitution's vision of ensuring a meaningful and dignified life for all citizens.

The court order states that the right to life includes the right to achieve self-expression of personality and enjoy life with dignity. The state must provide facilities and opportunities to reach a minimum standard of health, economic security, and civilized living. Social justice is a discipline of justice that relates to society, and the state must provide justice to all members of society. The right to health and medical care is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, and the state must take action to promote the health, strength, and vigor of workers during employment and leisure. Denial of the right to health violates Article 21, and the right to human dignity, development of personality, social protection, and rest and leisure are fundamental human rights. The court has previously directed industries to prevent pollution and ordered the closure of non-compliant industries. Private doctors and hospitals must extend services to protect the life of the patient.

The court order from (1989)4 SCC 286 states that private doctors or hospitals are directed to provide services to protect the life of the patient, whether they are innocent or criminal. The court also recognizes the importance of workers in a socialist society and their right to be heard before a company is closed. The court can give directions to employers to protect the right to life, prevent pollution, and protect the health of workers. The factories or companies are responsible for compensating workers for health hazards caused by their work. The court also directs the government to review standards and consider including small-scale factories in protecting workers' health. The writ petitions are allowed, and no costs are awarded.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India has issued a comprehensive court order to protect workers in asbestos industries. The order includes measures such as maintaining health records of workers, adopting the "MEMBRANE FILTER TEST," insuring employees, appointing a committee of experts to determine exposure limits, and providing medical examinations for workers exposed to asbestos. The court also outlines safety guidelines for the use of asbestos, including the containment of slurry and high-pressure water jet stripping by trained personnel.
