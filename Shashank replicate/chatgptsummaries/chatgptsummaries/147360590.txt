The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed appeals by Jal Mahal Resorts P. Ltd. against a judgment by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, which cancelled an Environment and Monument Improvement/Preservation and Tourism Development Project at Jaipur. The High Court declared the project illegal and directed the dismantling and removal of the entire project and diversion of two drains. The appellant was also directed to bear costs to restore the original position of 100 acres of land and remove sedimentation and settling tanks from the Mansagar Lake Basin. The State of Rajasthan withdrew its special leave petitions challenging the judgment and order of the High Court.

The project in question was aimed at restoring Mansagar Lake and Jal Mahal monument in Rajasthan, India, and developing the surrounding area for eco-friendly tourism. The project was to be carried out through a public-private partnership, with the state government committing to funding 30% of the restoration costs. After a failed first bid process, a second bid process was initiated, and the petitioner/appellant was awarded the project. The restoration of the lake was a cornerstone of the project, but due to inadequate funding from the government, the petitioner spent over Rs.15 crores on restoration. The project was carried out with the advice and monitoring of experts and government agencies.

The court order also discusses the restoration of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur, India. The project involved realigning drains and desilting the water body to prevent pollution. The court notes that all necessary environmental approvals were obtained for the restoration project, but there were issues with the tourism project's bidding process and eligibility requirements. The court order provides a detailed account of the history and current state of the lake and the various projects related to it.

Another dispute centered around the contention that the land leased to the appellant was wetland and that the lease was in contravention of the Wetland Rules and the Ramsar Convention. The court held that the lease was in violation of the Wetland Rules and could not be given effect to. The court also discusses a PIL petition against Jal Mahal Resorts Private Limited for constructing high walls of mud and soil in the eastern part of the lakebed near sluice gates and a large area around it for the purpose of preparing sedimentation tanks in the lake bed itself. The petitioner alleges that this has adversely affected the aesthetic value of the Mansagar Lake and has led to an increase in the chloride content of the lake, which will affect the lake's bio-diversity and both the native and migratory birds. The PIL petitioner also raises concerns about the lack of an Environment Impact Assessment and environmental clearance from the Central Government. The respondent State of Rajasthan argues that the lease of 100 acres of land to Jal Mahal Resorts Private Limited did not reduce the size of the lake.

The court order also discusses a dispute over the leasing of land for the Jal Mahal Tourism Project in Rajasthan, India. The state government and the lessee argue that the project is in the public interest and has been approved by expert bodies, while petitioners claim that it has caused ecological damage and encroached on public land. The court considers various legal and factual arguments, including the terms of the lease agreement, the environmental impact assessment, and the credentials of the winning bidder. Ultimately, the court finds that the project is valid and in the public interest, and dismisses the petitions.

The court order also pertains to a dispute over a project on the Mansagar Lake in Jaipur, India. The petitioner argued that the project was illegal because it did not receive sanction under the Wet Land Rules 2010 and sought a declaration of the Lease Deed being void. The court rejected this argument, stating that the Wet Land Rules 2010 only apply in situations where the Central Wet Land Authority sends its recommendation to the Central Government for notifying a certain area as a wetland. The court also noted that the Mansagar Lake is not a wetland under the Wet Land Rules 2010 and that the 100 acres leased land was not a part of the Lake Bed. The court also discussed the historical background of the lake and the purpose of the project to restore the Jal Mahal Monument.

The court order also discusses various contentions made by the appellant in a case related to the development of tourism in Jaipur. The appellant argues that the land leased to them for the project was designated for tourism purposes in the Jaipur Master Plan of 1976. They also contend that the hydrological modeling undertaken for the project scientifically determined a sustainable water level. The appellant further argues that the general conditions in the Environment Impact Assessment 2006 do not apply to their project. The court order also addresses the alleged violations of the Rajasthan Municipalities (Disposal of Urban Land) Rules 1974 and the Jaipur Development Authority Act 1982. The court ultimately concludes that the project is in alignment with the Jaipur Master Plan and that the JDA had the authority to allot land to the appellant for the purpose of implementing the plan.

In another dispute, the court found that the Jaipur Development Authority had the authority to allot land to the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation for implementing its master plan under the JDA Act 1982. The court found that the decision to award the project to the KGK Consortium was made in a transparent and bona fide manner, and that there was no mala fide in the decision-making process. The court also noted that previous
