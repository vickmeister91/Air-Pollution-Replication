The court order pertains to a dispute over the extraction of bamboo from reserved forests in India. The petitioner had requested directions from the court to issue necessary work orders for operating in the Langting West Region Coupe Nos. 7, 9 and 11 for extraction of bamboo and to issue necessary transit passes. The petitioner also requested the court to forebear from cancelling the settlement for extraction of bamboos granted in their favour in pursuance of the agreement dated 5-11-98. The petitioner's case was that the Divisional Forest Officer prevented them from extracting bamboos from Langting West area due to political pressure from the ruling party members of the NC Hills Autonomous Council.

The court was to decide whether the Council had jurisdiction to settle the three areas in the Reserved Forest in favour of the petitioner for extraction of bamboos under the agreement dated 5-11-98. The petitioner argued that the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution should be interpreted to allow for more autonomy to District Councils and Regional Councils, and that reserved forests should be entrusted to the Councils by the Governor. The respondent argued that the District Councils have no power to make laws with respect to reserved forests, and that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, prohibits the assignment of forest land without prior approval of the Central Government.

The court held that the Executive power of the District Councils in relation to reserved forests is subject to the provisions of the Constitution, law made by parliament, law made by the state Legislature, and the Assam Forest Regulation, 1891. The court also noted a dispute over the cancellation of an agreement for bamboo extraction, with the petitioner arguing that they were entitled to an opportunity to show cause before cancellation, and the respondent arguing that the agreement could not have been executed due to a pre-existing lease.

The court order stated that the petitioner had a settlement for extraction of bamboos granted in their favour under an agreement dated 5-11-98 with the Council. The HPC objected to the grant of three forest areas to the petitioner under the said agreement. The Council had not yet cancelled the agreement, but a show cause notice would be issued to the petitioner if they decided to cancel it. The court directed the Council to take a final decision on the matter within three months and until then, the petitioner could continue to operate the coupes in Hatikhali North and Hatikhali South as per the interim orders passed by the court. The parties would bear their respective costs.

In summary, the court order dealt with a dispute over the extraction of bamboo from reserved forests in India.
