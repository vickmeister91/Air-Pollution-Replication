The State of Maharashtra has filed an appeal against a judgment and order in which the respondent was acquitted of offenses related to possession of animal articles without valid permission. The prosecution's case was that the accused was in possession of tiger skin, teeth, and nails without permission and intended to sell them. The forest officer received information and arranged a trap, using a decoy to lure the accused to accompany them with the animal articles. The car was stopped by forest officers, and a search was conducted at a rest house where the animal articles were discovered in a suitcase.
