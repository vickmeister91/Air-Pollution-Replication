The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Jogendra Singh and others against their conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The applicants were found guilty of hunting wild animals and were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. The court rejected the applicants' defense that they reared pet pigs and found no infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the lower courts. The sentence imposed by the trial court was affirmed, and the revision was dismissed.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. The Act also provides for penalties for offenses related to wildlife, including hunting, poaching, and trafficking.

In this case, the applicants were convicted of hunting wild animals, which is a serious offense under the Act. The trial court found that the applicants had hunted wild animals in a forest area and had used firearms to do so. The court also found that the applicants had failed to produce any evidence to support their defense that they reared pet pigs. The trial court, therefore, sentenced the applicants to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each.

The applicants filed a criminal revision before the higher court, challenging their conviction and sentence. The applicants argued that they had not hunted any wild animals and that they had been falsely implicated in the case. The applicants also argued that they reared pet pigs and that the lower courts had failed to appreciate this fact.

The higher court, however, rejected the applicants' arguments and found no infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the lower courts. The court noted that the lower courts had relied on the testimony of eyewitnesses and had found the applicants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also noted that the applicants had failed to produce any evidence to support their defense that they reared pet pigs.

The court, therefore, affirmed the sentence imposed by the trial court and dismissed the revision filed by the applicants. The court's decision sends a strong message that offenses related to wildlife will not be tolerated and that those who engage in such activities will be punished severely.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Jogendra Singh and others against their conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The applicants were found guilty of hunting wild animals and were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. The court rejected the applicants' defense that they reared pet pigs and found no infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the lower courts. The sentence imposed by the trial court was affirmed, and the revision was dismissed. The court's decision underscores the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats and sends a strong message that those who engage in offenses related to wildlife will be punished severely.
