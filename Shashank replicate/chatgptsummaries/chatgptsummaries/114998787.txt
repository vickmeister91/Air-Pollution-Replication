The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bhupendra Singh, who was arrested for the illegal transportation of Chambal sand. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicant on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties. However, the court has also imposed certain conditions that the applicant must comply with.

One of the conditions is that the applicant must cooperate in the investigation/trial. This means that Bhupendra Singh must provide any information or evidence that may be required by the authorities during the course of the investigation or trial. Failure to do so may result in the revocation of his bail.

Another condition is that the applicant must not commit a similar offence. This means that Bhupendra Singh must refrain from engaging in any activity that may be considered illegal or criminal in nature. If he is found to have committed a similar offence, his bail may be revoked.

The court has also imposed a condition that the applicant must not leave India without prior permission of the trial court/Investigating Officer. This means that Bhupendra Singh must seek permission from the authorities before leaving the country. Failure to do so may result in the revocation of his bail.

It is important to note that the court has sent a copy of the order to the concerned court for compliance. This means that the order must be followed by all relevant authorities and that any violations may result in legal consequences.

Overall, the court order in question allows Bhupendra Singh to be released on bail, but with certain conditions that he must comply with. These conditions are designed to ensure that he cooperates with the investigation/trial, refrains from committing any similar offences, and does not leave the country without permission. The order must be followed by all relevant authorities to ensure compliance.
