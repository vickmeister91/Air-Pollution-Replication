The court recently issued an order in relation to a bail application filed by two individuals who were accused of killing wild pigs in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had administered poison to the animals and allowed them to be released on bail. However, the accused were required to cooperate with the investigation and appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays for two months or until the final report is filed. They were also required to execute a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000 each with two solvent sureties each for the like sum. The court made it clear that any violation of these conditions would result in the application for cancellation of bail.

The case in question pertains to the killing of wild pigs, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused were arrested and charged with the offence, and subsequently filed a bail application in court. The court examined the evidence presented before it and found that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had administered poison to the animals. Based on this finding, the court allowed the accused to be released on bail.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions on the accused in order to ensure that they cooperate with the investigation and do not abscond. The accused were required to appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays for two months or until the final report is filed. This condition ensures that the accused are available for questioning and do not evade the investigation. Additionally, the accused were required to execute a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000 each with two solvent sureties each for the like sum. This condition ensures that the accused have a financial stake in the case and are less likely to abscond.

The court made it clear that any violation of these conditions would result in the application for cancellation of bail. This means that if the accused fail to cooperate with the investigation or fail to appear before the Investigating Officer on the specified dates, their bail may be cancelled and they may be taken into custody again.

In conclusion, the court order in this case allows the accused to be released on bail, but imposes certain conditions to ensure that they cooperate with the investigation and do not abscond. The court's decision is based on a careful examination of the evidence presented before it, and the conditions imposed are designed to ensure that justice is served in the case.
