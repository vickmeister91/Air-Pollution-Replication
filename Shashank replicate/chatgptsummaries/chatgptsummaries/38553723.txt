In a recent court order, a petition filed by Arjun Agro Foods against the State of Punjab and others was dismissed. The petition challenged the revocation of the 'Consent to Establish' granted to the petitioner under the Water and Air Acts. The appellate authority found that the petitioner had submitted fake documents and did not meet the citing parameters. 

The petitioner had claimed that they had submitted all the necessary documents and had met all the parameters required for the grant of the 'Consent to Establish'. However, upon investigation, it was found that the petitioner had submitted fake and fabricated documents to support their claim. The appellate authority found that the petitioner had not met the necessary parameters and had therefore revoked the 'Consent to Establish'.

The petitioner then filed a petition in court challenging the decision of the appellate authority. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it was based on fake and fabricated documents and did not merit admission. The court found that the petitioner had not met the necessary parameters and had therefore not been granted the 'Consent to Establish' rightfully.
