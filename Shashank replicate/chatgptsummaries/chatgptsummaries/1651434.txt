On April 21, 2009, the Central Information Commission (CIC) heard two cases related to the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The first case involved Mr. J.B. Sharma, who had filed an RTI application with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) seeking information about a promotion and supersession matter. The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) directed him to deposit a sum of Rs.10/-, but he did not receive any information. The Appellate Authority did not reply to his appeal, so he filed a second appeal before the CIC.

The CIC directed the CPIO to provide the information admitted before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) by the Respondent within 20 days of the issue of the order. The CIC also noted that the Appellate Authority had failed to discharge its duties under the RTI Act and directed the ICMR to take appropriate action against the concerned officer.

In the second case, Mr. Rajesh Debroy had filed an RTI application with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) seeking information about the type of organization CPCB officially falls under. The CPIO had replied to his application, but the Appellant was not satisfied and filed an appeal. The Appellate Authority also replied, but the Appellant was still not satisfied and filed a second appeal before the CIC.

The CIC found that all available information had been provided to the Appellant and rejected the appeal. The CIC also noted that the Appellant had not provided any specific reasons for seeking the information and had not established any larger public interest in the matter.

The court order lists the names and addresses of several individuals and organizations, including Mr. J.S. Kamyoutra, the Appellate Authority and Member Secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board, and the Officer in charge of NIC. It also mentions the Press E Group of CIC.

Overall, these cases highlight the importance of the RTI Act in ensuring transparency and accountability in government institutions. The CIC's orders in these cases demonstrate its commitment to upholding the principles of the RTI Act and ensuring that public authorities are held accountable for their actions.
