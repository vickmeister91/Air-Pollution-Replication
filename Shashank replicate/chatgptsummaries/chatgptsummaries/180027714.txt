In a recent court order, the applicants-accused who were in custody since 06.10.2018 for hunting a wild pig and violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, have been granted bail. The court allowed the bail application filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- each with one solvent surety each in the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for their appearance on all dates fixed in the case.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violation of this act is a serious offense and can lead to imprisonment and hefty fines.

In this case, the applicants-accused were found guilty of hunting a wild pig, which is a clear violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. They were taken into custody on 06.10.2018 and have been in custody since then. However, the court has now granted them bail, allowing them to be released from custody.

The bail application was filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., which allows for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the course of an investigation or trial. The court has considered the application and has granted bail to the applicants-accused.

As a condition of their bail, the court has directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- each with one solvent surety each in the same amount. This means that they will have to provide a guarantee that they will appear in court on all dates fixed in the case. The surety will also have to provide a guarantee that they will pay the bail amount if the applicants fail to appear in court.

The court has emphasized the importance of the applicants' appearance in court on all dates fixed in the case. This is because the case involves a serious offense and the applicants' presence in court is crucial for the proper conduct of the trial.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to the applicants-accused who were in custody since 06.10.2018 for hunting a wild pig and violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has allowed the bail application filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. and has directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- each with one solvent surety each in the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for their appearance on all dates fixed in the case. The court has emphasized the importance of their appearance in court and has made it a condition of their bail.
