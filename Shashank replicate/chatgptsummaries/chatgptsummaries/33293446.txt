The Karnataka High Court issued an order on February 12, 2015, in a writ petition filed by J.S. Jagadish against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and others. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Karnataka State Appellate Authority. The court was informed that the respondent No. 4 was directed to close the industrial operation or process until further orders due to air and noise pollution. 

The case was related to the issue of air and noise pollution caused by an industrial unit. The petitioner had approached the court seeking to quash an order passed by the Karnataka State Appellate Authority, which had directed the closure of the industrial unit until further orders. The respondent No. 4 was the owner of the industrial unit, which was causing air and noise pollution in the area.

During the hearing, the court was informed that the industrial unit had been causing significant air and noise pollution in the area, which was adversely affecting the health and well-being of the residents. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had issued several notices to the respondent No. 4, directing them to take necessary measures to control the pollution caused by the industrial unit. However, the respondent No. 4 had failed to comply with the directions of the Pollution Control Board.

The court observed that the right to a clean and healthy environment was a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court also noted that the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, had been enacted to prevent and control air pollution in the country. The court held that the respondent No. 4 had violated the provisions of the Act by causing air and noise pollution in the area.

The court disposed of the petition with no order as to cost after the respondent No. 4 agreed not to restart the unit without obtaining an express order of consent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court directed the respondent No. 4 to take all necessary measures to control the pollution caused by the industrial unit and to comply with the directions of the Pollution Control Board.

The court's order was a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that the right to a clean and healthy environment was upheld. The court's decision to dispose of the petition with no order as to cost was a clear indication that the court was serious about enforcing the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and ensuring that the industrial units complied with the directions of the Pollution Control Board.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's order in the writ petition filed by J.S. Jagadish against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and others was a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that the right to a clean and healthy environment was upheld. The court's decision to dispose of the petition with no order as to cost was a clear indication that the court was serious about enforcing the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and ensuring that the industrial units complied with the directions of the Pollution Control Board. The court's order was a reminder to all industrial units that they must take necessary measures to control pollution and comply with the directions of the Pollution Control Board to ensure that the right to a clean and healthy environment is upheld.
