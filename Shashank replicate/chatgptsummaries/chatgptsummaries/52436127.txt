The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to incidents that occurred at the National Zoological Park in New Delhi, India. In the first court order, the legal representatives of a man who died at the zoo filed a writ petition alleging negligence on the part of the zoo authorities. The court was asked to grant compensation to the petitioners, and cited previous rulings that allowed for monetary compensation in appropriate cases where it was the only mode of redress available. The court also noted that there were no limitations on its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution.

The second court order discussed the duty of the court to enforce the law and mete out justice in cases where workmen are engaged in violation of the law or continued as contract labor despite prohibition. The court also noted that in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate all those affected by the accident. The liability of the respondent in the case of injury or death of a visitor to the zoo can be based on negligence, liability as keeper of dangerous animals, or liability as occupier of the premises. The duty of the zoo authorities is to ensure that wild animals are kept and confined in such a manner that they are incapable of causing damage or injury to visitors.

The third court order stated that the occupier of a premises, such as a zoo, is responsible for ensuring the safety of visitors and taking necessary precautions to prevent injury. The court also noted that statutory regulations require zoos to ensure the safety of visitors and provide appropriate barriers to prevent contact with dangerous animals. The court examined a specific incident where a child fell into a tiger enclosure and was killed, and found that the zoo failed in its duty to ensure visitor safety. The court also noted that the zoo has taken steps to improve safety measures since the incident.

The fourth court order outlined steps taken by the National Zoological Park to enhance visitor security, including providing emergency equipment, increasing security guards, and conducting workshops and mock drills. However, the court found that there were serious gaps in precautions and protocols, leading to the death of a visitor who fell into a moat containing a tiger. The court held the zoo liable for compensation under the principles of strict and absolute liability, awarding Rs. 6 lacs to the victim's family. The money will be deposited in court and distributed to the family members, with a portion kept in a fixed deposit for the victim's newborn daughter.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of ensuring visitor safety at zoos and other premises where hazardous or inherently dangerous activities take place. The courts have wide powers to award compensation in appropriate cases, and it is the duty of the occupier of the premises to take necessary precautions to prevent injury. While the National Zoological Park has taken steps to improve safety measures, serious gaps in precautions and protocols can still lead to tragic incidents, and the courts will hold the occupier of the premises liable for compensation under the principles of strict and absolute liability.
