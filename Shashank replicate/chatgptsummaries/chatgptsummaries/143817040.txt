The Supreme Court of India recently passed two orders in cases related to criminal trials. The first order pertains to a special leave petition filed by Dr. Rajesh Talwar and his wife, who are being tried for the murder of their daughter and domestic helper. The petitioners had filed an application under Section 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking documents pertaining to scientific tests made on three persons who were earlier suspected of the offence. The trial court had allowed the application partly, but the High Court rejected it on the ground that it was vexatious and intended to delay the proceedings. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the reports were essential for their defence.

The Supreme Court found no merit in the petitioners' contention and observed that criminal courts are not obliged to entertain and allow applications for additional evidence if they are made to vex the proceedings or delay the same. The court also noted that the trial judge was likely to retire soon. The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle that criminal trials should not be delayed unnecessarily and that the courts have the power to prevent dilatory tactics by the accused.

The second order discusses a case where the accused had moved applications under section 233 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The trial court had dismissed one of the applications, and the accused had filed another application for disclosure statements. The petitioners had also moved an application for summoning witnesses. The court refers to the importance of fair trial and the duty of the courts to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. The court notes that the petitioners had been adopting dilatory tactics and dismisses the special leave petition.

The court's decision in this case is also significant as it emphasizes the importance of fair trial and the duty of the courts to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. The court's observation that the petitioners had been adopting dilatory tactics is a reminder that the accused should not be allowed to delay the trial unnecessarily. The court's decision also highlights the need for the courts to be vigilant in preventing the misuse of legal procedures by the accused.

In both cases, the Supreme Court has upheld the principle that criminal trials should not be delayed unnecessarily and that the courts have the power to prevent dilatory tactics by the accused. The court's decisions are a reminder that the accused should not be allowed to misuse legal procedures to delay the trial and that the courts have a duty to ensure a fair trial and maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.
