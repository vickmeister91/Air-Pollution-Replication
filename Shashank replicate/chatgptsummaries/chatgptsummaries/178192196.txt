The court rejected the petitioner's application, stating that it was an attempt to stall the proceedings and that the call details were not necessary for a fair trial. However, the court allowed the accused to renew their prayer for calling the entire call details if new facts were brought on record during the evidence of the nodal officer of the service provider.

The case in question involves serious allegations of rape and sexual assault against the petitioner and other accused. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning call details of two mobile numbers, which he claimed were relevant to the case. However, the court rejected the application, stating that it was an attempt to stall the proceedings and that the call details were not necessary for a fair trial.

The court observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for summoning the call details and that the application was filed with the sole intention of delaying the trial. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any specific reasons for why the call details were necessary for a fair trial and that the application was vague and general in nature.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the call details through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the service provider or by seeking the assistance of the investigating agency. The court noted that the petitioner had not even provided the phone numbers in question, which made it difficult for the court to assess the relevance of the call details.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not explained how the call details were relevant to the case and how they would assist in establishing his innocence. The court noted that the petitioner had not even provided any specific dates or time periods for which the call details were required, which made it difficult for the court to assess the relevance of the call details.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not explained how the call details would be authenticated and how their authenticity would be established in court. The court observed that the petitioner had not even provided any details about the service provider or the nodal officer who would be responsible for providing the call details.

In light of these observations, the court rejected the petitioner's application and observed that it was an attempt to stall the proceedings. However, the court allowed the accused to renew their prayer for calling the entire call details if new facts were brought on record during the evidence of the nodal officer of the service provider.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of providing specific and relevant information when seeking the summoning of call details in a criminal case. The court has made it clear that vague and general applications will not be entertained and that the relevance of the call details must be established in a clear and specific manner.

The court's decision also highlights the need for accused persons to make every effort to obtain relevant evidence through other means before seeking the summoning of call details. Accused persons must demonstrate that they have made every effort to obtain the evidence through other means and that the call details are necessary for a fair trial.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the summoning of call details in a criminal case must be based on specific and relevant information and that vague and general applications will not be entertained. Accused persons must make every effort to obtain relevant evidence through other means before seeking the summoning of call details.
