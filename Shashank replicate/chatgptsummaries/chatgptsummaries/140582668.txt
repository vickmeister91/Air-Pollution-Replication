The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of a village in Gujarat, India, against a stone crushing unit that was causing environmental pollution. The petitioners sought the quashing of an order allowing the unit to restart operations, cancellation of the mining lease, and a direction to the authorities not to allow the unit to operate pending the disposal of the petition. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a dispute over a stone crushing unit operated by respondent Nos. 6 to 8. The petitioners argued that the unit was causing pollution and health hazards to the surrounding area, while the respondents argued that they were operating within the prescribed distance from residential areas and had obtained necessary permissions. The court found that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board had ignored the Supreme Court's decision that a safe distance between a crushing unit and residential locality should be 1 km. The court also noted that there was no unified policy or guidelines from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board regarding the distance to be maintained from residential areas. The court ordered the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to plan a comprehensive program for the prevention, control, or abatement of air pollution and to secure execution thereof.

The court order states that the Central Government can give directions to any person, officer, or authority under the Air Act. The Board has the power to issue directions to comply with the Act, including the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry or operation. The Board must frame guidelines for granting permission to start quarry operation units, considering factors such as air and water quality, pollution concentration, emission or discharge of pollutants, topography, biodiversity, land-use, and adverse environmental impact. The court emphasizes the right to life, including the right to live in a pollution-free environment. The court acknowledges the need for industrial development but also stresses the importance of protecting the environment. The court cites previous cases and observations on the urgent need to address environmental deterioration and the extinction of species.

The court order discusses the issue of environmental deterioration in Indian cities and the government's responsibility to protect and improve the environment. The court cites constitutional obligations and directives to safeguard forests, wildlife, and the natural environment. The court also discusses the limitations on the right to carry on business, particularly in inherently dangerous industries that pose a threat to public health and safety. The court ultimately quashes an order permitting quarry operations near a residential area and issues directions to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to regulate the crushing of stones. The court refuses a request to stay the order.
