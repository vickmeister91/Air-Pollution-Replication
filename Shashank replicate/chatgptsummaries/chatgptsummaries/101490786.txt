The Patna High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to four criminal writ jurisdiction cases filed by Mithilesh Kumar Singh against various government officials and departments in Bihar. Singh is the director of Broad Son Commodities Pvt. Ltd. and is seeking relief from charges filed against him in different police stations in Patna. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued an oral judgment on August 26, 2019.

The four writ petitions involve identical facts and questions of law. Singh is a director of a company accused of illegal sand mining in violation of various laws. He seeks to quash the FIR against him, arguing that excess mining is not illegal mining and that the jurisdictional magistrate cannot take cognizance of any offense under certain Acts and Rules without a complaint filed by a person authorized on behalf of the government. Singh also argues that the ingredients of the offenses under Sections 379, 406, and 420 of the IPC are not attracted. The State argues that the allegations made in the FIR are clear and that Singh cannot escape liability for the offenses.

The court order states that Singh, who is a director of a company that excavated excess sand from sand ghats in violation of the terms and conditions of the agreement, is liable to be prosecuted for theft of state revenue. The court also notes that excess mining is a civil wrong and not illegal mining, and that the company had a valid license for mining sand in the district of Patna. The court concludes that the offense punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be attracted in this case.

In another part of the court order, the court states that the company is authorized to mine sand in the district of Patna and therefore, the offense punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be applicable. The court also explains that for an offense alleging violation of any provisions of the MMDR Act or any rules made thereunder, an FIR cannot be instituted rather a complaint in writing has to be made by a person authorized in this behalf. The court also discusses the definition of 'complaint' and explains that an FIR cannot be treated as a complaint. The court further explains that the jurisdictional court can take cognizance of any offense under the MMDR Act or the rules made thereunder only upon a written complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C filed by a person authorized in this behalf. The court also discusses the offense punishable under Section 379 of the IPC and explains that in absence of any allegation that the Company excavated sand in a clandestine manner with an intent to remove mineral dishonestly, the offense punishable under Section 379 of the IPC would not be attracted against it.

The court order also states that in cases of theft of sand and gravel from government land, the police can investigate and submit a report to a magistrate for taking cognizance against the accused. However, if a person has a valid license or lease for excavation, excess mining cannot be considered theft. The court also states that vicarious liability is not recognized in criminal law, and a person cannot be charged for an offense committed by a company unless the company is also accused. The court also notes that the informant in the case, a mining inspector, is not authorized to file a complaint under the Environment (Protection) Act, and the FIR filed under Section 15 of the Act is invalid.

In summary, the court order issued by the Patna High Court pertains to four criminal writ jurisdiction cases filed by Mithilesh Kumar Singh against various government officials and departments in Bihar. Singh is seeking relief from charges filed against him in different police stations in Patna. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued an oral judgment on August 26, 2019. The court order discusses the legality of excess sand mining and the applicability of various Acts and Rules.

The court also notes that vicarious liability is not recognized in criminal law and that a person cannot be charged for an offense committed by a company unless the company is also accused. Overall, the court order provides important insights into the legal framework surrounding sand mining in Bihar.
