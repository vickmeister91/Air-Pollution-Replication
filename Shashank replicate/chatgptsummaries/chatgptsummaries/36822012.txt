The court order in question pertains to a public interest litigation case involving Dattatraya Hari Mane and others versus the State of Maharashtra and others, as well as several related civil applications. The case centers around the pollution of the Panchaganga River due to untreated sewage water from Kolhapur and Ichalkaranji cities, as well as other factors. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Municipal Corporation of City of Kolhapur, and Municipal Council of Ichalkaranji are named as respondents.

The court cites Article 48A of the Constitution of India, which states that the state shall protect and improve the environment, and Article 51A, which outlines the fundamental duties of citizens to protect and improve the natural environment. The court applies the public trust doctrine, stating that the state is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment. The court emphasizes that the state has a legal duty to protect natural resources, which are meant for public use and cannot be converted into private ownership. The conflict between preserving natural resources and administrative responsibilities is for the legislature to resolve, but in the absence of legislation, the executive cannot abdicate natural resources and convert them for private or commercial use.

The court also recognizes the importance of the public trust doctrine in protecting natural resources as public properties. The Constitution of India imposes a duty on the state to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife, and every citizen has a fundamental duty to protect and improve the natural environment. The court has repeatedly invoked these articles to protect the environment and ecology in public interest litigation.

The petition alleges that the fourth respondent corporation discharges untreated sewage water into the river, and the fifth respondent council is not implementing the provisions of the Water Act. The main prayer is to direct the respondents to stop releasing untreated sewage water into the river and take steps to prevent pollution. The court has appointed NEERI to make a study and submit a report.

The court has ordered immediate protective and remedial action to be taken regarding pollution in the Panchaganga river. NEERI has been appointed to make a comprehensive report on all issues relating to pollution, identify causes, suggest remedial measures, and opine on the technical capability of current projects. All parties must furnish any information NEERI requires, and NEERI is entitled to seek information from any relevant party. The costs and fees of NEERI will be paid equally by the fourth and fifth respondents. The court has taken on record a project report submitted by NEERI and preliminary recommendations and a supplementary action plan for abatement of Panchaganga river. The court finds no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the interim and final recommendations of NEERI must be implemented due to the magnitude of pollution in the river.

The court order addresses pollution in the Panchaganga River caused by various sources, including cities, citizens, industries, and villages. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has prepared an action plan to prevent pollution, but the fourth respondent (Kolhapur Municipal Corporation) has not adhered to the plan or complied with previous directions issued under the Water Act and other regulations. The MPCB has outlined specific proposals for the fourth respondent to follow, including upgrading sewage treatment plants and trapping untreated sewage. The court will issue interim directions subject to further guidance from the court.

The court order discusses the failure of the Municipal Corporation and Municipal Council to comply with directions issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to prevent untreated sewage water from being discharged into the Panchaganga River. The MPCB has issued various directions, including the construction of a Solid Waste Processing Plant and the diversion of Nallas to prevent untreated sewage water from being discharged into the river. The affidavit states that the fourth Respondent Corporation is generating 96 MLD of sewage out of which only 43.5 MLD of sewage is being given primary treatment. The contribution of the fourth Respondent Corporation to the pollution of the river is 52%, and the contribution of the fifth Respondent is 23%. The court has issued directions to complete the construction of STPs and lift sewage within a specified time limit.

The court order requires the lifting arrangement to be made within 45 days to prevent domestic effluent from being discharged into the Panchganga river. The Ichalkaranji Municipal Council has been directed to operate and maintain existing STP and provide a new one. The MPCB has proposed action against industries contributing to the pollution of the river. NEERI has submitted a report with recommendations for the protection of the river and the health of the population. The local authorities have accepted the recommendations in principle, but there is some dispute over their implementation.

The court order discusses the need for long-term measures to prevent pollution and rejuvenate the Panchaganga River. The court notes that there is some dispute over whether recommendations to address the pollution have been implemented. The court also references a previous case in which the MPCB and Kolhapur Municipal Corporation were issued directions to monitor pollution levels and prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the river. The court order emphasizes the need for all concerned agencies to take steps to address the pollution.

The court order requires various statutory agencies, including the State Government, to prevent pollution to the Panchaganga River. The agencies must implement a comprehensive plan based on the recommendations of NEERI, an expert agency. Citizens also have a role to play in preventing
