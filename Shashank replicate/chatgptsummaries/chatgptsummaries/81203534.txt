The issue of noise pollution caused by sound-producing instruments in the state of Punjab, India, was brought to the attention of the court through a letter from a resident of a village in Punjab. The letter complained about the loud noise from religious functions and DJ music that continued until midnight, causing inconvenience to the public and children. The court treated the letter as a Public Interest Litigation and issued notices to the State of Punjab.

The District Magistrate of Amritsar stated that there are laws in place to control noise pollution and that instructions have been issued to control the use of loudspeakers and other instruments. The court also received an affidavit from the Additional Secretary to the Government of Punjab, stating that an Expert Committee has been formed to comply with the court's directions to avoid noise pollution. The committee has prescribed noise limits for vehicles, domestic appliances, and construction equipment.

The court order outlines various noise limits and regulations for different types of equipment and vehicles, including generator sets, motor vehicles, and sound producing instruments. The Environment (Protection) Rules 1986 and Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 are referenced, as well as the Punjab Instruments (Control of Noises) Act, 1956. The court notes the recommendations of an expert committee, which suggests that the noise generated from any musical or sound producing instrument should not exceed 55 dBA and that regulations regarding noise from such instruments should be framed at the national level.

The court directs the state to comply with national standards for noise regulations and ensure compliance with rules framed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also directs the state to pursue recommendations made by an expert committee and take effective measures to control noise generated by musical instruments or sound-producing instruments. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is directed to take necessary steps to regulate noise pollution. The state is required to file compliance reports periodically and ensure compliance with directions issued by the Supreme Court regarding noise pollution.

The court closes the public interest litigation with these directions and observations. The court's order is a significant step towards controlling noise pollution caused by sound-producing instruments in the state of Punjab. The court's directions to comply with national standards and pursue recommendations made by an expert committee will help in reducing noise pollution and its harmful effects on public health. The state's compliance with the court's directions and periodic filing of compliance reports will ensure that noise pollution is effectively controlled in the state. The Ministry of Environment and Forests' role in regulating noise pollution is also crucial in ensuring that noise pollution is controlled at the national level. 

In conclusion, the court's order is a positive step towards controlling noise pollution caused by sound-producing instruments in the state of Punjab. The court's directions to comply with national standards and pursue recommendations made by an expert committee will help in reducing noise pollution and its harmful effects on public health.
