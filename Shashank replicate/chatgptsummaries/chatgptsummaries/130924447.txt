The High Court of Punjab and Haryana, at Chandigarh, issued a court order on July 4, 2013, in response to ten civil writ petitions challenging the actions of the Union of India, State of Haryana, and others. The court order pertains to various issues related to mining activities and environmental clearance in the region.

In one of the writ petitions, the petitioners challenged the State of Haryana's decision to auction land blocks for the extraction of minor minerals without clearance from the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India. The court cited a previous case where restrictions and prohibitions were imposed on new projects/activities based on their potential environmental impacts. The court directed that the lands/areas under the notification of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, shall not be used for non-forest purposes, including mining of major or minor minerals. The court also upheld the applicability of the Notification dated 14.9.2006 issued by the Central Government in respect of mining activities.

Another court order prohibited mining activity in the Shivalik ranges of Himalayas without prior environmental clearance. The State of Haryana and the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee were directed to enforce the notification dated 14.9.2006 and monitor mining operations regularly. The notification was also directed to be applied to mining areas where activities were undertaken prior to its issuance. The State of Haryana was directed to apply to the Expert Appraisal Committee for determining the Terms of Reference and get the Environment Impact Assessment Report prepared for the entire mining area. No public auction shall be held until the final Environment Impact Assessment Report is prepared and made available as a public document to the prospective bidders. Successful bidders shall apply for prior environmental clearance within one month from the date of auction. The government of Haryana shall be entitled to recover the expenditure incurred by it in compliance with the Central Govt. notification dated 14.9.2006.

In another writ petition, the court order pertained to a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Union of India, which imposes conditions to stop environmental pollution. The order directed the Expert Appraisal Committee to prepare the final Environment Impact Assessment Report within six months and grant or reject the 'prior environmental clearance' within two months. The mining activities may continue till 28th February 2010, only on the basis of the contract/licence granted to the highest bidders through a transparent 'public auction' held after wide publicity and subject to the terms and conditions. The State of Haryana shall not stand absolved of its legal obligation on mere successful accomplishment of the Fourth Stage enumerated in the Central Govt. notification dated 14.9.2006.

The court order in another writ petition stated that a controversy similar to the case at hand is pending before the Supreme Court, and it would be appropriate to wait for the outcome of that case. The court also mentioned a previous judgment in Vijay Bansal's case, which gave clear and cogent directions that the court will follow. The State of Haryana filed an application for an extension of time to comply with the judgment, but it was rejected. The court also noted that the State of Haryana has no authority to auction blocks for mining without obtaining necessary environmental clearance. The court directed all states, Union Territories, MoEF, and the Ministry of Mines to implement the recommendations made by MoEF in its report of March 2010 and the model guidelines framed.

In yet another writ petition, the court order required the Ministry of Mines to submit compliance reports within six months and for the Central Government to enforce the Minor Minerals Conservation and Development Rules 2010. State Governments and UTs were also required to frame necessary rules under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Leases for minor minerals can only be granted by States/Union Territories after obtaining environmental clearance from the MoEF. The order should be communicated to various departments and the concerned Chief Secretaries.

In another writ petition, the court order stated that any projects or activities listed in Category 'A' or 'B' in the Schedule, including expansion, modernization, or change in product mix, require prior environmental clearance from the Central Government or State/Union territory Environment Impact Assessment Authority. An Expert Appraisal Committee will be constituted for this purpose. The application for prior environmental clearance must be made in the prescribed Form 1 and Supplementary Form 1A, along with a copy of the pre-feasibility project report. The environmental clearance process for new projects will comprise a maximum of four stages, including screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal. The Schedule lists projects or activities requiring prior environmental clearance, with specific conditions and exemptions.

Finally, in another writ petition, the court order pertained to a case involving the auction of land blocks for extracting minor minerals. The court quashed notices dated 14.8.2012 and allowed all the writ petitions. The court stated that after allotment of the land blocks, it is for the lessee/project proponent to get environmental clearance. The court also clarified that the State Government will act as a project proponent, not the lessee. The State Authorities were granted liberty to apply for environmental clearance as per the directions issued in Vijay Bansal's case or approach the Supreme Court for necessary directions/clarifications.

In summary, the court orders issued by the High Court of Punjab
