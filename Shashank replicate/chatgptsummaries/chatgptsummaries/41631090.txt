The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently reviewed a case where the Punjab Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against M/S B.S. International and others for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the complaint was dismissed due to a delay of three days in filing a revision petition. The petitioner argued that the delay was not significant and that the revision petition should have been decided on its merits. The court agreed with the petitioner and stated that the technicalities of law should not override substantive justice.

The court exercised its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside the impugned order and prevent the abuse of process of law. The court held that the delay of three days was not significant enough to dismiss the revision petition and that the case should be decided on its merits. The court further stated that the purpose of the law is to ensure justice and not to create technicalities that can be used to defeat justice.

In another case, the court found the order passed by the Sessions Judge to be illegal and set it aside. The petitioner's application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was allowed, and the delay in filing the revision petition was condoned. The matter was remitted back to the Sessions Judge for a fresh decision on the merits of the case. The Sessions Judge was directed to make an effort to decide the case within three months from the date of receipt of the order.

The court's decision in this case was based on the principle that justice should not be denied due to technicalities. The court held that the delay in filing the revision petition was not significant enough to dismiss the case and that the petitioner should be given an opportunity to present their case on its merits. The court further directed the Sessions Judge to decide the case within three months to ensure that justice is not delayed.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of substantive justice over technicalities of law. The court exercised its inherent jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of process of law and ensure that justice is not denied due to technicalities. The court's decision in these cases is a reminder that the purpose of the law is to ensure justice and not to create technicalities that can be used to defeat justice.
