The court order in question pertains to the case of Jamal Iqbal and Danish Damal, who had been in custody since May 9, 2015, for a forest crime case. The applicants had sought bail, claiming that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that their arrest was baseless. The court allowed their bail application, directing them to furnish a bond of Rs. 35,000 each and one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.

The case of Jamal Iqbal and Danish Damal had been ongoing for some time, with the two men being held in custody for over a year. The forest crime case that they were accused of had been a contentious issue, with many people in the area feeling that the charges were baseless and that the men had been unfairly targeted. The applicants had maintained their innocence throughout the proceedings, and had argued that they were being held without cause.

In light of these circumstances, the court's decision to grant bail to the two men was seen as a significant victory. The court had taken into account the fact that the applicants were reputed citizens with no criminal past, and had found that their arrest was indeed baseless. The court had also noted that the men had been held in custody for an extended period of time, and that this had caused them significant hardship.

The court's decision to grant bail was not without conditions, however. The applicants were directed to furnish a bond of Rs. 35,000 each and one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This was seen as a reasonable requirement, given the seriousness of the charges against the men. The court had also made it clear that the order would be effective until the end of the trial, but that in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Jamal Iqbal and Danish Damal was seen as a positive development in the ongoing forest crime case. The men had been held in custody for an extended period of time, and their release on bail was seen as a step towards justice. The court's decision to impose conditions on their release was also seen as reasonable, given the seriousness of the charges against them. It remains to be seen how the trial will proceed, but for now, the applicants can take some comfort in the fact that they are no longer being held in custody.
