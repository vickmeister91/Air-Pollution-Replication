The case in question involved a petitioner who challenged an order of discharge from the Bihar State Pollution Control Board, as well as the rejection of his appeal against it. The main charge against him was that he had entered the chambers of a regional officer and pressured him to issue a certificate of experience. The petitioner denied the allegations, and it was found that only one charge was referred to the Enquiry Officer for enquiry, but eight charges were taken into consideration by the Chairman of the Board.

Upon review, the court found that the order of discharge was without jurisdiction and set it aside, remitting the case to the Board to take a fresh decision in accordance with the law. The petitioner was given liberty to file a fresh show cause reply, and the respondents were directed to accept his joining on reinstatement. However, the court did not make a decision on arrears of salary.

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and ensuring that all charges are considered in a fair and just manner. The court's decision to set aside the order of discharge and remit the case to the Board for a fresh decision emphasizes the need for due process and adherence to the law.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision to give the petitioner the opportunity to file a fresh show cause reply and be reinstated demonstrates the importance of providing individuals with the chance to defend themselves and have their case heard. This is a fundamental aspect of justice and fairness, and the court's decision reflects this.

Overall, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and ensuring that all charges are considered in a fair and just manner.
