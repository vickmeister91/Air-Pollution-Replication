The Rajasthan High Court recently received multiple petitions from stone crusher owners who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court had previously allowed the owners to appear before the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board to address the issues, but the Board refused to grant consent to operate to the petitioners. The Board also issued orders to close the units, leading to the owners filing petitions before the court.

The Board argued that the owners had an alternate remedy available to them, but the owners claimed that the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the Board had the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution. However, the court also noted that the orders issued by the Board were non-speaking orders and violated principles of natural justice. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration.

The court order discusses the powers of the State Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The order also addresses the distinction between orders and directions, and the right to file an appeal against them. The petitioners in the case argue that the Board violated the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The Board argues that it was justified in its actions and cites a similar case where the court upheld its decision. The court ultimately finds that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court and that the case is not identical to the cited case.

In another case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, the Board had issued an order to close down the stone crusher units due to non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court found that the Board did not follow the proper procedure for granting or renewing consent to operate, and the notice given to the stone crusher units was vague and unclear. The court also noted that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for conducting an inquiry and giving an opportunity of hearing to the concerned parties. Therefore, the court declared the Board's orders to be legally unsustainable.

In yet another case, a stone crusher company was found to be lacking in pollution control measures. The State Board refused to renew their consent to operate due to this. However, the court found that the Board did not follow proper procedures and violated principles of natural justice. The court quashed the Board's orders and directed them to consider the company's application for renewal within four months, issue a temporary consent for one month, inspect the site, and collect air samples. The court also directed the state government to form a committee to advise on declaring areas as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has been dealing with multiple cases involving stone crusher owners and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The court has found that the Board did not follow proper procedures and violated principles of natural justice in some cases. The court has quashed the Board's orders and directed them to reconsider the matter in light of the court's findings. The court has also ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The court's orders have been sent to the Chief Secretary for immediate implementation.
