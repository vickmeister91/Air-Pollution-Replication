The Patna High Court recently passed an order in two writ petitions challenging the Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1984. The petitioners had challenged the vires of the Act, but the only point argued was that the Act did not apply to any area in Bihar as no notification under Section 1(c) had been published. The State Government had issued a notification under Section 1(d) of the Act, but it did not specify the area to which the provisions of the Act shall apply.

The court held that there was no material on record to show that notification under Section 1(c) of the Act had been published applying the Act to any area of Bihar. Consequently, the respondents could not claim that there was a bar or restriction on the purchase, transport, import or export of specified forest produce in Bihar. The respondents were restrained from interfering with the trade in forest produce by the petitioners until notification under Section 1(c) was issued. The court directed the respondents to release the forest produce seized from the petitioners.

The Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1984, was enacted to regulate the trade in forest produce in the state of Bihar. The Act provides for the regulation of the purchase, sale, transport, and storage of forest produce. It also provides for the establishment of a Forest Produce Trade Committee to regulate the trade in forest produce.

The Act has been challenged on the ground that it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) and 301 of the Constitution of India. Article 19(1)(g) guarantees the right to practice any profession, occupation, or trade, while Article 301 guarantees the freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout the territory of India.

The petitioners had argued that the Act imposes unreasonable restrictions on the trade in forest produce and violates their fundamental rights. They had also argued that the Act was arbitrary and discriminatory as it did not apply to the entire state of Bihar.

The court, however, did not go into the constitutional validity of the Act as the only point argued was that the Act did not apply to any area in Bihar as no notification under Section 1(c) had been published. The court held that there was no material on record to show that notification under Section 1(c) of the Act had been published applying the Act to any area of Bihar.

The court also held that the respondents could not claim that there was a bar or restriction on the purchase, transport, import or export of specified forest produce in Bihar as there was no notification under Section 1(c) of the Act. Consequently, the respondents were restrained from interfering with the trade in forest produce by the petitioners until notification under Section 1(c) was issued.

The court directed the respondents to release the forest produce seized from the petitioners. The court's order is significant as it clarifies that the Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1984, does not apply to any area in Bihar as no notification under Section 1(c) has been published.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's recent order in two writ petitions challenging the Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1984, clarifies that the Act does not apply to any area in Bihar as no notification under Section 1(c) has been published. The court's order is significant as it restrains the respondents from interfering with the trade in forest produce by the petitioners until notification under Section 1(c) is issued. The court's order also directs the respondents to release the forest produce seized from the petitioners.
