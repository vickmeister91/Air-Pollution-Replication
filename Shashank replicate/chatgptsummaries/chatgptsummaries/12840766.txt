In a recent court case, the petitioner, Mariyappan, filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash a summon issued by the 1st respondent under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court heard both parties and the learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) submitted that the prayer sought for has become infructuous. Therefore, the petition was dismissed as infructuous and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed.

The case involved a petition filed by Mariyappan, who sought to quash a summon issued by the 1st respondent under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner argued that the summon was issued without any basis and was therefore illegal. The court heard both parties and the learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) submitted that the prayer sought for has become infructuous. This means that the relief sought by the petitioner was no longer relevant or necessary.

The court then dismissed the petition as infructuous. An infructuous petition is one that has become irrelevant or unnecessary due to a change in circumstances. In this case, the prayer sought by the petitioner was no longer relevant because the summon had already been issued and served. Therefore, the court had no reason to quash the summon.

The court also closed the connected miscellaneous petition. A miscellaneous petition is a petition that is filed for a specific purpose, such as seeking permission to file additional documents or seeking clarification on a previous order. In this case, the miscellaneous petition was likely filed in connection with the main petition seeking to quash the summon. Since the main petition was dismissed as infructuous, the connected miscellaneous petition was also closed.

Overall, the court case involving Mariyappan's petition to quash a summon under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was dismissed as infructuous. This means that the relief sought by the petitioner was no longer relevant or necessary due to a change in circumstances. The court also closed the connected miscellaneous petition, which was likely filed in connection with the main petition seeking to quash the summon.
