The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Court of II Additional Sessions Judge, Sabalgarh, District Morena, in Criminal Revision No. 03/2018. The petitioner had filed an application under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C. for the custody of a tractor and trolley, which was dismissed on the ground that confiscation proceedings had been initiated. The II Additional Sessions Judge upheld the dismissal, citing provisions contained in Sections 27, 29, 33, 50, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and Section 41 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.

The petitioner argued that the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of M.P. & Ors. Vs. Madhukar Rao should be considered, but the court dismissed the petition, citing the judgment in the case of State of M.P. and Ors. Vs. Smt. Kallo Bai, which held that the provisions of Section 50 of the Act of 1972 are a complete code in themselves and that confiscation is independent of any proceeding of prosecution for forest offence committed.

The case revolves around the confiscation of a tractor and trolley, which were allegedly used for illegal transportation of forest produce. The petitioner had filed an application under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C. for the custody of the said vehicle, which was dismissed by the II Additional Sessions Judge on the ground that confiscation proceedings had been initiated. The petitioner had argued that the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of M.P. & Ors. Vs. Madhukar Rao should be considered, but the court dismissed the petition, citing the judgment in the case of State of M.P. and Ors. Vs. Smt. Kallo Bai.

The Supreme Court had held in the case of State of M.P. & Ors. Vs. Madhukar Rao that the provisions of Section 50 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, do not bar the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to order the release of the seized property on the ground that the property was not used for the commission of the offence. However, the court in the present case held that the judgment in the case of State of M.P. and Ors. Vs. Smt. Kallo Bai was more relevant, as it held that the provisions of Section 50 of the Act of 1972 are a complete code in themselves and that confiscation is independent of any proceeding of prosecution for forest offence committed.

The court also cited provisions contained in Sections 27, 29, 33, 50, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and Section 41 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, to support its decision. These provisions deal with the power of the authorities to seize and confiscate property used for the commission of forest offences, and the procedure to be followed in such cases.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the relevant laws and judgments while seeking relief in court. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to comply with the laws related to forest and wildlife protection to avoid legal complications.
