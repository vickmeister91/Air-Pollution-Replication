The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Madhavan, who was appointed as a sweeper in the Plant Quarantine and Fumigation Station in Cochin. Madhavan's services were terminated under Rule 6 of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949. He sought to quash the termination order and have it declared that he continues in service. 

The court held that the termination was not in accordance with Rule 5 of the Temporary Service Rules as the appointing authority did not have jurisdiction to issue the order. The court quashed the termination order but declined to grant the relief of reinstatement. 

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures while terminating the services of temporary employees. The court observed that the appointing authority did not follow the procedure laid down in Rule 5 of the Temporary Service Rules, which requires the authority to give a notice to the employee before terminating their services. The court held that the termination order was therefore invalid and quashed it. 

However, the court declined to grant the relief of reinstatement to Madhavan. The court observed that the relief of reinstatement is granted only in exceptional cases where the termination is found to be illegal or arbitrary. In this case, the court held that while the termination was not in accordance with the rules, it was not illegal or arbitrary. The court therefore declined to grant the relief of reinstatement to Madhavan. 

The judgment is significant as it emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures while terminating the services of temporary employees. The court has made it clear that the appointing authority must follow the procedure laid down in the rules before terminating the services of a temporary employee. Failure to do so can result in the termination order being quashed by the court. 

The judgment also highlights the limited scope of relief available to temporary employees whose services have been terminated. While the court can quash the termination order if it is found to be invalid, the relief of reinstatement is granted only in exceptional cases where the termination is found to be illegal or arbitrary. 

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's judgment in Madhavan's case serves as a reminder to employers to follow proper procedures while terminating the services of temporary employees. It also highlights the limited scope of relief available to temporary employees whose services have been terminated. The judgment is significant as it reinforces the importance of following the rules and procedures laid down in the law while dealing with employment matters.
