The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against an order passed by the Additional Judge to the court of First Additional Session Judge, West Nimar, Mandleshwar in Criminal Revision No.111/2016. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. during the trial of the case, which was rejected by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class. The applicant had filed a revision against this order, which was dismissed by the Additional Judge. The court found that the applicant's application was vague and the learned trial court had not committed any mistake in rejecting it. Therefore, the petition was dismissed.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to understand the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure that were invoked in this case. Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. This section is often invoked in cases where there is a miscarriage of justice or where the lower courts have not followed the due process of law.

In this case, the applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. during the trial of the case. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or a warrant to compel the production of any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The applicant had sought the production of certain documents from the prosecution, which was rejected by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class.

The applicant had then filed a revision against this order, which was dismissed by the Additional Judge. The applicant had then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court, challenging the orders passed by the lower courts.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the applicant's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was vague and did not specify the documents that were required to be produced by the prosecution. The court also found that the learned trial court had not committed any mistake in rejecting the application. The court observed that the applicant had not made any effort to specify the documents that were required to be produced and had merely made a general request for the production of documents.

The court also observed that the applicant had not made any effort to show how the production of the documents would help in the defence of the case. The court held that the mere fact that the documents were in the possession of the prosecution did not entitle the applicant to their production. The court further held that the applicant had not made out a case for the exercise of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In conclusion, the court order in this case highlights the importance of making specific and detailed requests for the production of documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court has also reiterated that the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear miscarriage of justice or where the lower courts have not followed the due process of law.
