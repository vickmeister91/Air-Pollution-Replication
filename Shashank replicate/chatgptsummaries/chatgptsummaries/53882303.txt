The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Sh. Joginder Singh Trehan against Sh. Harish Bansal and Sh. Sanjay Bansal for a shop in Delhi. The petitioner claimed that the shop was required for his son's business and that the respondents were habitual defaulters in rent payment. The respondents filed an application for leave to defend, claiming that they were joint tenants and regularly paid rent, and that the petitioner had alternative accommodation for his son's business. 

The court examined the ownership and relationship between the parties and the bonafide requirement and non-availability of suitable accommodation. The court referred to previous judgments and concluded that the petitioner's need should be genuine and not a mere whim or fancy. The court reserved the order on 13 August 2012 and passed it on 21 August 2012.

The court order states that a landlord's requirement for eviction must be a genuine need and not a mere whim or fancy. The landlord is the best judge of their requirement, and the tenant cannot dictate the terms on which the landlord should live. In this case, the petitioner's son needed the premises to extend his business, and the court found that the respondents failed to raise any triable issues or disclose material facts that would disentitle the landlord from getting eviction orders. 

The court passed an eviction order in favor of the petitioner and against the respondents, directing them to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the tenanted shop. The petitioner cannot obtain possession of the premises before the expiry of six months from the date of passing of this order.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of genuine need for eviction and the landlord's right to determine their own requirements. The court examined the ownership and relationship between the parties and the bonafide requirement and non-availability of suitable accommodation before passing the eviction order. The court also referred to previous judgments and concluded that the petitioner's need should be genuine and not a mere whim or fancy.

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of tenants paying rent on time and not defaulting on payments. The respondents in this case were habitual defaulters in rent payment, which was a factor considered by the court in passing the eviction order.

The court's decision in this case is in line with previous judgments that have emphasized the importance of genuine need for eviction and the landlord's right to determine their own requirements. The court's decision also highlights the importance of tenants paying rent on time and not defaulting on payments.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to both landlords and tenants of their respective rights and responsibilities. Landlords have the right to determine their own requirements for eviction, but this must be based on genuine need and not a mere whim or fancy. Tenants, on the other hand, have the responsibility to pay rent on time and not default on payments.
