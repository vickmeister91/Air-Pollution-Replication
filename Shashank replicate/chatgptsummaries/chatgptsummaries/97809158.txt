The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Sunil Kumar Gupta in connection with a case filed against him for the alleged theft of four tractors with sand. The petitioner claimed to be the owner of the tractors and provided documents to support his claim. The court ordered his release on bail upon arrest or surrender, subject to certain conditions.

The case against Gupta was filed under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with theft. The prosecution alleged that Gupta had stolen four tractors loaded with sand from a construction site. The police had registered a case against him and were investigating the matter.

Gupta, on the other hand, claimed that he was the owner of the tractors and had all the necessary documents to prove it. He argued that he had taken the tractors to the construction site for work and had left them there overnight. However, when he returned the next day, he found that the tractors were missing.

Gupta then approached the Patna High Court seeking anticipatory bail. His counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the theft. The counsel also submitted documents to support Gupta's claim of ownership of the tractors.

After hearing both sides, the court granted anticipatory bail to Gupta. The court observed that the documents submitted by Gupta appeared to be genuine and that there was no evidence to suggest that he had stolen the tractors. The court also noted that Gupta had cooperated with the police during the investigation and had not tried to evade arrest.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions on Gupta's bail. He was directed to cooperate with the police during the investigation and to appear before the investigating officer as and when required. He was also directed not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court granted anticipatory bail to Sunil Kumar Gupta in connection with a case filed against him for the alleged theft of four tractors with sand. The court observed that the documents submitted by Gupta appeared to be genuine and that there was no evidence to suggest that he had stolen the tractors. The court also imposed certain conditions on Gupta's bail to ensure that he cooperates with the police during the investigation and does not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.
