The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving construction in Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas in Kerala, India. The first order pertains to a writ appeal against a judgment in a previous case. The appellant is DLF Universal Limited, formerly known as Adelie Builders & Developers Pvt Ltd. The respondents include Antony A.V., Corporation of Cochin, Assistant Executive Engineer, East Zonal Officer, Corporation of Cochin, the Secretary of Kerala State Coastal Management Authority, the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and the District Collector of Ernakulam. The court heard the case on August 26, 2016, and delivered its judgment on December 21, 2016. The order includes a list of annexures submitted by the petitioner.

The second order discusses a case involving the construction of a multi-storeyed residential complex in violation of Coastal Zone Regulations. The court is considering whether the concession given under the regulations for construction/re-construction of a building in a property can be extended to other properties along the coastal side of the state or should be restricted to the next/adjoining plot. The court is also examining whether the construction of the building, completed before obtaining CRZ clearance, can be regularized if there is a violation of relevant provisions of law. The court has ordered the demolition of the building and rejected the authenticity of an integrated environment clearance obtained by the builder. The court has also dismissed a challenge to a report prepared by a committee appointed by the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority.

The third order discusses a case involving the construction of a residential complex by a builder in Kochi. The prospective purchasers of the flats filed a petition seeking occupancy certificates and permanent building numbers. The case involved violations of Coastal Zone Regulation Notification and Environment Impact Assessment Notification. The court heard arguments from various parties, including the builder, the local authority, and the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority. The court also noted that the Central Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests had deferred the proposal for the project due to violations. The court did not provide a final decision in the order.

The fourth order discusses a project that was deferred due to concerns about the validity of an imaginary line concept and the need for the Member Secretary of Kerala CZMA to attend meetings. The project was later granted environmental clearance by SEIAA, but this clearance was deemed null and void by the court. The court also ruled that the construction of a residential project in a CRZ II area is a permissible activity subject to regulation. The court rejected the argument that the word "existing" in the CRZ Notification referred only to structures in existence before 1991. The court ordered the demolition of the unauthorized construction.

The fifth order discusses the construction of a building in a CRZ area and whether it is authorized or not. The court finds that the construction is unauthorized and liable to be demolished. The court also discusses a clarification letter issued by the MoEF regarding the benefit of landward construction with reference to an existing authorized building. The court finds that the existence of a natural canal on the northern boundary of the property does not place any hurdle in assessing the right of the beneficiary to effect construction with reference to the authorized building. The court also discusses the scope and intent of the CRZ notification and the exception carved out to favor adversely affected parties to a limited extent. The court concludes that the benefit of the provision to effect construction with reference to the existing road or existing authorized building is available only to certain property owners and not others.

The sixth order pertains to a case involving the construction of a large apartment project in Kerala, India. The court ruled that the project did not have the necessary environmental clearance and ordered the demolition of the entire structure. The order also clarified that only properties bordering a road between the property and a water body are entitled to construction benefits, and that the benefit cannot be extended to nearby properties. The court also rejected the argument that the SEIAA (State Environment Impact Assessment Authority) needed to be impleaded in the party array, and that the National Green Tribunal cannot oust the jurisdiction of the High Court in environmental matters.

The seventh order states that the construction of a project costing over 100 crores was completed without obtaining necessary clearances under the CRZ Notification and EIA Notification. The court ordered the demolition of the entire structure, but the appellant argued that only a portion of the building was situated in the objectionable area and that demolition would cause more damage to the environmental/ecological balance. The court considered the salient aspects and sequence of events and decided that the demolition could be avoided if the property was not in a CRZ I area and only a portion of the property was coming under CRZ II area. The court also noted that several other multi-storeyed buildings had come up in the area on both sides of the Chilavannur river, and yet sustained without being demolished.

The eighth order states that the building in question will not be demolished, but the builder will have to pay a fine of Rs. 1 crore for the damage caused to the environment due to the construction without proper clearance. The fine will be deposited with the District Collector and used exclusively for building up the environment and maintaining ecological balance in the area. The court also discusses the validity of the clearance obtained by the builder and the constitution of a committee to investigate the matter.

The ninth order states that the Chief Secretary had no
