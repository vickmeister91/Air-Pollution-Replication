The Jammu & Kashmir High Court recently quashed an order to close a guest house owned by Pritam Singh. The court cited that the order was issued without notice and without affording Singh an opportunity to be heard. The court has given the respondents the liberty to issue notice to Singh and afford him an opportunity of hearing before passing a speaking order in accordance with the law.

The case involved a guest house owned by Pritam Singh, which was ordered to be closed by the authorities. The order was issued without any prior notice to Singh and without giving him an opportunity to be heard. Singh challenged the order in the Jammu & Kashmir High Court, arguing that the order was illegal and arbitrary.

The court agreed with Singh's arguments and quashed the order. The court held that the order was issued in violation of the principles of natural justice, which require that a person be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against them. The court also noted that the order was passed without any reasons being given, which made it even more arbitrary.

The court further held that the respondents were at liberty to issue notice to Singh and afford him an opportunity of hearing before passing a speaking order in accordance with the law. This means that the authorities can still take action against Singh if they have valid reasons to do so, but they must follow the proper procedures and give Singh a fair opportunity to defend himself.

This decision by the Jammu & Kashmir High Court is an important reminder of the importance of following the principles of natural justice in all legal proceedings. It also highlights the need for authorities to give reasons for their decisions, so that they can be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the Jammu & Kashmir High Court has quashed an order to close a guest house owned by Pritam Singh, citing that the order was issued without notice and without affording Singh an opportunity to be heard. The court has given the respondents the liberty to issue notice to Singh and afford him an opportunity of hearing before passing a speaking order in accordance with the law. This decision reinforces the importance of following the principles of natural justice and giving reasons for decisions in all legal proceedings.
