The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal recently heard an appeal by the CCE, Delhi III against M/S Maruti Suzuki India Limited regarding the availability of Cenvat credit on housekeeping services and business auxiliary services. The Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) had allowed the credit, but the revenue contested it. The Tribunal found that the credit was allowable for housekeeping services as they were necessary for pollution control and maintaining a healthy environment for employees. However, the credit was not allowable for business auxiliary services as they had no nexus with the manufacturing/clearance process of final products. The appeal was partially allowed and the Commissioner's order was partially modified.

The case centered around the availability of Cenvat credit on housekeeping services and business auxiliary services. The Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) had allowed the credit, but the revenue contested it. The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal heard the appeal and ultimately found that the credit was allowable for housekeeping services, but not for business auxiliary services.

The Tribunal's decision was based on the fact that housekeeping services were necessary for pollution control and maintaining a healthy environment for employees. As such, they were directly related to the manufacturing/clearance process of final products and were eligible for Cenvat credit. On the other hand, business auxiliary services had no nexus with the manufacturing/clearance process of final products and were therefore not eligible for Cenvat credit.

The Tribunal's decision partially allowed the appeal and partially modified the Commissioner's order. This means that Maruti Suzuki India Limited will be able to claim Cenvat credit on housekeeping services, but not on business auxiliary services.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of understanding the eligibility criteria for Cenvat credit. While some services may seem related to the manufacturing/clearance process of final products, they may not be eligible for credit if they do not have a direct nexus. It is important for businesses to carefully review their expenses and consult with experts to ensure that they are claiming all eligible credits and avoiding any potential disputes with revenue authorities.
