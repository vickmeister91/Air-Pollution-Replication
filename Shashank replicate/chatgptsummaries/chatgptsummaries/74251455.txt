The court order in question relates to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that was filed against an industrial unit in Madhubani, Bihar, for violating pollution control laws and posing a threat to the environment. The court notes that the jurisdiction to deal with environmental matters now lies with the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but as it has not been constituted in Bihar, the court has exercised its writ jurisdiction.

The court acknowledges that the NGT has been established to deal with environmental matters and has been given wide-ranging powers to enforce environmental laws and regulations. However, as the NGT has not yet been constituted in Bihar, the court has taken it upon itself to hear the matter.

The court notes that the industrial unit in question has been found to be in violation of pollution control laws and has been causing harm to the environment. The court orders the unit to immediately cease all operations and to take steps to rectify the damage that has been caused.

The court also notes that the matter has already been dealt with by the NGT in Kolkata. As such, the court sees no reason to make any further indulgence into the matter and advises the petitioner to approach the NGT in Kolkata.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. It also underscores the role of the NGT in ensuring that environmental issues are dealt with in a timely and effective manner.

The court's decision also serves as a reminder to industrial units and other entities that they must comply with environmental laws and regulations and take steps to minimize their impact on the environment. Failure to do so can result in legal action and significant penalties.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental issues are given the attention they deserve and that those responsible for causing harm to the environment are held accountable for their actions. It also highlights the importance of establishing and empowering institutions such as the NGT to deal with environmental matters in a timely and effective manner.
