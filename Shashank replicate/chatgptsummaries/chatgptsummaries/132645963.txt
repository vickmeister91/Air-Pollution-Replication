The court order pertains to an application for anticipatory bail in connection with a case under the Wildlife Protection Act and Arms Act. The petitioners have claimed that they are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the crime. The prosecution, on the other hand, has alleged that the petitioners were involved in hunting deer and were caught with two other co-accused.

After hearing both sides, the court has allowed the application for anticipatory bail and directed that the petitioners shall be released on bail upon their furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an important legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Arms Act, 1959, on the other hand, regulates the possession, manufacture, sale, and use of arms and ammunition.

In this case, the petitioners have been accused of violating both these Acts. The prosecution has alleged that the petitioners were involved in hunting deer, which is a prohibited activity under the Wildlife Protection Act. They have also been accused of possessing arms without a valid license, which is an offense under the Arms Act.

The petitioners, however, have denied these allegations and have claimed that they have been falsely implicated in the case. They have argued that they were not present at the scene of the crime and have been wrongly accused by the prosecution.

After hearing both sides, the court has allowed the application for anticipatory bail filed by the petitioners. Anticipatory bail is a provision under the Criminal Procedure Code that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of his or her arrest. The court has directed that the petitioners shall be released on bail upon their furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer.

The court has also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners. They have been directed to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the investigating officer as and when required. They have also been directed not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by the petitioners in connection with a case under the Wildlife Protection Act and Arms Act. The court has allowed the application and directed that the petitioners shall be released on bail upon their furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer. The court has also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners to ensure that they cooperate with the investigation and do not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.
