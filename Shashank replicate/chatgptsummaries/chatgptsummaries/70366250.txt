The Punjab Pollution Control Board has been at the center of a legal battle involving four criminal petitions filed against it by various individuals who were accused of violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The accused were public servants at the time of the alleged violations, and the complainant did not obtain any sanction from the competent authority to prosecute them under Section 197 Cr.PC. 

The case was brought before the court, which ruled that the accused cannot be prosecuted without sanction and quashed the complaints and summoning orders. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused were public servants at the time of the alleged violations, and therefore, the complainant needed to obtain the requisite sanction from the competent authority to prosecute them under Section 197 Cr.PC.

The court's decision was a significant victory for the accused, who had been facing criminal charges without any legal basis. The court's ruling effectively put an end to the legal battle, and the accused were free to go about their business without any further legal repercussions.

However, the complainant was not entirely defeated. The court gave them permission to file fresh complaints after obtaining the requisite sanction. This meant that the complainant could still pursue legal action against the accused, but only after obtaining the necessary sanction from the competent authority.

The court's decision was a clear indication that the law must be followed, and that public servants cannot be prosecuted without the requisite sanction. The court's ruling was a significant victory for the accused, who had been facing criminal charges without any legal basis.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary sanction before prosecuting public servants. It also underscores the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights and to seek legal advice when faced with legal challenges.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the Punjab Pollution Control Board case was a significant victory for the accused, who had been facing criminal charges without any legal basis. The court's ruling effectively put an end to the legal battle, and the accused were free to go about their business without any further legal repercussions. However, the complainant was given permission to file fresh complaints after obtaining the requisite sanction, highlighting the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary sanction before prosecuting public servants.
