The court order in question pertains to a criminal case filed by the President of a Rotary club against its Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. During the enquiry stage, the Magistrate issued a notice to the accused to produce certain documents related to the club. However, the accused resisted this notice on the grounds that they cannot be compelled to do so under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. The Magistrate rejected this contention, relying on a previous court decision. However, the court order states that the previous decision was incorrect and that no order under Section 91 of the Code can be issued against an accused person. Therefore, the court quashes the impugned order.

The case in question involves a dispute between the President of a Rotary club and its Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. During the enquiry stage of the case, the Magistrate issued a notice to the accused to produce certain documents related to the club. However, the accused resisted this notice on the grounds that they cannot be compelled to do so under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. This article provides protection against self-incrimination, stating that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.

The Magistrate rejected the accused's contention, relying on a previous court decision. However, the court order states that the previous decision was incorrect and that no order under Section 91 of the Code can be issued against an accused person. Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a court to issue an order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The court order notes that the previous decision relied on by the Magistrate was based on a misinterpretation of Section 91 of the Code. The previous decision had held that an order under Section 91 could be issued against an accused person, provided that the order was not for the purpose of self-incrimination. However, the court order notes that this interpretation is incorrect, as Section 91 does not provide for any exception to the protection against self-incrimination provided by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.

Therefore, the court order quashes the impugned order and holds that no order under Section 91 of the Code can be issued against an accused person. This decision provides important clarification on the scope of Section 91 and the protection against self-incrimination provided by Article 20(3) of the Constitution. It also highlights the importance of careful interpretation of legal provisions and the need to avoid misinterpretation that can lead to incorrect decisions.
