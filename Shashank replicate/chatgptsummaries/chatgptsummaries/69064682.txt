The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two cases, CWPIL No. 27 of 2017 and CWPIL No. 13 of 2015. The applicants in the case had requested to be impleaded as party respondents and for necessary directions to be issued to restore electricity and water connection to their hotels, stay homes, and restaurants, which had been closed down by the authorities for operating without permission. 

The court did not grant any interim relief but allowed the applicants to approach relevant authorities within two days to consider and decide their cases. The authorities were directed to restore electricity and water connection if the applicants fulfilled the criteria for setting up and running hotels. The court disposed of all the applications.

In the second case, CWPIL No. 13 of 2015, the court ordered for a fresh status report to be filed before the next hearing, which is scheduled for September 27th, 2018. Mr. Vivek Sharma represented the Amicus Curiae, and Mr. Ajay Vaidya represented the State.

The court's decision in the first case is significant as it provides a pathway for the applicants to have their businesses reinstated if they meet the necessary criteria. It also highlights the importance of obtaining the proper permissions and licenses before operating a business in the state.

The court's decision in the second case indicates that the court is actively monitoring the situation and expects progress to be made before the next hearing. The filing of a fresh status report suggests that the court is interested in seeing concrete steps being taken to address the issues at hand.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the court's commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that businesses operate within the legal framework. It also highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary permissions and licenses before starting a business. The court's decision to allow the applicants to approach relevant authorities within two days to consider and decide their cases is a positive step towards resolving the issue and providing relief to the affected businesses.
