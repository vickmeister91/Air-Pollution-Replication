The Kerala High Court recently heard a case involving a dispute over the term of office for a member of the Syndicate at Cochin University of Science and Technology. The State Government argued that the member's term should only be for the remaining portion of the previous incumbent's tenure, while the private respondent argued that they were entitled to a full four-year term. The court examined relevant sections of the University Act and ultimately ruled in favor of the private respondent, allowing them to continue as a member of the Syndicate for the full four-year term.

In another case, the court discussed the filling of vacancies in the Syndicate, a body of the University. Section 45 of the Act allows for vacancies to be filled by appointment or nomination by the State Government, and such appointees hold office only for the remaining period of the member they replace. The appointment of a member under Section 17(1)(viii) of the Act is for a period of four years, but if a vacancy arises, the State Government can nominate a replacement for the remaining period of the member they replace. The court cited a previous case to support the idea that the Syndicate is a continuous body and that nominations or appointments under Section 17(1) are controlled by sub-section (2) of Section 17. The court also cited a case involving the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, to support the idea that a person appointed to fill a casual vacancy holds office only for the remainder of the term of the person they replace.

The court also discussed the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Cochin University of Science and Technology Act, 1986. It explained that in case of a casual vacancy of a member of a board, the successor nominee who fills up the vacancy will have only the unexpired period of office available to the original incumbent. The court clarified that a nomination made to fill up a casual vacancy can only be for the remaining period in whose place the nominee is nominated. The court ultimately set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge and directed the parties to bear their own costs.

In the first case, the State Government appealed a decision allowing a private respondent to continue serving as a member of the Syndicate of the Cochin University of Science and Technology. The State Government had informed the respondent that his term had expired, but he believed he could continue to serve. The court examined the notification of his nomination and the State Government's order informing him of the expiration of his term. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of the State Government, finding that the respondent's term had indeed expired.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of understanding the relevant sections of the University Act and other applicable laws when it comes to filling vacancies and determining the term of office for members of university bodies. It is crucial to follow the correct procedures and ensure that appointments and nominations are made in accordance with the law to avoid disputes and legal challenges.
