The court orders summarized here cover a range of civil cases involving breaches of court orders, jurisdictional issues, and specific performance of property agreements. In one case, Velbai filed a civil application against Natha Harji Halai and 13 others for breaching an interim order in a Special Civil Suit involving the quashing of two registered sale deeds for a property in Bhuj. The court heard arguments from both sides before making a decision, but the summary does not provide information on the court's decision.

In another case, the court heard arguments from both sides in a case involving a breach of an order of status quo. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendants were guilty and should be punished, while the defendants' lawyer argued that the plaintiff had no case on merits and that the breach was not willful. The court considered the facts and circumstances of the case and referred to relevant case law before proceeding to consider the case of the parties.

In a third case, the court granted respondents 10 to 12 time to file an affidavit-in-reply and directed all parties to maintain status quo with regard to the disputed land until June 18, 2015. The order also referenced several case laws relied on by the parties, including one where a defendant was imprisoned and fined for violating an order of the court.

In another case, the court found that the contemner violated the court's orders by entering into agreements, accepting cheques, and receiving consideration during the proceedings. The court held that such actions amounted to the creation of interest prohibited by the court's order. The court also distinguished the situation from a previous case where the disobedience of an injunction order was erased after the order was set aside, stating that disobedience does not get erased under Rule 2-A of Order 39.

In yet another case, the court discussed a case where the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was questioned by the defendants. The court ultimately found that the Civil Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit, but the defendants had violated interim orders made by the Civil Court during the six-year period before the High Court's decision on jurisdiction. The court held that the defendants could not escape punishment for violating the interim orders by claiming that they were non est due to the lack of jurisdiction.

The court also emphasized that the objection to jurisdiction does not render the court incompetent to grant interim relief and that the objection should be decided at the earliest possible moment. In another case, the court stated that disobeying an interim injunction, even if it was filed in the wrong court unknowingly, is a violation of the rule of law and the authority of the courts. The court can proceed against anyone who has committed a breach of the order, even if they are not a party to the proceedings.

Filing a false affidavit is considered criminal contempt, and selling property despite an injunction can lead to imprisonment and fines. The defendant argued that the company has its own distinct personality from an individual, but this argument was not helpful in this case. The court cited various cases to support its decision.

In a case where the plaintiff was seeking specific performance of an agreement for the sale of property, the defendant had disputed the payment of part sale consideration, and no evidence was produced by the plaintiff to show the source of payment. Third parties had purchased the property by registered sale deed after giving public notice and paying the full sale consideration. The court held that there was no prima facie case in favor of the plaintiff and the balance of convenience was in favor of the bona fide purchasers.

The court also discussed various facets of relevant considerations when breach of order is alleged and the defense available. The defendant in the present case had filed an affidavit-in-reply stating that the applicant had moved the civil application after a period of 3 years and 4 months, and the matter was listed for hearing on 06.04.2015. The court had ordered the matter.

In another case, opponents 10 to 12 requested time to file an affidavit in reply, and the court ordered the matter to stand over to 18.06.2015 while directing the parties to maintain status quo with regard to the disputed land. The defendants allegedly executed several sale deeds on 07.04.2015 and 08.04.2015, and defendant no.10 claims they were not aware of the court order at the time. The order also mentions that the trial court dismissed the suit on 09.04.2015.

In a case where the defendant claimed they were not aware of the court order and therefore executed sale deeds, the court found this claim difficult to believe and concluded that the defendant committed a breach of the order. The court considered various aspects such as the absence of an interim order in favor of the applicant, the fact that only one defendant executed the sale deeds, and the size of the property.

The court also considered mitigating circumstances such as the substantial consideration received earlier and the fact that the plaintiff is unlikely to get any final relief. Ultimately, the court decided on the punishment for the breach of the interim order.

In another case, the court granted permission to the applicant to place an additional affidavit on record in support of Civil Application No. 6510 of 2015. The affidavit alleged that the opponent had committed a breach of the order dated 06.04.2015 in various ways. The court decided to hear Civil Application No. 1768 of 2016 along with Civil Application No
