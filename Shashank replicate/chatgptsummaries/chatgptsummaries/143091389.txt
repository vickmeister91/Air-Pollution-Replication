The Supreme Court of India recently issued three court orders pertaining to wildlife protection and import regulations. The first order dealt with the import of a stuffed leopard trophy into India, which is a protected and prohibited species under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The CITES had refused to grant permission for the import, but the High Court had allowed it. The Supreme Court found that the permissions granted by the DGFT and Chief Wildlife Warden were conditional and subject to CITES approval, which was not given. The court also emphasized the importance of protecting endangered species and their habitats.

The second court order discussed the protection of the leopard species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The leopard was listed in Appendix I in 1975, which prohibited international trade in the animal or its products for commercial purposes. However, killing of specimens may be sanctioned by countries of export in defense of life and property and to enhance the survival of the species. The court emphasized the importance of the Scientific and Management Authorities in regulating the import of leopard specimens and ensuring their survival. The court set aside previous orders and allowed the respondent to apply to the Scientific Authority for necessary permission to keep a leopard trophy, subject to any legal challenges.

The third court order heard a civil appeal between Regional Deputy Director and Zavaray S. Poonawala & Ors. The appellant was represented by several lawyers and the respondents were represented by four lawyers. The court disposed of the appeal in accordance with the signed order.

The first court order highlights the importance of protecting endangered species and their habitats. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) are two important regulations that aim to protect wildlife from illegal trade and exploitation. The court found that the permissions granted by the DGFT and Chief Wildlife Warden were conditional and subject to CITES approval, which was not given. This decision reinforces the importance of following regulations and obtaining necessary approvals before importing or exporting protected species.

The second court order discusses the protection of the leopard species under CITES. The court emphasized the importance of the Scientific and Management Authorities in regulating the import of leopard specimens and ensuring their survival. The court also allowed the respondent to apply to the Scientific Authority for necessary permission to keep a leopard trophy, subject to any legal challenges. This decision highlights the importance of balancing conservation efforts with the interests of individuals who may have legally obtained specimens.

The third court order disposed of a civil appeal between Regional Deputy Director and Zavaray S. Poonawala & Ors. The details of the appeal are not provided, but it is clear that the court made a decision in accordance with the signed order.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of protecting endangered species and regulating the trade of wildlife. The courts have emphasized the need to follow regulations and obtain necessary approvals before importing or exporting protected species. At the same time, the courts have also recognized the interests of individuals who may have legally obtained specimens. These decisions highlight the delicate balance between conservation efforts and individual interests, and the importance of finding solutions that benefit both.
