The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case between PMP Infratech Pvt. Limited and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. The petitioner challenged the Bid Evaluation Criteria and requested to amend it as suggested during the pre-bid meeting. The court heard the case and issued an oral order. The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, having designated as "AA" class Civil Contractor, claiming the experience in the field of disposal of hazardous waste - sludge. The respondent Corporation (ONGC) published Notice Inviting Tender (NIT for short) being No. E16XC20006 dated 4.2.2020 for hiring of services of Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (for short 'TSDF'), for disposal and incineration of sludge which is hazardous waste generated in various effluent treatment plants of Mehsana Asset of respondents for a period of 3 years with certain eligibility criteria.

The court order pertains to a tender for the collection, transportation, and disposal of sludge waste from the E&P industry/drilling waste. The tender includes financial criteria and requires bidders to have successfully executed similar work in the past seven years. The petitioner company has challenged the eligibility criteria, alleging that they are tailored to favor a particular company and exclude them from participating in the bid. The respondent corporation has denied the allegations and stated that the eligibility criteria are based on statutory requirements and necessary for the scope of work. The court has heard arguments from both sides and is yet to make a decision.

The petitioner company argued that their fundamental right to carry out business has been infringed due to the eligibility criteria set by the respondent Corporation. The petitioner claimed that the eligibility criteria were not in compliance with relevant guidelines issued by the Central Vigilance Commission and were arbitrary, discriminatory, illegal, and not adhering to the CVC guidelines. The respondent Corporation argued that the court should not interfere with the Bid Evolution Criteria unless it is arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory. The eligibility criteria were incorporated on account of statutory provision, and in the absence of any proof of malafide, arbitrariness, or unreasonableness, the eligibility criteria cannot be examined or amended under the power of judicial review. The respondent Corporation also argued that the subject NIT for treatment and disposal of hazardous and other waste is a highly complex contract that demands specialized skill as provided under the Rules 2016.

The court order states that no new submissions have been made by either party and that the court has considered all oral and written submissions and reviewed the records carefully. The scope of judicial review in awarding contracts has been defined by the Supreme Court, which allows the High Court to interfere in contractual matters if the tendering authority's actions are found to be malicious, discriminatory, or arbitrary. The petitioner company in this case challenges the Bid Eligibility Criteria B.1.2.0 of the NIC, claiming that it was drafted to exclude them and favor another group, making it arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory. The court refers to previous Supreme Court cases to determine the right balance between administrative discretion and the need to remedy any unfairness, stating that the court should not interfere with commercial transactions unless there is substantial public interest involved or the transaction is mala fide. The court also emphasizes the importance of reasonableness and fairness in state actions and the need for a discernible principle to emerge from any impugned action.

The court order pertains to a case where various State Governments were accused of tailoring tender conditions to favor companies with foreign collaboration, thereby excluding indigenous manufacturers from the tender process. The appellant argued that this violated Article 14 of the Constitution and created a monopoly in favor of selected bidders. The court held that unless the tendering authority's actions were found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory powers, tender conditions were unassailable. The court also held that the terms of the notices inviting tenders did not deliberately exclude domestic manufacturers and new entrepreneurs in the field. The court dismissed all the writ petitions filed in this case. The court also stated that judicial review in contractual matters or matters in which the Government exercises its contractual powers is intended to prevent arbitrariness and must be exercised in larger public interest. The court further stated that evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are essentially commercial functions, and principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance.

The court order states that tenderers or contractors with grievances can seek damages in a civil court. The court should resist attempts by unsuccessful tenderers to make mountains out of molehills of technical/procedural violations or self-prejudice. The court should only interfere in tender or contractual matters if the process or decision is mala fide, arbitrary, or irrational, and if public interest is affected. The court should pose questions to itself before interfering in tender or contractual matters. The court examined the facts and evidence presented by both parties and found no evidence of arbitrary or discriminatory clauses in the eligibility criteria. The court also found that the terms and conditions were not drafted with malafide intention to favor certain companies. The court stated that the eligibility criteria must be followed by all companies after the rules came into force in 2016.

The court order discusses the requirement for obtaining authorization for managing hazardous and other wastes under the Rules 2016. The respondent corporation is required to obtain "consent to establish" under the rules, and the successful bidder must have a Gujarat Pollution Control Board
