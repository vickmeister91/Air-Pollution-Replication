The High Court of Madras has issued several court orders related to the implementation of a "Special Financial Assistance" program in Tamil Nadu, India, which provides one-time financial aid of Rs. 2,000 to poor families living in rural and urban areas, particularly agricultural and other laborers. The program was initiated in response to the effects of the Gaja cyclone and drought in the region. The government has identified eligible families through a Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) program and will exclude duplications by integrating available databases. The government has constituted a Monitoring Committee to oversee the program's implementation.

One of the court orders pertains to an announcement made by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in the Legislative Assembly on 11.02.2019, regarding a scheme to provide one-time financial assistance of Rs. 2000 to poor families living in rural and urban areas of the state. The Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Corporation for Women Development Limited has requested the government to allocate Rs. 1200 crores for the implementation of the scheme. The scheme will be implemented by the Corporation for Women Development Limited, with the Commissioner of Municipal Administration and Director of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj as coordinators for urban and rural areas respectively. The government has examined the proposal and ordered the implementation of the scheme for identified poor families.

Another court order discusses the identification of poor families in rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu through various surveys and criteria. The government has identified 32.13 lakh families as very poor and poor in rural areas and 23.54 lakh households in urban areas. The government plans to provide special financial assistance of Rs. 2,000 to these families for their livelihood security. The assistance will also be provided to laborers registered through various welfare boards. Additional information like Aadhaar number, smart card number, bank accounts, and mobile numbers are being collected to avoid duplication and validate the list. The justification for the financial assistance is the damage caused by the Gaja cyclone in 12 districts of Tamil Nadu.

The Satta Panchayat Iyakkam filed a writ petition in the High Court of Madras, requesting a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to identify the truly deserved beneficiaries, including those affected by Gaja Cyclone, from the already acknowledged data of Below Poverty Line families with well-defined parameters and to publish the same on the website for public scrutiny. The petitioner also requested the record/reasons because of which the inflated number of 60 lakh families were arrived at in the announcement made in Tamil Nadu Assembly on 11.02.2019 by the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The petitioner contended that the estimate of 60 lakh families said to be under below poverty line and provided with the "Special Financial Assistance" is highly inflated and that the decision is arbitrary. The Advocate General submitted that the government is taking necessary steps to identify the beneficiaries.

The court order discusses the implementation of the "Special Financial Assistance" program and rejected a party's contention that the program was politically motivated. The court noted that the government had followed a thorough procedure to identify eligible families. The court order also includes the text of the government's G.O.(Ms.) No.19, which outlines the program's details. Poor families, including agricultural laborers and laborers engaged in various trades, who have already been surveyed and identified as poor families, will be benefited under the scheme. A monitoring committee is constituted for the effective implementation of the scheme. A sum of Rs. 1200 crore will be allocated in supplement estimates of 2018-19 for urban and rural areas. The amount will not be paid in cash but will be deposited under a specific head of account. The Commissioner of Municipal Administration and the Director of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj are authorized to draw and disburse the amount. Detailed guidelines for the implementation of the scheme will be issued separately.

The court order also contains details of the identification of poor families in Tamil Nadu for various welfare programs. The Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) process was conducted in 31 rural districts and 120 blocks under the World Bank-assisted Tamil Nadu Pudhu Vaazhvu Project and subsequently in 265 blocks under the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission to identify rural poor households. The PIP process involved various techniques to ensure that no poor family is left out in the village. Very poor and poor families were identified based on specific criteria. The order is copied to various government officials.

The court order emphasizes the importance of genuine public interest in public interest litigation and warns against abusing the process of the court to persist with a personal point of view. The court also highlights the need for a clean heart, mind, and objective in approaching the court for relief in public interest. The court cites previous cases and definitions of public interest to support its stance. The court warns against the abuse of PIL by individuals with personal gain or political motives, and stresses the need for genuine litigants with legitimate grievances to have their cases heard. The court also cautions against the use of PIL for publicity or personal vendettas, and emphasizes the need for PIL to be used as an effective weapon for delivering social justice to citizens.

The court order discusses the limitations of public interest litigation and the need for such cases to be filed only for the vindication or enforcement of fundamental rights of a group of persons or community who are unable to enforce their rights
