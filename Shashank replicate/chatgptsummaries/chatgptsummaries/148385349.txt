The court order pertains to a group of companies and individuals who have filed writ petitions to quash a First Information Report (FIR) filed against them by Hira Steels Ltd. The FIR alleges that the petitioners committed offenses related to the sale of iron ore fines. The petitioners argue that the FIR is an abuse of process and that the investigation is illegal and without jurisdiction. The court heard the case and decided that the petitions are to be heard together since common issues arise. The court did not make a final decision on the case in this order.

The court order lists the petitioners and respondents in two writ petitions filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The first petition seeks to quash FIR179/2012 filed by Respondent No.4 against the petitioners in Civil Lines, Police Station, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, and return all the books, documents, and other materials belonging to the petitioners seized. The second petition lists four companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956, and their directors as petitioners.

The court order discusses a dispute between the petitioners and respondent no. 4 regarding the quality of iron ore supplied by the petitioners to respondent no. 4. The petitioners allege that the freezing of their bank accounts by the Raipur Police is illegal and without jurisdiction. The respondent argues that the police have the authority to investigate any offense and that the freezing of the accounts is necessary to prevent the illegal gains obtained by the petitioners. The court also notes that there are multiple FIRs filed against the petitioners and that the petitioners' claims of an unholy nexus between the police and respondent no. 4 are baseless. The court rejects the petitioners' claims and upholds the actions of the police and respondent no. 4.

The court order pertains to two petitions challenging the freezing of bank accounts by the Raipur Police in connection with an alleged fraud in a commercial transaction between two companies. The petitioners argue that the freezing of their accounts is illegal and without jurisdiction. The court limits its inquiry to certain aspects and cites a Supreme Court ruling that investigation of an offense is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the police department, and the adjudicatory function of the judiciary commences only after the police submit a report to the court. The court will determine whether the freezing of the bank accounts was legal or not.

The court order discusses the functions of the judiciary and the police in investigating crimes. The court states that the police have the statutory right to investigate without requiring authority from the judiciary, and it would be unfortunate to interfere with those rights. The court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it. The court also cautions against quashing charge-sheets before cognizance is taken by a criminal court, as it amounts to "killing a stillborn child." The court dismisses two petitions challenging the freezing of bank accounts by the Raipur Police, stating that a partial cause of action arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the court cannot be considered determinative and that it is more appropriate for the petitioners to invoke the jurisdiction of another High Court.

In summary, the court order deals with multiple writ petitions filed by various companies and individuals challenging the legality and jurisdiction of the Raipur Police in freezing their bank accounts and filing FIRs against them. The court heard the arguments of both parties and reserved its decision on the matter. The court also discussed the functions of the judiciary and the police in investigating crimes and cautioned against interfering with the statutory rights of the police. The court dismissed some of the petitions, stating that they should be filed in another High Court.
