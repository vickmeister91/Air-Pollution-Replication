The Rajasthan High Court recently heard multiple petitions from owners of stone crushers who were challenging two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke consent to operate, leading to the closure of the units. The petitioners argued that they had no other option but to approach the court under its writ jurisdiction as the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time.

The court heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions and noted that the Board had the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration. The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the powers of the State Board to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution.

The court rejects the argument that the petitioners should have appealed the Board's directions under Section 31A of the Act, as the Act distinguishes between orders and directions, and Section 31 only grants the right to appeal against orders. The court also finds that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court, as their fundamental rights and principles of natural justice were violated.

The court considers the arguments of both parties regarding the Board's orders under Section 21 and Section 31A of the Act, and ultimately finds that the Board was not justified in refusing to renew the consent order without following the proper procedure and that the notices issued by the Board were vague and equivocal. The court also rejects the argument that the present case is covered by a previous case where the court upheld a similar order, as the facts and circumstances of the two cases are different.

In another case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the court found that the Board did not follow proper procedure when renewing the consent order for the stone crusher, and that the notice given to the company was vague and unclear. The court also noted that the Board had not followed proper procedures when passing the impugned orders. The court ultimately found that the impugned orders were legally unsustainable and dismissed the writ petitions.

In a case where a stone crusher company was found to be lacking in pollution control measures, the State Board had issued a show cause notice and refused to renew the company's consent to operate. However, the court found that the notice was vague and the inspection was conducted after the notice was issued. The court also found that the Board had violated principles of natural justice and fundamental rights. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the company's application for renewal of consent within four months. The court also directed the Board to inspect the sites and collect air samples to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government was directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

The court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has quashed orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board in multiple cases involving stone crushers. The court found that the Board had not followed proper procedures and had violated principles of natural justice and fundamental rights. The court has directed the Board to reconsider the matter and has ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The court has also directed the state to consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the committee's recommendations.
