In a recent court order, the petitioners in a criminal revision case were convicted under Section 51(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and sentenced to one year of simple imprisonment. The petitioners did not challenge the conviction but requested a reduction in sentence based on the grounds that they were not previous convicts, had not committed any criminal activity before or after the case, and were the only breadwinners of their families.

The court, while upholding the conviction, took into consideration the mitigating circumstances presented by the petitioners and reduced their sentence to the period already served by them. The court ordered their immediate release and directed the State counsel to send a copy of the judgment to the Superintendent of the District Jail, Kurukshetra, to comply with the order.
