The court order pertains to two cases where the petitioner filed a petition for eviction of a tenant from a commercial property on the grounds of bonafide commercial requirement of his daughter. In both cases, the respondent had filed a leave to defend application, but the court found that the petitioner's requirement was genuine and that the daughter's financial independence did not negate her dependency for accommodation.

In the first case, the court noted that the landlord has the right to judge his own requirement for residential or business purposes. The court granted the eviction petition, stating that the petitioner's requirement for the commercial property was bona fide. The respondent's leave to defend application was rejected.

In the second case, the court granted an eviction order against the respondent from a private shop. The court found that the petitioner's requirement for the shop for his daughter's business was a bona fide requirement and that the respondent's defense that the shop was his only means of livelihood was not relevant to the issue at hand. The court also rejected the respondent's claim that the petitioner had malafide intentions to re-let the shop at a higher rent. The eviction order will not be executable for six months from the date of the order.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of the landlord's right to judge his own requirement for residential or business purposes. The court also noted that the tenant's financial independence does not negate their dependency for accommodation. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner's requirement was genuine and bona fide.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of understanding the rights and responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Landlords have the right to judge their own requirement for residential or business purposes, and tenants have the right to defend themselves against eviction. However, in cases where the landlord's requirement is genuine and bona fide, the court may grant an eviction order.

It is important for both landlords and tenants to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law. Landlords should ensure that their requirements for eviction are genuine and bona fide, and tenants should be aware of their rights to defend themselves against eviction. By understanding these rights and responsibilities, both landlords and tenants can avoid legal disputes and ensure a fair and just outcome.
