The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by V. Pitchai against the State, represented by the Inspector of Police, Vigilance & Anti Corruption, Chennai City II Detachment. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Special Judge for the cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, Chennai, dated 23.05.2017 made in Crl.M.P.No.670/2017 in C.C.No.102 of 2011, with regard to Crime Nos.12/AC/2001, 14/AC/2001 & 15/AC/2001 in item No.1 mentioned in the Crl.M.P.No.670 of 2017 petition.

The petitioner had sought certain documents, including the entire case diary, statements of witnesses, and preliminary investigation records, claiming that they were relevant and essential for the case in hand. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents sought by the petitioner were neither relevant nor essential for the case in hand. The court also held that making a vague plea seeking entire case diary and the statement of witnesses or preliminary investigation records without any detail and without explaining the relevancy cannot be entertained.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide any specific details or explanations as to why the documents were relevant or essential to the case. The court noted that the petitioner had made a vague plea for the entire case diary and witness statements without providing any specific details or explanations as to why they were necessary. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to explain the relevancy of the preliminary investigation records.

The court's decision is significant because it highlights the importance of providing specific details and explanations when seeking documents in a criminal case. The court's decision also underscores the need for petitioners to demonstrate the relevancy of the documents they are seeking.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that vague and unsubstantiated requests for documents are unlikely to be entertained by the court. Petitioners must provide specific details and explanations as to why the documents they are seeking are relevant and essential to the case in hand. Failure to do so may result in the dismissal of the petition.
