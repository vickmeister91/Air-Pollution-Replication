The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving alleged violations of environmental norms and the requirement for prior environmental clearance for expansion and modernization of existing projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the EIA Notification, 2006.

In the first court order, M/S. Vedanta Aluminium Limited filed a writ petition against the Union of India and another party seeking relief from an order/directions issued on 20.10.2010 pursuant to the show cause notice dated 31.08.2010. The petitioner also sought a writ of mandamus directing the opposite party to reinstate the Terms of Reference issued to the petitioner, a declaration that the public hearing proceedings are good and valid, and a writ of prohibition restraining the opposite parties from initiating legal action under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for the alleged violation of the EIA Notification, 2006. The court order provides a detailed background of the case and the events leading up to the filing of the writ petition.

In the second court order, a petitioner began construction on an expansion project after receiving approval from a public hearing. However, a sub-committee was formed to assess pollution control measures, and the petitioner was later issued a show cause notice and directed to maintain status quo due to alleged violations of environmental norms. The petitioner argues that the expansion project does not require a new environmental clearance as it involves no change in process or technology. The petitioner also claims to have complied with all necessary clearances and regulations and has implemented state-of-the-art technologies to prevent pollution. The court is asked to consider whether the show cause notice and subsequent directions were issued without proper consideration of the petitioner's submissions and whether the petitioner's legitimate expectations were violated.

In the third court order, Brane Technology had applied for environmental clearance for the expansion of its alumina refinery capacity and captive power plant in Kalahandi, Orissa. The Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued a show cause notice to the company for undertaking construction activity without obtaining environmental clearance. The court considered several questions, including whether the provisions of the EIA Notification, 2006 were applicable to the expansion project, whether the construction work undertaken by the petitioner violated the mandates of the EIA Notification, and whether the process for environmental clearance had to be started de novo. Ultimately, the court directed the petitioner to submit a fresh proposal for obtaining environmental clearance for the expansion project under the procedure laid down in the EIA Notification, 2006.

In the fourth court order, the petitioner had undertaken expansion of its existing project without obtaining prior environmental clearance, which was a prerequisite. The court observed that the provisions contained in Paragraphs 1, 2, and 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006 were applicable to the petitioner's expansion project. The petitioner argued that it had already obtained environmental clearance for the existing project and that prior environmental clearance was not required for undertaking construction activities within an existing premise. The court rejected this argument and held that prior environmental clearance was required for expansion and modernization of the existing project. The court also noted that the petitioner had invested huge sums of money and had altered its position irreversibly, and that stoppage of work at this stage would cause irreparable hardship to the petitioner. The court directed the petitioner to comply with the requirements of the EIA Notification, 2006 and obtain prior environmental clearance for the expansion project.

In the fifth court order, POSCO, SAIL, and a petitioner violated the EIA Notification, 2006 by undertaking construction activities for expansion without obtaining environmental clearance. The court found that the petitioner's actions were illegal and justified the withdrawal of the Term of Reference and cancellation of the public hearing. The court also stated that the process for environmental clearance must be started de novo, and the petitioner must submit a fresh proposal to the Ministry under the procedure laid down in the EIA Notification, 2006. The writ petition was dismissed, and no costs were awarded.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of obtaining prior environmental clearance for expansion and modernization of existing projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the EIA Notification, 2006. The court orders also emphasize the need for compliance with environmental norms and regulations to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.
