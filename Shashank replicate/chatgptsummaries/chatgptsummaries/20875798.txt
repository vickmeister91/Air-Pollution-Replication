The Supreme Court of India recently issued two court orders pertaining to land acquisition cases. The first case involved a petitioner who had acquired land from the State of Haryana to start an educational complex. However, the petitioner failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement, and the land was subsequently resumed by the State of Haryana, except for 7 acres that were left to be retained by the petitioner foundation. The petitioner challenged the order, but the High Court upheld the resumption of the land. The Supreme Court heard the case and rejected the petitioner's proposal to construct and run a school for underprivileged children on the retained land, stating that the petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement and the land had been resumed by the State of Haryana.

The second case involved a petitioner who had taken public land in the name of education but failed to act as per the agreement and deprived the people of the village of the benefit of the common land. The court found that the petitioner had a track record of taking private benefit from the land of the village, which was taken over by the state to advance education, a public cause. The court also found that forest land was acquired without the requisite permission and that the land was being used for personal leisure and pleasure. The court dismissed the special leave petitions and ordered that the land be utilized by the competent authority in a transparent manner as per applicable policy and law.
