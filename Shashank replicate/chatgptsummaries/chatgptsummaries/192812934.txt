The Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986, allows for preventive detention of individuals who have committed crimes that are prejudicial to public order. In a recent case, J. Madanmohan filed a writ petition seeking the release of Jangala Siva Shankar, who was detained in Central Prison, Kadapa, YSR Kadapa District, under this act. The order of detention was passed by the Collector and District Magistrate, Kadapa, YSR Kadapa District, and confirmed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The grounds for detention included 23 criminal cases involving the detenu, including illicit felling of red sandalwood trees, theft, illegal transportation, smuggling, assault, and attempt to murder.

The court order listed several crimes committed by the detenu under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the A.P. Forest (Amendment) Act, 2016, the A.P. Sandal Wood and Red Sanders Wood Transit Rules, 1969, the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. The detenu was given the right to make a representation against his detention but did not avail it. The petitioner's counsel argued that the detaining authority did not satisfy himself as to the likelihood of the detenu being released on bail. However, the court noted that the essential concept of preventive detention is to prevent the detenu from repeating past acts that are prejudicial to public order. The court found that the order of detention was valid and did not necessitate interference.

The court order also stated that a detention order should not be passed just to prevent someone from being released on bail in a criminal case. However, if the circumstances demand it, preventive detention can be used. In another case, the court invalidated an order of detention because the detaining authority did not have reliable material to believe that the detenu would be released on bail and engage in prejudicial activities. The court allowed the writ petition and set the detenu at liberty unless detention is required in connection with any other case.

In conclusion, preventive detention is a legal tool used to prevent individuals from repeating past acts that are prejudicial to public order. However, it should not be used to prevent someone from being released on bail in a criminal case unless the circumstances demand it. The court order in the case of Jangala Siva Shankar found that the order of detention was valid and did not necessitate interference. On the other hand, in the case where the detaining authority did not have reliable material to believe that the detenu would be released on bail and engage in prejudicial activities, the court invalidated the order of detention and set the detenu at liberty unless detention is required in connection with any other case.
