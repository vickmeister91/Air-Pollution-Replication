The court order pertains to 62 appeals/applications that raise common questions of law and similar facts. The case involves M/s Laxmi Suiting, a proprietorship concern that applied for a plot of land in the Heavy Industrial Area in Jodhpur, which was allotted to them by the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Limited (RIICO). The lease agreement contained clauses related to pollution control and the establishment of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). The applicant's application for membership to the CETP was rejected by the Jodhpur Pradushan Niwaran Trust, which was revealed to be not functioning properly. The court order provides a detailed account of the facts and relevant clauses of the lease agreement.

The court order states that a CETP (Common Effluent Treatment Plant) was operating without proper consent from the Board and was not functioning properly. The Board had ordered the closure of the unit, but the applicant challenged the legality of the order. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that many industries were operating without obtaining consent from the Board and causing pollution. The court ultimately did not order the immediate closure of the CETP but emphasized the importance of preventing pollution and maintaining proper environmental standards.

The court order dismisses two applications challenging show cause notices issued by the Board under the Water Act. One application is dismissed as the applicant is not carrying on any business in the premises in question and has rented them out to different tenants. The other application is disposed of with a direction to file a fresh application before the Board and the Trust. The court also discusses the contention of some units that they are entitled to operate the industry despite not being granted consent by the Board, citing relevant provisions of the Water Act.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 25 of the Water Act, which prohibits any person from establishing or operating any industry or process that is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent without the previous consent of the Board. The Board may grant its consent subject to conditions and fix the duration during which such consent shall be operative. If an application for consent has remained pending for four months, it would be deemed to have been granted unconditional consent. However, the conditions stipulated in Section 25(7) must be strictly satisfied. The court also notes that Section 25(5) forms an exception to the deeming fiction created under Section 25(7) and applies to industries or units that have been established without obtaining consent of the Board. These units would be governed by the conditions stated in the Board's order of consent after issuance of
