The court order pertains to two criminal revision cases against the conviction of the accused for the commission of an offense punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused were found in possession of three leopard skins without a permit. The court evaluated the evidence on record and rejected the accused's contention that the conviction was based on a misappreciation of evidence. The court upheld the conviction and sentence imposed by the lower courts.

In the first case, the court discussed the authority to make a complaint under the Wildlife Protection Act and the validity of a complaint made by the Wild Life Warden-cum-DFO. The court concluded that the complaint made by the Wild Life Warden is valid and the accused/convicts were found in possession of leopard skins. The court also discussed the validity of the seizure memo and photographic evidence presented in the case.

The second case affirms the judgments of the lower courts and dismisses the criminal revision petitions. The court found that the evidence on record was not manipulated or fabricated and that the analysis of the material by the lower courts was not grossly perverse or absurd. The court also concluded that the seized skins were of leopard based on the testimony of an expert witness. All pending applications were disposed of and the records were to be sent back forthwith.
