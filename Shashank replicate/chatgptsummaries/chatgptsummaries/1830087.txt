The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by a petrol pump owner challenging an order by the Deputy Director of the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) to make contributions under the Employees' State Insurance Act from August 1993 to May 2000. The petitioner argued that the Act only applied to factories where a manufacturing process was carried out with the aid of power and in which ten or more persons were employed for wages. However, the court held that the definition of "manufacturing process" in the Factories Act did not depend on any end-product being manufactured and included even repair, finishing, oiling, or cleaning processes. 

The court also noted that the Act had a relevant social purpose to achieve and that the "manufacturing process" could not be interpreted in a narrow sense in respect of an act meant for purposes connected with social welfare. The Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948, is a social welfare legislation enacted to provide certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity, and employment injury. The Act applies to factories and establishments employing ten or more persons. The employer is required to contribute a certain percentage of the wages paid to the employees towards the ESIC fund. 

The petitioner contended that since the petrol pump did not carry out any manufacturing process, it was not covered under the Act. However, the court held that the petrol pump was covered under the Act as it was an establishment employing ten or more persons. The court also noted that the petrol pump carried out repair, finishing, oiling, and cleaning processes, which fell within the definition of "manufacturing process" under the Factories Act. 

The court observed that the purpose of the Act was to provide social security to employees and their families in case of sickness, maternity, and employment injury. The court held that the Act was a beneficial legislation and should be interpreted in a manner that advances its object. The court noted that the definition of "manufacturing process" under the Factories Act was wide enough to cover repair, finishing, oiling, and cleaning processes. The court held that the petitioner was liable to make contributions under the Act from August 1993 to May 2000 and that recovery could be issued under Sections 45C and 45G of the Act in case of default. 

Section 45C of the Act provides for the recovery of contributions due from an employer as an arrear of land revenue. Section 45G of the Act provides for the recovery of damages for default in the payment of contributions. The court held that the Deputy Director of the ESIC had rightly issued the order to the petitioner to make contributions under the Act and that the petitioner was liable to make the contributions. 

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court held that the Employees' State Insurance Act applied to establishments employing ten or more persons and that the definition of "manufacturing process" under the Factories Act included repair, finishing, oiling, and cleaning processes. The court held that the Act was a beneficial legislation and should be interpreted in a manner that advances its object of providing social security to employees and their families. The court held that the petitioner was liable to make contributions under the Act from August 1993 to May 2000 and that recovery could be issued under Sections 45C and 45G of the Act in case of default.
