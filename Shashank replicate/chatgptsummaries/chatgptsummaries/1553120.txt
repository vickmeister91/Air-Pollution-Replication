The Patna High Court recently heard a case regarding the liability of Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited to pay water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The company claimed that it was not liable to pay the cess as it was not engaged in a metallurgical industry and was not discharging any polluted water. The court considered the definition of metallurgical industry and various authorities on the subject, ultimately concluding that the company was engaged in an engineering industry and not a metallurgical industry. The court also noted that the company was not discharging any polluted water.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "metallurgical industry" in the context of the Cess Act. The Addl. Solicitor General of India argued that the term should be used in a wide sense and not confined to just the extraction of metal from ores. However, the court ultimately held that the technical and scientific meaning of the term must be given, which includes the extraction of ores, refining them, and converting them into steel. The court concluded that an engineering industry, such as the petitioner-company, which uses steel to manufacture finished products like automobiles, cannot be considered a metallurgical industry. Therefore, the Cess Act does not apply to the petitioner-company. The court also noted that in interpreting a fiscal statute, any doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.

The court order also discusses the interpretation of a fiscal statute and the principle that if a person falls within the letter of the law, they must be taxed, even if it causes hardship. The court found that the Cess Act did not apply to the petitioner-industry and that any doubt in interpretation must be resolved in favor of the subject. The court also found that the discharged water from the industry contained pollutants and that the industry must be held liable to pay cess for the metallurgical processes involved. However, the court found that the assessment made in a composite way was not correct and that the amount of cess assessable on the metallurgical part of the company had not been calculated. The court quashed the order and demand notice in favor of the petitioner-industry.

In summary, the Patna High Court ruled that Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited was not liable to pay water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, as it was not engaged in a metallurgical industry and was not discharging any polluted water. The court held that the technical and scientific meaning of the term "metallurgical industry" must be given, which includes the extraction of ores, refining them, and converting them into steel. The court also noted that in interpreting a fiscal statute, any doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. However, the court found that the discharged water from the industry contained pollutants and that the industry must be held liable to pay cess for the metallurgical processes involved. The court quashed the order and demand notice in favor of the petitioner-industry, as the assessment made in a composite way was not correct and the amount of cess assessable on the metallurgical part of the company had not been calculated.
