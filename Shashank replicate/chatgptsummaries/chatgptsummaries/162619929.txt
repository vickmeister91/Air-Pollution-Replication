The court order pertains to a case involving Dilip Kumar and Sunita Mittal. Sunita Mittal had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against Dilip Kumar and two others. The complaint was related to dishonoured cheques issued by Dilip Kumar in furtherance of a loan agreement. During the trial, Dilip Kumar cross-examined Sunita Mittal regarding income tax returns, and the court deferred further cross-examination for want of ITRs. Sunita Mittal filed a revision petition, and the learned Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) allowed the revision petition by setting aside the order and directing the learned Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) to afford further opportunity for cross-examination to Dilip Kumar. 

Dilip Kumar challenged the order, stating that the scope of further cross-examination had been made very limited to the extent of repayment, and the legal notice and property transactions which were subject matter of the dispute and is the foundation of the cross-examination to bring out the truth had been taken away by the impugned order of the learned ASJ. Dilip Kumar argued that the impugned order passed by the learned ASJ is bad in law as the order dated 24.05.2014 passed by the trial court was an interlocutory order to which revision should not have been entertained.

The court order explains the definitions of "interlocutory" and "intermediate" orders and their roles in legal proceedings. It also discusses the use of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to request the production of documents or other items during an investigation or trial. The order specifically relates to a case involving a complaint filed under Section 138 NI Act and the cross-examination of the complainant. The court directs that the cross-examination should be relevant to the facts of the allegation and that the accused should not use it to harass the complainant.

The court finds that the order dated 24.05.2014 is a revisionable order under Section 397 Cr.P.C. and not an interlocutory order. The court also finds that the impugned order dated 23.08.2014 passed by the learned ASJ in revision petition No. 25/14 does not warrant any interference by this Court to invoke inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The court states that the accused cannot be allowed to further cross-examine the complainant on irrelevant aspects. The court dismisses the petition.
