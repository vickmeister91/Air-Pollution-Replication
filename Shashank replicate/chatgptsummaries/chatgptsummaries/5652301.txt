The Jammu and Kashmir High Court has issued a court order pertaining to the proper management and disposal of solid waste, e-waste, and biomedical waste in the region. The order comes in response to concerns about the environmental impact of waste disposal practices in the area, particularly the dumping of waste near the river and airport.

The court has directed the Commissioner Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department to take action to address these concerns. The Commissioner Secretary has informed the court that a sanitary landfill site has been identified and acquired, and that the dumping of waste near the river and airport will be stopped. The court has directed the district authorities and police officials to cooperate with the Commissioner Secretary to ensure the landfill site is fully functional.

In addition to addressing the issue of solid waste disposal, the court has also requested plans for e-waste and biomedical waste management. These plans will be crucial in ensuring that these types of waste are disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.

The court has also expressed concern about the use of landfill sites for solid waste disposal, and has requested alternatives to be considered. This is an important step in addressing the long-term environmental impact of waste disposal practices in the region.

Overall, the court order represents a significant step forward in addressing the environmental impact of waste disposal practices in Jammu and Kashmir. By directing the Commissioner Secretary to take action and requesting plans for e-waste and biomedical waste management, the court is sending a clear message that waste disposal practices must be improved in order to protect the environment and public health.

The case will be re-notified on February 7, 2018, indicating that the court will continue to monitor the situation and take further action if necessary. It is hoped that this court order will serve as a catalyst for positive change in waste disposal practices in Jammu and Kashmir, and that other regions will follow suit in implementing more environmentally responsible waste management practices.
