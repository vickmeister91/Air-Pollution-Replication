In a recent court order, the accused were acquitted of all charges related to violating provisions under the Karnataka Forest Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The charges included theft of an antique idol and possession of wildlife produce without valid permits. The prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, leading to their acquittal. However, the bail bonds and surety bonds executed by the accused and their sureties will remain in force for six months.

The court order also stated that the case papers will be preserved for the trial of the split accused persons. The order included a list of witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution, documents marked on behalf of the prosecution, and material objects marked on behalf of the prosecution. However, there was no information provided about the defense.

The order was pronounced by A.M. Nalini Kumari on October 30, 2017, in the VII ACMM court in Bengaluru. The case had been ongoing for some time, and the court's decision to acquit the accused was based on the prosecution's failure to provide sufficient evidence to prove their guilt.

The charges against the accused were serious, and if they had been found guilty, they would have faced significant penalties under the law. However, the court's decision to acquit them highlights the importance of ensuring that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The court's decision to preserve the case papers for the trial of the split accused persons indicates that there may be further legal proceedings related to this case. It is unclear at this time who the split accused persons are or what charges they may face.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It also highlights the need for transparency in legal proceedings, as the lack of information about the defense in this case is concerning. The preservation of the case papers for the trial of the split accused persons suggests that there may be further legal proceedings related to this case, and it will be interesting to see how they unfold in the future.
