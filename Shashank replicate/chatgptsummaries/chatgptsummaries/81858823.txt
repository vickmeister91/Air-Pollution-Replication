The court order pertains to a complex dispute over land ownership and protected tenancy rights in Ranga Reddy district. The case involves multiple implead petitions and revisions related to the validity of certificates and records, and the failure of the quasi-judicial authority to act judicially. The court lists the plot numbers and documents of the implead petitioners and includes the names of petitioners who are being impleaded in the case.

One of the revisions filed by Kandada Bakka Reddy and others concerns the correction of protected tenancy (PT) lists and the granting of a 38E certificate. The petitioners had accepted the corrections and even executed sale deeds to third parties based on the corrected survey numbers. The court found that the petitioners cannot claim the wrong survey numbers which were shown in their name earlier and that the provisions of the AP (Telangana area) Tenancy Act are not applicable in view of the change of nature of the land. The court also found that the petitioners had taken advantage of the corrected survey numbers and cannot put forth any claim on the earlier incorrect protected tenancy survey numbers. The court dismissed the revisions and found that the claims made by the petitioners were false and unsubstantiated.

Another revision involves a dispute over protected tenancy rights for certain lands. The court found that the original protected tenants, Kandada Yellaiah and Thatichettu Devaiah, were entitled to the lands in question and that the unofficial respondents had no right to claim them. The court also noted that unless a protected tenancy is terminated in accordance with the law, it continues to subsist. The court set aside the 38-E certificate issued in favor of the unofficial respondents and directed the Joint Collector, RDO, and MRO to grant the Section 38-E certificates to the petitioners and mutate their names in the revenue records.

The court order also outlines the process for determining who is a protected tenant and their rights, including the right to purchase the land they are cultivating. The Tribunal will determine the reasonable price of the landholder's interests in the land, and the protected tenant must deposit the amount determined by the Tribunal. If the protected tenant fails to pay the entire amount, they forfeit the right to purchase the land. The right of the protected tenant to purchase the land is subject to certain conditions, including limitations on the amount of land they can purchase and the extent of land remaining with the landholder after the sale.

The court order discusses various cases related to the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. It covers topics such as the oral surrender theory, the reasonable time for filing applications under Section 32 of the Act, the entitlement of protected tenants to ownership certificates under Section 38-E, and the jurisdiction of the Mandal Revenue Officer in granting succession to protected tenants. The order also highlights the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case when interpreting the Act's provisions.

The court found that the petitioners are legal successors of the PT and any correction or alteration made without notifying them is illegal and violates the Act and principles of natural justice. The alleged enquiry and correction of records did not take place, and assuming it did, it was done without issuing any notice to the PT or his legal heirs. The court also denies the claim that the subject lands were converted into non-agriculture and sold to third parties. The Joint Collector dismissed the appeals by order, dt.11.07.2014, holding that if the appellants have any objection, they ought to have filed the same before the RDO at the time of publication of provisional list and final list of protected tenancy. The court allows the revisions.

The court order also discusses the duty of the Joint Collector in deciding appeals with reference to provisions and full bench judgments. The order highlights the importance of considering the facts on record and the prescribed form of application while making decisions. The court emphasizes that the interest of a Protected Tenant continues to be operative and subsisting so long as 'protected tenancy' is not validly terminated. The order concludes by allowing all the revisions and remanding the matters to the Joint Collector for fresh determination.

In conclusion, the court order deals with a complex dispute over land ownership and protected tenancy rights. The court considers various cases and provisions of the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950, and emphasizes the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case. The court allows all the revisions and remands the matters to the Joint Collector for fresh determination, clearing the cloud between the Revision Petitioners and unofficial respondents. Any pending miscellaneous petitions shall stand closed.
