The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The petitioner in this case had borrowed money from the respondent and issued cheques that were dishonored. The respondent then filed a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I.Act). 

The petitioner, in turn, filed an application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C for the production of files relating to Chit A9-t1 from Arujan Amaravathi Chits Private Limited and nine documents relating to the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Account, Memorandum of Articles, etc. The trial court dismissed the application, and the petitioner approached the High Court to set aside the order.

The High Court found that the documents called for had no nexus or relevance to the case under trial and dismissed the petition. This decision was based on the fact that the documents requested by the petitioner were not directly related to the case at hand. The court found that the documents were not necessary for the proper adjudication of the case and that their production would only serve to delay the proceedings.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the production of documents under section 91 of the Cr.P.C is subject to certain conditions. The section allows for the production of documents that are necessary for the proper adjudication of a case. However, the court must be satisfied that the documents are directly related to the case and that their production is necessary for the proper adjudication of the case.

In this case, the court found that the documents requested by the petitioner did not meet these conditions. The court found that the documents had no nexus or relevance to the case under trial and that their production would only serve to delay the proceedings. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and upheld the decision of the trial court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of ensuring that the production of documents under section 91 of the Cr.P.C is subject to certain conditions. The court must be satisfied that the documents are directly related to the case and that their production is necessary for the proper adjudication of the case. This ensures that the proceedings are not delayed unnecessarily and that the case is adjudicated in a timely and efficient manner.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that the production of documents is subject to certain conditions. It highlights the need for courts to carefully consider the relevance and necessity of documents before ordering their production. This ensures that the proceedings are conducted in a fair and efficient manner and that justice is served.
