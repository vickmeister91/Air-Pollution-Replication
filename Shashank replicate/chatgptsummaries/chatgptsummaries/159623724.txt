The Misra Charitable Trust filed a petition for the appointment of an arbitrator under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 against M/s. Manpower Pvt Ltd. The petitioner had leased out office space to the respondent, and disputes arose over unpaid rent and electricity charges, as well as the sealing of the premises by the Monitoring Committee. The lease agreement had an arbitration clause, but the respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator, leading to the petitioner filing the present petition. The court held that there were arbitrable disputes and appointed a sole arbitrator, taking into consideration the costs involved and the nature of the disputes.

In a recent court order, the appointment of a new sole arbitrator has been ordered to resolve disputes between the parties involved in a lease agreement. The previous arbitrator cannot be allowed to qualify his consent. The appointed arbitrator will decide her own fees and the procedure to be adopted, and the parties are directed to appear before her on a specified date.
