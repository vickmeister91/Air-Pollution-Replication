Three court orders were discussed in the given summaries. The first case was filed by the Mandi Valley Farms Owner's Welfare Association against the Government of NCT of Delhi. The plaintiffs claimed that the land marked red in the site plan is a part of public road and general public have the right to use the said land as a public road. The defendants claimed that the land in question is placed with the forest department of Govt. of NCT of Delhi and that the plaintiffs have unauthorizedly encroached on the land belonging to defendants. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to prove service of notice u/sec. 80 CPC on the defendants and that the widening of the road was not approved until 26.11.2002. The court did not grant the relief of declaration and injunction as prayed for by the plaintiffs.

In the second case, the plaintiffs were seeking a declaration and mandatory injunction for the use of Gram Sabha land for the construction of a road. The court found that the plaintiffs did not have the authority to use the land for public utility as it was not authorized by the Chief Commissioner. The court also found that the Gram Pradhan did not have the power to allocate the land for public utility. The court further found that the transfer of the land to defendant no. 3 was legal and binding as it was done through a notification by the Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. The court also found that the plaintiffs had concealed material facts in their pleadings.

The third court order, titled M.C. Mehta v. UOI & Ors., excluded an area from vesting in Gaon Sabhau/sec. 154 of DLRA, 1954 for the purpose of reserve forest. The defendants failed to prove their case and the issue was decided in favor of the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief of declaration and mandatory injunction as prayed for. No order was given as to cost.

In summary, the first case was dismissed due to the plaintiffs' failure to prove service of notice and the lack of approval for the widening of the road. The second case was dismissed as the plaintiffs did not have the authority to use the land for public utility and had concealed material facts. The third case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs, but they were not granted the relief of declaration and mandatory injunction.
