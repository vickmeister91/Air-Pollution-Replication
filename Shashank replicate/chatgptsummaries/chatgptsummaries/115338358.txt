The Madras High Court recently issued a common judgment in Writ Appeals filed by M/S.G.V.Granites against an order passed by the Writ Court in W.P.Nos.9374 & 5233 of 2014. The Writ Court had quashed the impugned proceedings dated 22.04.2013 issued by the Third Respondent and directed the Respondents 1 to 4 to take appropriate action against the private Respondents and not to permit any industrial activity in the 'primary residential use zone'. The Appellants argued that the Writ Court had failed to consider that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner had moved the National Green Tribunal targeting the Appellants. The Respondents argued that the area in question remains classified as a 'primary residential zone' and that the activity of the Appellant in W.A.1716/2014 which is basically an industrial activity could not be carried on. The Court ultimately upheld the Writ Court's decision.

The court order states that the location of granite polish industries in the Primary Residential Area is in violation of the Master Plan permissible usage. The Cithode New Development Plan is in accordance with the law and the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act. The court dismissed the writ appeals and directed the parties to bear their own costs. The court also granted one month's time to remove the machinery and other articles after closing the industry forthwith.
