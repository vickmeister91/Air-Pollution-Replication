The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by ten auto-rickshaw owners who were denied the issuance of Form No. P-4, which would have allowed them to obtain a permit for a new vehicle on clean fuel. The petitioners claimed that they had obtained the necessary No Objection Certificate in Form P-3 and had made efforts to get their vehicles scrapped, but were unjustifiably denied the issuance of Form No. P-4. The respondents, however, argued that the petitioners had failed to have their vehicles scrapped or converted to clean fuel, and that they cannot ply these old vehicles now that the deadline for phasing them out has passed.

The court found merit in the respondents' submission and dismissed the writ petition, stating that the petitioners could approach the Supreme Court for any extension or relief. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had failed to comply with the deadline for phasing out old vehicles and converting them to clean fuel. The court also noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claim that they had made efforts to get their vehicles scrapped or converted to clean fuel.

The court's decision is significant because it highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and deadlines. The Delhi government has been taking steps to reduce air pollution in the city, including phasing out old vehicles and promoting the use of clean fuel. The court's decision reinforces the government's efforts to improve air quality in the city and protect public health.

The court's decision also underscores the need for auto-rickshaw owners to be aware of the regulations and deadlines related to the phasing out of old vehicles and the use of clean fuel. Auto-rickshaw owners who fail to comply with these regulations and deadlines may face legal consequences, including the denial of permits for new vehicles.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental regulations and the need for individuals and businesses to comply with them. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in enforcing these regulations and protecting public health.
