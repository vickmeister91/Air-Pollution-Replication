The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by the All India Plastic Industries Association against the Government of NCT of Delhi. The court considered three questions: whether the writ petition should be entertained, whether the principles of natural justice were followed in issuing the impugned notification, and whether the notification was invalid in law. The court found that the writ petition should not be entertained, that the principles of natural justice were followed, and that the notification was not invalid in law.

The background of the case involves a PIL filed by Vinod Kumar Jain concerning the management of solid waste in Delhi, including plastic waste. The court accepted the recommendations of a committee and issued directions, and subsequently, the Delhi Government issued a notification forbidding the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags in certain places and allowing only biodegradable plastic bags in other places.

The court order pertains to a notification issued by the Lieutenant Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi, which forbids the use, sale, and storage of all kinds of plastic bags in certain places, including hotels, hospitals, restaurants, and shopping malls. The notification also allows the use of only biodegradable plastic bags in other places. The court is hearing a writ petition filed by an all India association of manufacturers of plastic bags and other plastic products challenging the notification, claiming that it has put them under great hardship and their business has come to a total standstill.

The court order discusses a preliminary objection raised by the respondents that the petitioners were fully represented in a previous PIL and cannot challenge a notification issued in compliance with the directions given by the court in that PIL. The court upholds this objection and states that the petitioners should have filed a review petition or a petition for special leave to appeal in the Supreme Court if they had any grievance with the conclusions arrived at by the earlier Division Bench. However, the court also addresses the contentions raised by the petitioners regarding the procedure given in the Environment (Protection) Rules and the natural justice.

The court order discusses the compliance of Rule 4 of the EPR in issuing a notification on the ban of plastic bags. The court states that while the physical procedure laid down in Rule 4 was not followed, the spirit of the rule was followed as the petitioners were given notice and a hearing before any decision was taken. The court also notes that the principles of natural justice are flexible and their scope and applicability depend on the circumstances of each case. The court concludes that the petitioners were given an adequate opportunity to express their views and no prejudice was caused to them. The court also discusses the validity of a direction issued by an earlier Division Bench and concludes that the direction can be sustained without the last few words.

The court order discusses a previous decision regarding the ban of plastic bags in certain areas of Delhi. The court concludes that the ban is valid and in the public interest, as it addresses the problem of solid waste management and potential health risks. The court also notes that the ban does not prohibit the manufacture of plastic bags, only their use and sale in certain areas. The court dismisses the writ petition and finds no reason to strike down the ban.

In summary, the Delhi High Court has upheld the notification issued by the Lieutenant Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi, which forbids the use, sale, and storage of all kinds of plastic bags in certain places and allows the use of only biodegradable plastic bags in other places. The court found that the principles of natural justice were followed and that the notification was not invalid in law. The court also dismissed the writ petition filed by the All India Plastic Industries Association against the Government of NCT of Delhi, finding that the ban is valid and in the public interest. The court noted that the ban does not prohibit the manufacture of plastic bags, only their use and sale in certain areas.
