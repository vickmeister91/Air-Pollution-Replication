The court order in question relates to a petition filed by M/s Sada Shiv Stone Crusher, which requested the respondents to constitute an appellate authority in accordance with Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner sought a decision on their appeal, which had been pending for some time.

During the proceedings, the court was informed that an Appellate Authority had already been constituted. As a result, the petition was dismissed as infructuous, meaning that it was no longer necessary or relevant. The petitioner was advised to approach the Appellate Authority directly to have their appeal decided.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a piece of legislation that was enacted to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. It establishes a framework for regulating emissions from various sources, including industrial plants, vehicles, and other sources of air pollution.

Section 31 of the Act deals with the establishment of an appellate authority to hear appeals against decisions made by the pollution control boards. The appellate authority is empowered to hear appeals from any person aggrieved by an order or decision made by the pollution control board under the Act.

In this case, M/s Sada Shiv Stone Crusher had filed an appeal with the pollution control board, which had not been decided for some time. The petitioner therefore approached the court seeking the constitution of an appellate authority to hear their appeal.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition as infructuous indicates that the petitioner's request for the constitution of an appellate authority was no longer necessary, as such an authority had already been established. The court's decision also underscores the importance of following due process and approaching the appropriate authorities to have appeals heard and decided.

Overall, the court order in question highlights the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 in regulating air pollution and protecting public health. It also emphasizes the need for timely and effective decision-making by the pollution control boards and appellate authorities established under the Act.
