The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by the petitioner, Chandgiram, against the order of the trial court dismissing his applications under Section 91 and 294 of the Cr.P.C. for summoning certain documents. Chandgiram is charged with offences under Section 302/506/323/325/34 IPC read with Section 27 Arms Act, and the trial court proceedings are pending.

The petitioner sought to summon various documents, including DD entries, call details, and a CD containing a statement made by an eyewitness to a TV channel. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents were not required at the stage of prosecution evidence and that the petitioner was undertaking a roving inquiry into the work of the crime team during the relevant time of the incident. The court also noted that the petition was frivolous and dismissed it with costs of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited with the Legal Services Committee.

The case at hand involves serious charges against the petitioner, including murder and various other offences. The trial court proceedings are ongoing, and the petitioner sought to summon certain documents to aid in his defence. However, the court found that the documents were not necessary at this stage of the proceedings and that the petitioner was engaging in a roving inquiry into the work of the crime team.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the documents sought by the petitioner were not relevant to the prosecution evidence at this stage of the proceedings. The court noted that the petitioner was attempting to undertake a roving inquiry into the work of the crime team during the relevant time of the incident, which was not permissible under the law.

The court also found that the petition was frivolous and ordered the petitioner to pay costs of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited with the Legal Services Committee. This decision was likely made to discourage frivolous petitions and to ensure that the legal system is not abused.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and not engaging in roving inquiries or frivolous petitions. It also underscores the need for defendants to provide relevant evidence at the appropriate stage of the proceedings to aid in their defence.
