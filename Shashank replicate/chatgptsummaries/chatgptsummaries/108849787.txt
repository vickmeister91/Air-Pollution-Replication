The court order in question pertains to a case involving the seizure of a tipper vehicle for illegal transportation of sand. The owner of the vehicle filed an application under section 457 of the Cr.P.C. for taking supurdiginama before the JMFC, which was rejected. The petitioner then filed a revision under section 397 of the Cr.P.C. before the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Deosar, District Singrauli, which was also dismissed. Finally, the petitioner filed an application under section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed that the tipper be released to the registered owner on furnishing Supurdginama subject to certain conditions. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had already been denied relief under sections 457 and 397 of the Cr.P.C., and that the only remedy available to him was under section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to release the tipper to the registered owner on furnishing Supurdginama was subject to certain conditions. These conditions included the requirement that the registered owner furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000, and that the tipper be produced before the court whenever required. The court also directed the registered owner to cooperate with the investigation and to not tamper with any evidence related to the case.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the seizure of the tipper was not in dispute, and that the only issue before the court was whether the registered owner was entitled to the release of the vehicle on furnishing Supurdginama. The court noted that the registered owner had already been denied relief under sections 457 and 397 of the Cr.P.C., and that the only remedy available to him was under section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

In reaching its decision, the court also considered the fact that the registered owner had not been found guilty of any offence related to the illegal transportation of sand. The court noted that the registered owner had only been accused of being the owner of the tipper, and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the illegal transportation of sand.

Overall, the court's decision to release the tipper to the registered owner on furnishing Supurdginama subject to certain conditions was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court's decision was also in line with the principles of natural justice and the provisions of the Cr.P.C.
