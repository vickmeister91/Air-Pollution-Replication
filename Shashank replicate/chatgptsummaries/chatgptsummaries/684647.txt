The city of Jodhpur has been grappling with chaotic traffic conditions and vehicular pollution for several years. In 1993, Mahendra Lodha filed a public interest litigation highlighting the harmful effects of vehicle emissions on human health and seeking strict compliance with the Motor Vehicle Rules. The court order pertains to this litigation and directs the authorities to consider and pass appropriate orders to regulate traffic and control air pollution.

The court order in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India and ors. gave various directions to control and regulate traffic in the city of Jodhpur. The Traffic Management Committee was directed to function more effectively and involve NGOs and organizations like N.C.C. and N.S.S.B. Transport companies were directed to shift to the new allotted place of business within a specified time frame, and heavy vehicles were not allowed inside the city unless they gave a written undertaking to not bring heavy vehicles inside the city and shift outside the city to reserved areas for such business.

The court also directed the phasing out of old vehicles, the use of valid Pollution under Control Certificates, and the prohibition of reckless driving. The court also directed the authorities to ensure that transport vehicles do not overtake any other four-wheel motorized vehicle and that city buses or tempos stop only at designated places. The court also directed the state government to provide adequate police force and equipment for traffic management and to arrange a recovery van and an intercepting vehicle for the city of Jodhpur.

The court also directed the Traffic Management Committee to explore the feasibility of opening alternative routes, shifting main offices and courts, and constructing flyovers to reduce pressure on the existing main route. These directives were aimed at reducing traffic congestion and improving the overall traffic management in the city.

In addition to these directives, the court has issued several other orders to address traffic issues in the city of Jodhpur.
