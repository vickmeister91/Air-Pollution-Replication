In a recent court hearing, a petitioner sought to quash an FIR/complaint against him for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner argued that the case was time-barred under Section 161(1) of the Bombay Police Act, and the prosecution could not be initiated after one year from the date of the alleged offense. The court agreed with the petitioner and quashed the complaint, stating that the offenses could not have been committed without being in the cloak of a public servant, and the complaint should have been filed within one year. The court also dismissed the respondent-state's application for vacating interim relief.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 161(1) of the Bombay Police Act, which states that no court shall take cognizance of an offense punishable under the Indian Penal Code unless the complaint is filed within one year from the date on which the offense is alleged to have been committed. The court noted that the offenses in question could not have been committed without being in the cloak of a public servant, and therefore, the complaint should have been filed within one year.

The court's decision to quash the complaint was also based on the fact that the petitioner had been granted interim relief, which the respondent-state had sought to vacate. The court dismissed the respondent-state's application for vacating interim relief, stating that the petitioner had a prima facie case in his favor and that the respondent-state had failed to provide any evidence to the contrary.

In another court order, the court discharged the Rule with respect to Criminal Misc. Application Nos. 4066 of 1997 and 4067 of 1997. The reasons for the discharge were not provided in the summary.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of timely filing of complaints and the need for evidence to support any claims made in court. The court's decision to quash the complaint in the first case was based on the fact that the offenses could not have been committed without being in the cloak of a public servant, and the complaint should have been filed within one year. The court's decision to dismiss the respondent-state's application for vacating interim relief was based on the lack of evidence provided by the respondent-state. The reasons for the discharge of the Rule in the second case were not provided in the summary.
