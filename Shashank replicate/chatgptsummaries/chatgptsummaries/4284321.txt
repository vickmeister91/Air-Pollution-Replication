The State of Madhya Pradesh filed a revision against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Ambah District Morena, which gave a tractor and its trolley on interim custody to the respondent. The tractor trolley was seized by Forest Officers because it was involved in a forest crime. The JMFC, Ambah did not accept the respondent's application for temporary custody, but the Additional Sessions Judge gave the vehicle on interim custody to the respondent.

The revisionary Court relied on an order passed by a single Bench of the Court in a previous case, but the Judge held that the situation was different because the property was seized under the Indian Forest Act, and not the Wild Life Protection Act. The Judge set aside the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and directed the respondent to surrender the tractor and trolley to the Forest Officers within ten days. The Forest Officers were free to inquire into the matter and take possession of the vehicle if it was lying with the police.
