The case in question involves a petition filed by Shankar Singh under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner sought to quash the proceedings pending in R.C.T.No.449/2018 before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Rampur Naikin, District Sidhi, arising out of Forest Crime No.648/2017 dated 30.6.2018 registered at Forest Range, Churhat, Rampur Naikin, District Sidhi for offences punishable under section 9, 27, 29, 39, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner was accused of being involved in the commission of the crime and was present on the spot. The case was registered against the petitioner on the basis of the statement of co-accused Sarju Kol.

The petitioner argued that the case against him was based solely on the statement of the co-accused, which was not admissible in evidence. The petitioner contended that the statement of the co-accused was recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and was not recorded in the presence of a Magistrate. The petitioner further argued that the statement of the co-accused was not corroborated by any other evidence on record.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the statement of the co-accused was admissible in evidence. The court held that the statement of the co-accused was recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and was therefore admissible in evidence. The court further held that the statement of the co-accused was corroborated by other evidence on record, including the recovery of the carcass of a wild animal and the recovery of weapons from the spot.

The court also noted that the petitioner was present on the spot at the time of the commission of the crime and was therefore a prime accused in the case. The court held that the case against the petitioner was prima facie made out and that there was no ground to quash the proceedings against him.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Shankar Singh under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, to quash the proceedings pending in R.C.T.No.449/2018 before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Rampur Naikin, District Sidhi, arising out of Forest Crime No.648/2017 dated 30.6.2018 registered at Forest Range, Churhat, Rampur Naikin, District Sidhi for offences punishable under section 9, 27, 29, 39, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court held that the statement of the co-accused was admissible in evidence and that the case against the petitioner was prima facie made out.
