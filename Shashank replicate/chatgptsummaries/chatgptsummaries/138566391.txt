The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Manoj Singh Parihar, who had been arrested in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand. The court allowed the bail application, but with certain stringent conditions that the applicant must adhere to.

Firstly, the court required a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 and two solvent sureties of Rs. 50,000 each. This is a common requirement for bail applications, as it ensures that the applicant has a financial stake in complying with the conditions of the bail.

In addition to the financial requirements, the court also imposed several other conditions on the applicant. Firstly, the applicant was directed to comply with all the terms and conditions of the bond. This means that the applicant must adhere to all the conditions set out by the court, including appearing in court when required and not committing any further offences.

The applicant was also required to cooperate fully with the investigation and trial. This is an important condition, as it ensures that the applicant does not obstruct the course of justice by withholding information or refusing to cooperate with the authorities.

Another condition imposed by the court was that the applicant must not commit any similar offences while out on bail. This is a common condition for bail applications, as it ensures that the applicant does not continue to engage in criminal activity while awaiting trial.

The court also directed the applicant not to seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial. This is an important condition, as it ensures that the trial proceeds in a timely manner and is not unduly delayed by the actions of the applicant.

Finally, the court required the applicant to appear before the trial court once every month until the conclusion of the trial. This is an important condition, as it ensures that the applicant remains engaged with the trial process and does not abscond or otherwise evade justice.

Overall, the court order in question sets out several stringent conditions that the applicant must adhere to in order to be granted bail. These conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant does not pose a risk to society and that the trial proceeds in a fair and timely manner.
