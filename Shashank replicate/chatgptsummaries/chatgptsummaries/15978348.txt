The court order pertains to a dispute over land in Delhi that was declared surplus and excluded from vesting in the Gaon Sabha by the Forest Department in 1996. The petitioners claimed to have been allotted residential plots of land under the Government's 20-Point Program in 1974-75 and have been in continuous and uninterrupted possession of their houses on the land in question. However, the respondents denied this claim and stated that the petitioners were in illegal occupation of the land.

The court found that the petitioners' claim of being allottees of the subject land under the Government's 20 Point Programme remained unsubstantiated. The impugned Notification (Annexure P-1) excluded the land from vesting in the Gaon Sabha. Therefore, the court held that the petitioners' challenge to the Notification in 2003 was hardly valid, and their last-minute effort to retain possession of the land was misconceived.

The court order states that the petitioners do not have possession of the subject land and that long duration of illegal occupation or expenditure on construction does not justify condoning or regularizing illegal occupation. The court cites previous cases where notifications declaring land as waste land or forest area were upheld, and therefore, the subject land cannot be excluded from the operation of the notification in question. The petition is dismissed with no orders as to costs.
