The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to cases involving the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act and the application of its provisions. The first case involves a compromise decree where the defendant was to sell property to the plaintiff to satisfy the decree. The decree was later amended to allow payment in instalments, but the amended decree was set aside by the Chief Court. The plaintiff then executed a sale deed for the entire decree amount, which was later restored by the Privy Council. The judgment-debtor applied for restitution, but the court held that as the amended decree was not altered by the Privy Council, the sale was valid and the judgment-debtor was not entitled to restitution without conditions.

In the second case, the court discusses multiple appeals related to a case involving the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act. The court ultimately dismisses an appeal for restitution and upholds a sale of property to satisfy a debt owed under a decree. The court finds that the judgment-debtor was obligated to satisfy the terms of the decree and that granting restitution would be unjust to the decree-holder.

The third case involves the restoration of possession of eight villages to the judgment-debtor and mesne profits decreed in his favor. The executing court decreed restoration of possession of the eight villages in favor of the appellant conditional on his paying the amount due to the decree-holder under the amended decree till the date of that order. The judgment-debtor has no means to make any payment, and an order of restitution in the manner asked for in the circumstances of this case would be contrary to the principles of the doctrine of restitution. The decree-holder has derived no advantage to which he was not entitled, and the judgment-debtor has lost nothing. The sale being inevitable under the amended decree, the judgment-debtor was not entitled to restitution. The appeals were dismissed with costs.

In all three cases, the court ultimately upholds the sale of property to satisfy a debt owed under a decree. The court finds that the judgment-debtor was obligated to satisfy the terms of the decree and that granting restitution would be unjust to the decree-holder. The court also notes that the sale was inevitable under the amended decree and that the judgment-debtor was not entitled to restitution without conditions. 

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of upholding the terms of a decree and ensuring that both parties are treated fairly in the process. While the doctrine of restitution is an important principle in law and equity, it must be applied in a manner that is just and equitable for all parties involved.
