The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Ram Narayan Rai and others against the State of Jharkhand and the Divisional Forest Officer, Deoghar. The petitioners had filed an application under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, seeking to quash the order passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Madhupur at Deoghar, in GOCR Case No.61 of 2004, whereby the cognizance had been taken against them for the offence under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act and Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The crux of the matter was whether the forest in question was a protected forest or not. The petitioners argued that the forest had been declared a protected forest by a notification issued in 1962, which had expired in 1985. They further contended that no fresh notification had been issued or the old notification revived by the State Government. Therefore, they argued that the forest could not be considered a protected forest and the charges against them were baseless.

The State Government, on the other hand, argued that the forest in question was a protected forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. They contended that the forest had been declared a protected forest by a notification issued in 1962, which had been extended from time to time and was still in force.

After hearing both sides, the court examined the relevant provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court noted that under Section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, the State Government could declare any forest land or waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the Government has proprietary rights to be a reserved forest. Similarly, under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, any forest land or waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the Government has proprietary rights can be declared a protected forest.

The court observed that the forest in question had been declared a protected forest by a notification issued in 1962. However, the notification had expired in 1985, and no fresh notification had been issued or the old notification revived by the State Government. Therefore, the court held that the forest could not be considered a protected forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court further noted that the charges against the petitioners were based on the assumption that the forest was a protected forest. Since the court had found that the forest was not a protected forest, the charges against the petitioners were baseless. Therefore, the court quashed the impugned order and the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners.

This court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position regarding the declaration of forests as protected forests under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. It emphasizes the importance of issuing fresh notifications or reviving old notifications to ensure that forests continue to be protected under the law. It also highlights the need for strict adherence to legal procedures and the rule of law in environmental matters.
