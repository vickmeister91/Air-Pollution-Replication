The court has issued several orders pertaining to cases involving forest lands in Tamil Nadu. In one case, the District Forest Officer and the State of Tamil Nadu filed a batch of Civil Revision Petitions against Muthusamy, seeking to set aside an order passed by the Additional District Judge. The delay in filing the appeal ranged between 973 to 1099 days. The subject lands were acquired by the Government in 1955 and declared as Reserve Forest Lands. The Forest Settlement Officer excluded the lands of the claimants from the Reserve Forest Area without getting sanction/approval of the Government. The court allowed a similar batch of Civil Revision Petitions in CRP No.4153 of 2011 and quashed the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition to condone the delay.

In another case, forest lands were declared as such by the Forest Department, but third parties started encroaching on the land without any right. The Forest Department filed appeals against the encroachers, but due to administrative delays, the appeals were not filed within the prescribed time limit. The court has allowed the Forest Department to contest the remaining cases on merits by condoning the delay in filing the appeals. The court also noted that in similar cases where the Department's applications for condonation of delay were allowed, the respondents did not file any Civil Revision Petition. The court also took note of subsequent events where the competent authority extended the period for filing an appeal.

In yet another case, the Forest Settlement Officer in Attur admitted 1263 claims for land, which goes against the Tamil Nadu Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act. The District Forest Officer has prepared an appeal against these orders, but the Government Pleader has stated that appeals have to be prepared against each order separately. The delay in filing the appeals is being condoned by the government. A previous case has established that Section 10 (2) of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act only applies to appeals made by claimants against rejection of their claims, not appeals made by the District Forest Officer. The reasons for delay in filing the appeals have been disputed.

In another case, the appeal was not filed in time due to the claim that the case was misplaced and could not be traced. The court below accepted the reasons for condoning the delay and exercised its discretion in the light of legal principles. The court did not find any reason to interfere with the order passed by the court below. The delay in filing the appeals was condoned to enable the petitioners to agitate all points before the court below. The court allowed the Civil Revision Petitions and the applications filed by the revision petitioners under Section 5 of the Limitation Act in unnumbered Civil Miscellaneous Appeals.

In a final case, the court has allowed a batch of Civil Revision Petitions, as the reasons given by the petitioners for the delay in filing the appeal were satisfactory. The impugned orders have been set aside, and no costs have been awarded. The order was issued on August 29, 2019.

Overall, these court orders pertain to cases involving forest lands in Tamil Nadu, where delays in filing appeals have been condoned by the court. The reasons for delay have varied, from administrative delays to misplaced cases. In some cases, the court has allowed the Forest Department to contest cases on merits despite the delay in filing appeals. The court has also clarified the applicability of certain sections of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act.
