The court order in question relates to a case where the applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking a direction to the respondent to produce certain documents. The trial court had rejected the application, and this decision was affirmed by the High Court.

The court held that the documents sought to be summoned were not necessary under the facts and circumstances of the case. The burden was on the applicant to prove his defense, and the court found that the documents in question were not relevant to this defense. As a result, the court dismissed the application.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons to a person to produce a document or other thing that is in their possession or control. This section is often used in criminal cases to obtain evidence that is necessary for the prosecution or defense of the case.

In this case, the applicant had sought to obtain certain documents from the respondent that he believed would support his defense. However, the court found that these documents were not necessary for the defense and that the burden was on the applicant to prove his case without them.

The court's decision was based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The court found that the documents in question were not relevant to the defense and that the applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to support his claim that they were necessary.

The court's decision highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support a claim for the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The burden is on the applicant to prove that the documents are necessary for their defense or prosecution, and the court will only issue a summons if it is satisfied that the documents are relevant and necessary.

Overall, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of providing strong evidence to support a claim for the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court will only issue a summons if it is satisfied that the documents are necessary and relevant to the case at hand.
