The Madras High Court recently heard a case regarding the acquisition of land for a proposed Petrochemical Park in Tamil Nadu. The State Government had invoked emergency powers to acquire the land, which was challenged by landowners and a public interest litigation group. The opposition argued that the proposed park would harm the environment and violate guidelines for Coastal Regulation Zones. The court considered the validity of the acquisition and whether the change of requisitioning body from SIPCOT to TIDCO was legal.

The court order states that the change of requisitioning body invalidates the acquisition and that the public purpose proposed by SIPCOT no longer exists due to TIDCO redrawing the project. The notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was not published correctly, and the issuance of different notifications for the same purpose is vague. The denial of the statutory right conferred under section 5A of the Act is arbitrary and unreasonable. The State Government has no jurisdiction to initiate the acquisition proceedings without due delegation of powers by the Union of India. The court discusses the concept of sustainable development and the responsibility of the government to protect and preserve the environment. The proposed Petrochemical Park is argued to provide employment opportunities and development schemes, and there will not be any environmental hazard. The court identifies issues related to the environment and the legality of the acquisition.

The court order discusses the principles of sustainable development and environmental protection, including the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle. It also mentions various laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. The court also considers a report by a committee that highlights the negative impact of industrial projects on the environment and the violation of environmental laws. The court emphasizes the need for a balance between industrialization and environmental protection.

The court order discusses the violation of the Section convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) by the proposed Petrochemical Industrial Complex in Kattupalli Panchayat, which would destroy the island and Pulicat lake, a Ramsar site of international importance. The order emphasizes the need to protect the rights of fishers and fish workers, particularly those engaged in subsistence, small-scale, and artisanal fisheries, and to ensure the sustainable and integrated use of resources. The report by NEERI justifies the proposal of setting up the Petrochemical Park, its location, and the protection and improvement of the environment, socio-economic benefit, etc. However, the court suggests approaching appropriate authorities under the Environment Act and the Rules framed thereunder to seek appropriate directions against existing major industrial units, viz., NCTPS and Ennore Satellite Port, to provide an effective effluent treatment plant. The court also highlights the need to stop the reclassification of Coastal Zones, especially CRZ I & CRZ III, and empower Panchayats to invite experts & NGOs to assist in arriving at a conclusion.

The court order discusses proposals by Tamil Nadu Petro Products Limited, Hydro S & S Industries Limited, and Van Ommeren Mac Tank Terminals Limited to establish a petrochemical park with a refinery, tank storage terminal, and PVC resin manufacturing plant. The order details the proposed processes, water and energy requirements, waste management plans, and environmental impact assessments. The order also highlights the socio-economic benefits of the project, including job creation and improved living standards for local communities. The court recommends measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of the project.

The court order discusses the proposed establishment of a Petrochemical Park and its potential impact on the environment and local communities. The court recommends measures to mitigate the environmental impact and the creation of an environmental management cell and pollution monitoring cell. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and adherence to environmental protection laws. The court ultimately approves the acquisition of land for the Petrochemical Park, citing its potential economic benefits and the minimal number of families that would need to be relocated. The court also addresses the issue of executive competency of the state government in initiating the acquisition proceedings.

The court order discusses the extent of executive power of the state and the power of the Union to confer powers on states. The court concludes that the executive power of the Union and states extends to matters in respect to which the Parliament or the State Legislatures have power to make laws. The court also determines that the power of acquisition and requisitioning of property is an independent power provided for in a specific entry and is not incidental to any other legislative power flowing from various entries in the three lists. The court rejects the argument that the impugned acquisition is without jurisdiction unless there is specific entrustment by the Union of India to the State Government under Article 258 of the Constitution of India. The court also examines the procedural compliance of Section 4(1) of the Act.

The court order discusses various arguments made by petitioners regarding the acquisition of land for a Petrochemical Park. The court overrules the contention that the acquisition is without jurisdiction and examines the procedural compliance of Section 4(1) of the Act. The court finds that the change of requisitioning body from SIPCOT to TIDCO does not vitiate the acquisition proceedings as long as the public purpose remains the same. The court also examines the compliance of three modes of publication under Section 4(1) of the Act and finds that the impugned acquisition cannot be held to be vitiated for want of compliance. The court also discusses the
