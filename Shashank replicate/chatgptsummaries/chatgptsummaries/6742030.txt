The court order pertains to four different cases where United India Insurance Co. Ltd. was held liable to pay compensation for causing the death of individuals in motor accidents. The appellants in each case have filed appeals against the judgment and award passed by the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal. The court has heard both parties and reserved its judgment.

In the first case, the appellants have raised two grounds, questioning whether the accident comes under the purview of Motor Accident Claim and whether the deceased, who was driving the vehicle and died due to his own negligence, can be termed as a third party under the MV Act. The court has heard both parties and reserved its judgment.

In the second case, the claimants filed a case for compensation due to the death of two individuals in a motor accident. The owner of the vehicle had a comprehensive insurance policy with United India Insurance Company Limited. The appellants argued that the accident was not a motor accident and that the insurance company was not liable to pay compensation. However, the court found that the accident was indeed a motor accident and that the insurance policy covered it. The court also noted that the owner and driver had not violated any terms or conditions of the policy. Therefore, the court upheld the judgment and award of the tribunal.

In the third case, the court order states that the insurance company is obligated to cover the risk of all persons boarded on a vehicle under a package policy, and that the deceased driver had a valid driving license at the time of the accident. The court also notes that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, and that the insurer did not provide any evidence to support their contention that the deceased was driving without a license or was driving recklessly. The court cites several cases to support their decision that the insurance company is liable to compensate the claimants under the package policy.

In the fourth case, the court order states that the claimants are covered under third party claims according to Section 147 (1) (B) of the Motor Vehicles Act and Section 165 (1) of the same act. The term "third party" is defined as anyone who is neither the insurer nor the insured. The deceased individuals in the case are considered third parties as they were not insured or the insurer of the offending vehicle and did not violate the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The court dismisses the appeals and orders the parties to bear their own costs.

In all four cases, the court has heard both parties and made its decision based on the evidence presented. The insurance company has been held liable to pay compensation in each case, as the accidents were deemed to be motor accidents and the insurance policies covered them. The court has also noted that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, and that the insurer must provide evidence to support their contention that the deceased was driving without a license or was driving recklessly.

Overall, the court has upheld the judgment and award of the tribunal in each case, and has ordered the insurance company to pay compensation to the claimants. The court has also clarified the definition of "third party" under the Motor Vehicles Act and has dismissed the appeals in one case. The parties have been ordered to bear their own costs in this matter.
