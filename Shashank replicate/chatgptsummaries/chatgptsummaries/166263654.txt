The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Sadhna Pandey under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Pandey had sought the quashment of an order passed by the Special Sessions Judge Bhopal in Criminal Revision No. 478/11. The order had affirmed the dismissal of Pandey's application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking direction to the respondent to produce information regarding Income Tax return and banking account.

The court observed that the impugned transaction was a personal one and not related to the firm or its business activities. The court found no error in the order passed by the trial court and dismissed the petition.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to understand the sections of the Cr.P.C. that were invoked in this case. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. This section can be invoked by the court on its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceeding.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Cr.P.C. or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, Sadhna Pandey had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. seeking direction to the respondent to produce information regarding Income Tax return and banking account. The respondent had objected to the application on the grounds that the information sought was personal and not related to the firm or its business activities.

The trial court had dismissed Pandey's application, and she had filed a revision petition before the Special Sessions Judge Bhopal. The Special Sessions Judge had affirmed the dismissal of Pandey's application, and she had then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court seeking the quashment of the order passed by the Special Sessions Judge.

The High Court, after considering the submissions made by both parties, observed that the impugned transaction was a personal one and not related to the firm or its business activities. The court found no error in the order passed by the trial court and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the principle that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. can only be invoked to seek information that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The section cannot be invoked to seek personal information that is not related to the matter at hand.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of understanding the scope and limitations of the Cr.P.C. provisions that are invoked in a particular case. It is important for litigants to carefully consider the provisions of the Cr.P.C. before filing any application or petition before the court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Sadhna Pandey seeking the quashment of an order passed by the Special Sessions Judge Bhopal. The court observed that the impugned transaction was a personal one and not related to the firm or its business activities. The court found no error in the order passed by the trial court and dismissed the petition. The court's decision reaffirms the principle that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. can only be invoked to seek information that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.
