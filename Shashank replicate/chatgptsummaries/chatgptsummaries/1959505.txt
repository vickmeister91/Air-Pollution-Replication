The Supreme Court of India recently ruled on a case involving the Rajasthan State Electricity Board and the Cess Appellate Committee regarding the liability to pay a cess for the treatment of trade effluent under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court found that the appellant had installed a plant for the treatment of sewage and trade effluent, but the question was whether the appellant could be said to have installed a plant for the treatment of trade effluent. The court allowed the appeals and remanded the cases to the Assessing Authority for fresh disposal.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, levies and collects a cess on water consumed by certain industries to augment the resources of statutory boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The appellant, Rajasthan State Electricity Board, had installed a thermal power station that consumed water from the river for condenser cooling. The Assessing Authority assessed the cess, and the appellant filed appeals and writ petitions challenging the assessment and refusal to grant a rebate. The Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the writ petitions, and the appellant filed special leave petitions in the Supreme Court. The appellant argued that they were entitled to a rebate under section 7 of the 1977 Act, regardless of whether they had secured the consent of the State Board under section 25(1) of the 1974 Act. The court did not agree and dismissed the petitions.

The court ordered the installation of an independent sewage plant and neutralization plant for the treatment of water discharged from a thermal station's condenser cooling plant. The neutralization plant was necessary to bring down the temperature of water to 40C or below before its discharge into the stream. The court clarified that the previous consent of the State Board is necessary only where any new or altered outlet is proposed to be used for the discharge of sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well. The court remitted the matter to the Assessing Authority to decide the application for grant of rebate after considering relevant material placed on record by the parties. The appellant will continue to pay 30% of the cess amount until the final determination.

In another case, the court allowed the appeal of Y. Lal. The details of the case are not provided, but it can be assumed that the appellant's appeal was successful.

Overall, these court orders deal with issues related to the prevention and control of water pollution in India. The court has clarified the requirements for obtaining consent from the State Board for the discharge of sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well. It has also ordered the installation of necessary treatment plants to ensure that water discharged from industrial plants meets the required standards. The court has also addressed the issue of rebates under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and has clarified that such rebates are subject to certain conditions, including obtaining consent from the State Board under the 1974 Act. These court orders demonstrate the court's commitment to protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with the relevant laws and regulations.
