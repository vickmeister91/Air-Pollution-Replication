The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Harish Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water, analyze them, and report back. The report reveals that the samples of water from the distributories could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work, but the analysis reports of the water samples drawn from the clean water reservoir are normal. The court orders the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state is directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal within a given time frame. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs the state/local authorities to recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court also directs the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date.

The National Green Tribunal issued an order in October 2015 to remove encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and to mark and remove encroachments. A committee was formed to monitor the issue, but the compliance report showed little progress. The Tribunal ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to collect compensation. However, the compliance report showed that the notices were not in compliance with the Tribunal's directions. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution. The State Government was ordered to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments. A compliance report was to be filed by January 2016. However, the compliance report showed little progress, and the Chief Engineer's affidavit fell short of the required details.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction over civil cases involving environmental issues. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order states that the original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not yet been decided. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The case in hand is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and the Tribunal has the power to condone the delay. The remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India. The writ petition is dismissed, and the petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by moving an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
