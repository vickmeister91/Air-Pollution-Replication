In a recent court order, a bail application filed by Narendra Sharma against the State of Madhya Pradesh was dismissed. The applicant's counsel requested the withdrawal of the bail application as there was no ground for delay. The court granted the applicant the liberty to file afresh after some material witnesses are examined.

The case involved a bail application filed by Narendra Sharma, who was seeking release from custody. The applicant's counsel argued that there was no ground for delay in granting bail and requested the withdrawal of the bail application. The court, however, dismissed the petition.

Despite dismissing the bail application, the court granted the applicant the liberty to file afresh after some material witnesses are examined. This means that the applicant can file a new bail application once certain witnesses have been examined in the case.

The court's decision to dismiss the bail application may have been influenced by the lack of evidence presented by the applicant's counsel. It is possible that the court did not find the arguments put forward by the applicant's counsel to be convincing enough to grant bail.

However, the court's decision to grant the applicant the liberty to file afresh after some material witnesses are examined suggests that the court is open to reconsidering the bail application if new evidence is presented. This is a positive development for the applicant, as it means that there is still a chance for him to be released on bail.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of presenting strong evidence when seeking bail. While the court may be open to reconsidering a bail application if new evidence is presented, it is important to make a strong case from the outset in order to increase the chances of success.
