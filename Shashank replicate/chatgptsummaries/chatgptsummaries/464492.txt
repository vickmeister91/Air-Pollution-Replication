The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where the plaintiff had initially filed a suit in the wrong court, leading to a challenge of the decree by the defendants. In the first case, the plaintiff had filed a suit seeking a decree for the realization of a loan amount, but it was initially filed in the wrong court. After being returned, it was filed in the correct court, but the defendants challenged the decree, and the appellate court held that the suit was barred by time. The plaintiff appealed this decision, arguing that the period during which the suit was prosecuted in the wrong court should be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act.

The court considered whether the court of higher grade had jurisdiction to try the suit and held that it did not oust the jurisdiction of the court of lower grade. The court also held that the period during which the suit was prosecuted in the wrong court could be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. This section allows for the exclusion of time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting another civil proceeding in good faith in a court that is unable to entertain it. The court found that the plaintiff had been prosecuting the suit with due diligence and in good faith, and that the delay in filing an appeal due to earlier filing in the wrong forum can be condoned if the mistake was made in good faith.

In the second case, the court discussed the scope of Section 15 of the Civil Procedure Code, which directs that a suit should be instituted in the court of the lowest jurisdiction competent to try it. However, it has been held that if a suit triable by a lower court is tried and decreed by a higher court, the decree is valid as Section 15 is a rule of procedure and not jurisdiction. The court also discussed the conditions that must be fulfilled to claim the benefit of sub-section 1 of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. The court found that the plaintiff had been prosecuting the suit with due diligence and in good faith, and that the delay in filing an appeal due to earlier filing in the wrong forum can be condoned if the mistake was made in good faith.

In the third case, the court discussed the applicability of Section 14(1) of the Limitation Act in cases where a party has received legal advice that later turns out to be wrong. The court cited several previous cases to support the idea that as long as the party acted in good faith and with due diligence, the time taken to pursue the case in the wrong court can be excluded from the period of limitation. In this particular case, the court found that the appellant acted in good faith and is entitled to the exclusion of the time taken to pursue the case in the wrong court. The appeal was allowed, and the decree passed by the trial court was restored.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of filing suits in the correct court and the potential consequences of filing in the wrong court. However, they also demonstrate that if a mistake is made in good faith and with due diligence, the time taken to pursue the case in the wrong court can be excluded from the period of limitation. It is important for parties to seek legal advice and ensure that they are filing their suits in the correct court to avoid any potential issues in the future.
