The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation filed by M.G.M.Nagar Nala Munnetra Sangam against the Municipal Authority, District Collector, and Municipal Commissioner of Thiruvallur District. The petitioner has requested a Writ of Mandamus to stop the construction and dumping of plastic or household articles by the Municipality in the park area of the residential area at MGM Nagar, Rajaji Salai, Thiruvallur. The Municipality has set up a Micro Compost Plant in the park, which the petitioner claims will cause nuisance to the residents and spread diseases. The Municipality has filed a counter-affidavit stating that the park is not being maintained and that the Municipality has set up four Micro Compost Plants in the Thiruvallur Municipal area to handle the increasing waste. The court has heard both sides and reserved its order.

The court heard arguments from both sides regarding the use of a park area for a micro compost yard. The petitioner argued that the land use cannot be changed without changing the master plan, while the municipality argued that proper waste management is a primary responsibility and there is hardly any land left for use as a compost yard. The court noted that municipalities have to balance the competing interests of having parks and dumping yards, but the majority of the park should be kept intact and only a small portion used for the compost yard. The court also cited a previous order stating that private parties cannot encroach on public places earmarked for parks, but a portion of the area can be used for a compost yard. The court ultimately ruled that the compost yard in a small portion of the park cannot be considered an encroachment and must be used for proper waste management.

The court order states that the petitioners cannot prevent the construction of a compost yard in a portion of a park, but they should ensure that the area remains litter-free and regular fogging operations are carried out by the Municipality to prevent the spread of infectious and contagious diseases. The court also orders that the compost yard must be cleaned twice a day and fogging should be done during sunset to avoid mosquito breeding. The residents in the area must cooperate in segregating waste into degradable and bio-degradable forms. The court emphasizes that the interest and welfare of society is paramount and that the Municipal authorities must ensure proper maintenance of the compost yard. The court also notes that the waste generated by the residents of the petitioner's layout and the surrounding areas are being dumped in and around the playground space itself. The court opines that the workers of the Micro Compost Yard will collect and segregate the garbage to ensure that the place remains neat.

The court order discusses the importance of maintaining open spaces and parks for public use and enjoyment, and the need for proper waste disposal to prevent pollution and health hazards. The court allows for the construction of a Micro Compost Yard in a playground, as long as it is maintained properly and does not cause pollution. The municipality is directed to ensure the park is well-maintained and equipped with footpaths, green belts, and play equipment. Failure to do so may result in contempt of court.
