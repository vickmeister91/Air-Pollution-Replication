The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against an order passed by the II ASJ Sidhicamp Court Rampurnaikin, District Sidhi, in Criminal Revision No.260/2017. The order in question arose out of an earlier order dated 30.08.2017 passed by Judicial Magistrate First Class, Rampurnaikin, District Sidhi in Crime No.315/2017. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 457 of CrPC for "Supurdginama" of a seized vehicle, which was rejected by the JMFC, Rampurnaikin, District Sidhi. The petitioner had requested the release of the vehicle on "Supurdginama" as it was parked in an open place in the police station and could be damaged.

The court allowed the petition subject to certain terms and conditions. It is important to note that Section 482 of CrPC empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had approached the High Court seeking relief against the order passed by the lower court.

The order passed by the lower court had rejected the petitioner's application for "Supurdginama" of the seized vehicle. The petitioner had argued that the vehicle was parked in an open place in the police station and could be damaged. The lower court had rejected the application on the grounds that the petitioner had failed to establish that the vehicle was in danger of being damaged.

The High Court, however, allowed the petition subject to certain terms and conditions. The court directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 50,000 as security for the release of the vehicle. The court also directed the petitioner to produce the vehicle before the court whenever required. The court further directed the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that the vehicle would not be used for any illegal activities.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of Section 482 of CrPC in preventing abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The High Court, in this case, exercised its inherent powers to provide relief to the petitioner against the order passed by the lower court. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for parties to establish the grounds for their applications and to provide evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, the case in question involved a petition filed under Section 482 of CrPC against an order passed by the lower court. The petitioner had sought relief against the order that had rejected their application for "Supurdginama" of a seized vehicle. The High Court allowed the petition subject to certain terms and conditions, highlighting the importance of Section 482 of CrPC in preventing abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for parties to establish the grounds for their applications and to provide evidence to support their claims.
