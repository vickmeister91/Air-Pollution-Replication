The case revolves around a dispute between K B Chandrashekar and B N Nagaraj, with the former alleging that the latter had issued cheques that bounced due to insufficient funds. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 391 Cr.P.C. to summon the income tax returns of the respondent and a company called Shivani Constructions. The petitioner argued that the income tax returns would provide evidence of the respondent's financial status and help establish the payment of consideration under the cheques.

However, the Trial Court rejected the application, stating that the petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case for summoning the income tax returns. The petitioner then approached the High Court to quash the order. The High Court dismissed the petition, stating that it is for the respondent to prove the payment of consideration under the cheques involved in the case.

The High Court also noted that the petitioner had failed to produce the documents in his custody that would establish the payment of consideration. The Court stated that if the petitioner fails to produce the documents, the Court can draw adverse inference under Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act. This section allows the Court to draw adverse inference if a party fails to produce a document that is in their custody and would have been material to the case.

The Court's decision highlights the importance of producing relevant documents in a case. In this case, the petitioner had failed to produce the documents that would have established the payment of consideration under the cheques. As a result, the Court was unable to summon the income tax returns of the respondent and the company.

The Court's decision also emphasizes the burden of proof in a case. In this case, the burden of proof was on the respondent to establish the payment of consideration under the cheques. The Court noted that it is for the respondent to prove the payment of consideration, and the petitioner's failure to produce the relevant documents did not shift the burden of proof to the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by K B Chandrashekar against B N Nagaraj. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 391 Cr.P.C. to summon the income tax returns of the respondent and a company called Shivani Constructions.
