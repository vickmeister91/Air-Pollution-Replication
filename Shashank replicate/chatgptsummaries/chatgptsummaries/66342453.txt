The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Chikkadevamma, a Schedule Caste labor cooperative society. The petition sought the expedited consideration of their application for a quarrying lease, which has been pending since 1999. The court noted that other parties have been granted quarrying leases in the same area, but also recognized that the area in question is within the eco-sensitive zone and is contiguous to Bannerghatta National Park and within 7 km of the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary.

The court order emphasized the need for an even-handed approach by the State Government in dealing with quarrying applications. The court directed the State Government to take necessary steps to ensure that quarrying is not permitted in violation of environmental laws and guidelines. The court also ordered the State Government to submit a proposal for declaring ecologically sensitive areas around National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries and to consider all pending applications, including the petitioner's, in accordance with the notification that may be issued.

The court's decision reflects the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. While quarrying can provide economic benefits, it can also have negative impacts on the environment, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. The court's order recognizes the need to protect these areas while also considering the economic needs of the community.

The court's emphasis on an even-handed approach by the State Government is significant. It suggests that the government should not show favoritism towards certain parties in granting quarrying leases. Instead, the government should consider all applications in accordance with environmental laws and guidelines. This approach can help ensure that quarrying is conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner.

The court's order also highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to protecting ecologically sensitive areas. The court directed the State Government to submit a proposal for declaring such areas around National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. This proposal can help ensure that these areas are protected from activities that can harm the environment. It can also provide clarity for parties seeking to conduct economic activities in these areas.

Overall, the court's order reflects the need for a balanced approach to economic development and environmental protection. It recognizes the importance of protecting ecologically sensitive areas while also considering the economic needs of the community. The court's emphasis on an even-handed approach by the State Government and the need for a comprehensive approach to protecting ecologically sensitive areas can help ensure that economic development is conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner.
