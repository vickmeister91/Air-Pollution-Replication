The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Divine Paradise Luxury Apartments and others seeking the quashing of a complaint case filed against them by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board under the Environment Protection Act. The petitioners argued that they already possessed an Environment Clearance Certificate and therefore the complaint was invalid. The court quashed the complaint case and disposed of the petition in the same terms as a previous order passed by the court in a similar case.

The case at hand involves allegations of environmental violations by Divine Paradise Luxury Apartments and others. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners under the Environment Protection Act, alleging that they had violated various environmental norms. The petitioners, however, argued that they had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate from the relevant authorities and therefore the complaint was baseless.

The court, after hearing both sides, quashed the complaint case and disposed of the petition in the same terms as a previous order passed by the court in a similar case. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate, which meant that they had complied with all the relevant environmental norms and regulations. Therefore, the complaint filed against them by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was invalid.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate before undertaking any construction or development activity. The certificate is a mandatory requirement under the Environment Protection Act and is issued by the relevant authorities after a thorough assessment of the potential environmental impact of the proposed activity. The certificate ensures that the activity is carried out in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and does not cause any harm to the environment.

The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed the complaint against the petitioners after finding evidence of environmental violations. However, the court's decision to quash the complaint case suggests that the evidence was not strong enough to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. This underscores the need for stronger evidence-gathering mechanisms and more effective enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations. It also highlights the need for effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure that those who violate environmental norms are held accountable for their actions.
