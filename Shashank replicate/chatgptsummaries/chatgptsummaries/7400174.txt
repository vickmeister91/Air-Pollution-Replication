The first court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s Kanti Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and another against the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board for quashing a criminal complaint filed against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The applicants argued that the Managing Director of the company should not be held responsible as he was not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the factory and that the officers of the respondent did not follow proper procedure for taking samples.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, quashed the complaint against the Managing Director and allowed the respondent to initiate proceedings against the person responsible for day-to-day affairs appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company. The court did not consider the objections raised by the applicants pertaining to the process of sampling and mode of sampling as they were issues to be addressed during trial.

The court order was issued by Judge Tulsa Singh and digitally signed on March 14, 2019, at 4:44 PM. The order pertains to a person named Vishnu Pratap Singh Chauhan, but no further information is provided.

The court order in the first case is significant as it clarifies the responsibility of the Managing Director of a company in cases of violation of environmental laws. The court held that the Managing Director cannot be held responsible if he is not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the factory. This is an important clarification as it will prevent unnecessary harassment of Managing Directors who are not directly involved in the operations of the company.

The court also upheld the importance of proper procedure for taking samples in cases of environmental violations. The court did not consider the objections raised by the applicants pertaining to the process of sampling and mode of sampling as they were issues to be addressed during trial. This is an important reminder to all parties involved in environmental cases to follow proper procedure to ensure that justice is served.

In the second court order, no information is provided about the case or the person named Vishnu Pratap Singh Chauhan. It is unclear what the court order pertains to and what the implications of the order are.

In conclusion, the first court order clarifies the responsibility of the Managing Director of a company in cases of environmental violations and upholds the importance of proper procedure for taking samples. The second court order, however, lacks information and context, making it difficult to understand its significance.
