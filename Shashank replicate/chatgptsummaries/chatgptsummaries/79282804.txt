The case in question involves a petitioner who challenged the legality of an order passed by the Collector and District Magistrate, Allahabad, regarding compensation for the accidental death of his son due to electrocution. The petitioner sought an enhancement of the compensation to Rs. 5 lakhs, but the Collector awarded Rs. 1 lakh. The court found that the Collector did not provide a reasoned justification for the award and remitted the proceedings back to the Collector for a fresh assessment of the compensation payable under the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The court clarified that it did not set aside the findings of fact in the order of the Collector.

The petitioner's son had died due to electrocution, and the petitioner had sought compensation for the same. The Collector had awarded Rs. 1 lakh as compensation, which the petitioner found to be inadequate and sought an enhancement to Rs. 5 lakhs. The court found that the Collector had not provided a reasoned justification for the award and remitted the proceedings back to the Collector for a fresh assessment of the compensation payable under the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991.

The court clarified that it did not set aside the findings of fact in the order of the Collector. This means that the court did not dispute the facts of the case as found by the Collector. However, the court found that the Collector had not provided a reasoned justification for the award of compensation, which is required under the law.

The court's decision is based on the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. This section provides for the payment of compensation in case of death or injury to a person as a result of an accident occurring while handling any hazardous substance. The amount of compensation payable is determined by the Collector, who is required to provide a reasoned justification for the same.

In this case, the court found that the Collector had not provided a reasoned justification for the award of compensation. The court, therefore, remitted the proceedings back to the Collector for a fresh assessment of the compensation payable. The Collector will now have to provide a reasoned justification for the amount of compensation awarded.

It is important to note that the court did not set aside the findings of fact in the order of the Collector. This means that the facts of the case as found by the Collector are still valid. The only issue is with the amount of compensation awarded, which the court found to be inadequate.

In conclusion, the court has remitted the proceedings back to the Collector for a fresh assessment of the compensation payable under the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The court has clarified that it did not set aside the findings of fact in the order of the Collector. The Collector will now have to provide a reasoned justification for the amount of compensation awarded.
