In a case filed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Sayeed and three others were accused of violating the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 by possessing tiger body parts. The complaint was based on the recovery of tiger body parts from two individuals who disclosed that they had procured them from Sayeed. The accused were summoned and the case property was sent for lab analysis, which confirmed that the seized bones and skulls were derived from a tiger. The complainant presented nine witnesses in support of the allegations.

The court order describes the testimony of several witnesses in the case involving the recovery of tiger bones and skulls from the homes of several accused individuals. The witnesses include police officers who conducted the raid and seized the contraband, as well as a wildlife expert who analyzed the bones and confirmed they were from a tiger. The defense called two witnesses who claimed to have been present during the raid but denied any knowledge of the contraband. The court also allowed the prosecution to provide additional evidence in the form of a general diary entry.

The court order discusses the testimonies of witnesses and the admissibility of evidence in a case involving the possession of tiger bones. The court found that the recovery of tiger bones from two of the accused was admissible as it was based on the disclosure statement of another accused. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the third accused had possession of the tiger bones. The court also discussed the relevant provisions of the Indian Evidence Act and the importance of the quality of witnesses over the number of witnesses.

The court order states that the recovery of tiger bones from accused Pappu and Akhtar Ali was made based on the disclosure of accused Sayeed, and this disclosure is admissible in evidence. However, the complainant failed to prove the allegations against accused Mohd. Alam beyond reasonable doubt. The expert witness confirmed that the recovered case property was of tiger bones. The non-joining of independent public witnesses is not fatal to the prosecution case, and police witnesses are as trustworthy and credible as any independent witness. The prosecution witnesses remained consistent regarding the recovery of tiger bones from the possession of accused persons. Accused Sayeed, Pappu, and Akhtar Ali are held guilty and convicted for the offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, while accused Mohd. Alam stands acquitted. The case property, if any, is confiscated to the State under the Wildlife (Protection) Act.

The case highlights the importance of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The possession of tiger body parts is a serious offense under the Act, and the court's decision to convict the accused sends a strong message to those involved in wildlife trafficking. The recovery of tiger bones and skulls from the accused individuals was based on the disclosure statement of another accused, which was found to be admissible in evidence. The court also emphasized the importance of the quality of witnesses over the number of witnesses, highlighting the need for credible and trustworthy witnesses in such cases.

The court's decision to convict three of the accused and acquit one shows the importance of presenting strong evidence in court. The complainant was able to prove the allegations against three of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, while the evidence against the fourth accused was not strong enough to secure a conviction. The court's decision to confiscate any case property to the State under the Wildlife (Protection) Act further emphasizes the seriousness of the offense and the need to deter others from engaging in similar activities.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats. The conviction of the accused sends a strong message to those involved in wildlife trafficking and emphasizes the need for credible and trustworthy witnesses in such cases. The court's decision to confiscate any case property to the State under the Wildlife (Protection) Act further emphasizes the seriousness of the offense and the need to deter others from engaging in similar activities.
