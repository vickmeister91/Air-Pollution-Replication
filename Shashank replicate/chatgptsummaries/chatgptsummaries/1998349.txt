The court order in question pertains to a writ appeal filed by the Director and Registrar of the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology (NERIST) challenging a contempt of court order issued against them. The contempt of court order was issued by a learned single judge who found that the appellants were trying to mislead the court by contending that no post of Senior Instructor Grade-I ever existed in NERIST. The learned single judge directed the issuance of notice on the Director and Registrar of NERIST to show cause as to why a proceeding under the Contempt of Courts Act should not be initiated against them.

However, the court found that the learned single judge's conclusion was factually erroneous and unreasonable. The court held that the procedure adopted by the learned single judge to deal with the suo moto contempt proceeding was illegal. The court found that the learned single judge had not followed the proper procedure for initiating and handling suo moto criminal contempt proceedings.

The court order discusses the proper procedure for initiating and handling suo moto criminal contempt proceedings. It references previous Supreme Court cases and the Contempt of Courts Rules, 1977, to establish that even in cases of suo moto contempt, a specific procedure must be followed, including scrutiny by the court registrar and approval by the Chief Justice or a nominated judge. The court finds that the procedure followed by the learned single Judge in this case was contrary to the law and sets aside the impugned order. The writ appeal is allowed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper procedures in contempt of court proceedings, even in cases of suo moto contempt. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for judges to carefully consider the facts of a case before issuing a contempt of court order. In this case, the court found that the learned single judge had not properly considered the facts of the case and had issued an order based on a factual error.

The court's decision also has implications for the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology (NERIST). The court's decision means that the Director and Registrar of NERIST will not face contempt of court proceedings. However, the court's decision does not address the underlying issue of whether or not a post of Senior Instructor Grade-I ever existed in NERIST. This issue may need to be addressed in a separate proceeding.

Overall, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures in contempt of court proceedings and carefully considering the facts of a case before issuing a contempt of court order. The court's decision also highlights the need for judges to be vigilant in ensuring that the law is followed in all cases, including cases of suo moto contempt.
