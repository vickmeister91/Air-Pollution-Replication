The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to fair price shop dealers and their rights to a fair hearing in cases of suspension or cancellation of their dealership authorization. The first order, in the case of M. Sadasiva Sekhar against the District Collector and others, examined whether the Revenue Divisional Officer was required to afford an opportunity of being heard to the fair price shop dealer when passing orders under Sub-clause (4) of Clause 3 of the Control Order. The court held that while oral personal hearing is not compulsory in all circumstances, an opportunity of making a representation is equally efficacious and amounts to hearing. However, where a provision of law or a rule specifically provides that oral personal hearing should be afforded, strict compliance is required.

The second court order discussed the issue of whether a person who makes a petition for revision is entitled to a personal hearing before an order is passed. The court concluded that while a person is entitled to an opportunity to make a representation, a personal hearing is not necessarily required. The court also discussed the principle of natural justice and the need for a fair hearing, which includes an opportunity to be heard and a reasonable opportunity to defend oneself. The court noted that a violation of natural justice does not automatically render an order void, and that prejudice must be proven. The court concluded that the appointing authority has discretion in conducting an enquiry and may or may not afford a fair price shop dealer an opportunity to be heard.

The third court order discussed the importance of affording an opportunity of being heard to an aggrieved party, even if delegated legislation is silent on the matter. However, if the rule itself excludes personal hearing, the court cannot read into it an opportunity of being heard by the authority. The case in question involved a fair price shop dealer who was not given an opportunity of oral hearing, causing prejudice to him. The court set aside the impugned order and remitted the matter to the Revenue Divisional Officer to conduct a fresh enquiry giving an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of fair hearings and opportunities to be heard for fair price shop dealers in cases of suspension or cancellation of their dealership authorization. While a personal hearing may not always be required, an opportunity to make a representation is necessary for a fair hearing. The court also emphasized the principle of natural justice and the need for a reasonable opportunity to defend oneself. In cases where delegated legislation is silent on the matter, the court still upholds the importance of affording an opportunity of being heard to an aggrieved party. However, if the rule itself excludes personal hearing, the court cannot read into it an opportunity of being heard by the authority.
