The National Green Tribunal in India recently issued a court order regarding appeals made by several stone crushing businesses in Haryana against an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). The businesses challenged the legality of the order, which was upheld by the appellate authority. The court disposed of the appeals, as they all arose from similar facts and raised common legal issues. The lead case involved M/s Jai Mata Di Stone Crushers, which had obtained a No Objection Certificate from the HSPCB in 1996 but faced legal challenges from villagers in 2007. The court considered various notifications and guidelines issued by the State Government regarding the installation and operation of stone crushers and ultimately upheld the order of the HSPCB.

The court order also discusses a case where a stone crusher unit was accused of violating environmental regulations. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board issued a show cause notice to the unit, alleging that it was running in violation of government notifications and had obtained consent under false pretenses. The unit submitted replies denying the allegations, but the Board ultimately refused to grant consent for the year 2011-12. The court order provides details of the show cause notices and the Board's decision.

The court order pertains to the refusal of consent for the year 2011-12 under Section 21/22 of Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to M/s. Jai Mata Di Stone Crusher, Doiwala, Yamuna Nagar. The order states that the unit failed to comply with various provisions of the Air Act 1981 and the sitting parameters of the Notification dated 18.12.1997. The order was challenged by the appellant, but the appellate authority upheld the order. The order lists three violations committed by the stone-crusher owners, and the appellate authority concurred with the findings of the HSPCB. The order emphasizes the importance of human health over private business interests.

The court order states that stone crushers emit harmful dust and noise that can cause respiratory diseases and hearing impairment in workers and nearby residents. The court also notes that the protective measures and anti-pollution devices required for stone crushers have not been adhered to. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting human health over private business interests and cites a recent judgment that highlights the adverse impact of stone crushers on schools and children. The court also discusses the limitations on the power of competent authorities to permit installation and operation of stone crushers at a distance less than the prescribed distance. Finally, the court notes that the appeals in this case may be barred by time and that the tribunal may not have jurisdiction to condone the delay.

The court order also discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and concludes that the provisions of the Limitation Act cannot be invoked if they conflict with the special law's provisions. The court also emphasizes that the use of negative language in a provision indicates that it is mandatory and cannot be overridden by equitable principles. The court dismisses several appeals on the grounds of limitation and states that the parties must bear their own costs.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and protecting human health over private business interests. The court emphasizes the need for stone crushers to comply with protective measures and anti-pollution devices and adhere to the prescribed distance limitations. The court also clarifies the limitations on the power of competent authorities to permit installation and operation of stone crushers. Finally, the court discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and emphasizes the mandatory nature of provisions with negative language.
