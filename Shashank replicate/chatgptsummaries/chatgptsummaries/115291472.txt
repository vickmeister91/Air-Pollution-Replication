The court recently heard a petition filed by Purushan Eloor against Kalamassery Municipality, which sought the implementation of Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000, removal of waste from dumping sites, and appropriate pollution prevention provisions. The petitioner argued that the municipality had failed to comply with the rules and regulations regarding waste management, leading to severe environmental degradation and health hazards for the residents of the area.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately decided that the matter should be handled by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), as the state and municipality were already involved in a related case before the tribunal. The writ petition was closed, but the petitioner was given the liberty to approach the NGT if desired.

The court order included exhibits submitted by the petitioner, which included a Google Map printout showing a waste dump site, a news report about fish kill in a river, photographs of waste littered along a highway, an action plan by the government, and a direction issued to the first respondent. However, there were no exhibits submitted by the respondents.

The court's decision to refer the matter to the NGT is significant as it highlights the importance of addressing environmental issues through specialized bodies that have the expertise and resources to deal with such matters. The NGT is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and has the power to hear cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment and compensation for damages caused to people or property due to environmental degradation.

The court's decision also underscores the need for effective waste management practices in India. Improper waste disposal has become a major environmental and health hazard in the country, with many cities and towns struggling to manage the huge amounts of waste generated every day. The Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000 were introduced to address this issue and provide a framework for the proper management of solid waste. However, the implementation of these rules has been poor, and many municipalities have failed to comply with them, leading to severe environmental degradation and health hazards.

The exhibits submitted by the petitioner highlight the extent of the problem in Kalamassery Municipality. The Google Map printout shows a waste dump site, which is a clear violation of the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000. The news report about fish kill in a river is also a cause for concern, as it suggests that the waste dumped in the river is causing harm to aquatic life. The photographs of waste littered along a highway are a clear indication of the poor waste management practices in the area.

The action plan by the government and the direction issued to the first respondent are positive steps towards addressing the issue of waste management in the area. However, more needs to be done to ensure that the rules and regulations are followed and that the environment and public health are protected.

In conclusion, the court's decision to refer the matter to the NGT is a positive step towards addressing the issue of waste management in Kalamassery Municipality. The exhibits submitted by the petitioner highlight the extent of the problem and the urgent need for effective waste management practices in the area. It is hoped that the NGT will take appropriate action to ensure that the rules and regulations are followed and that the environment and public health are protected.
