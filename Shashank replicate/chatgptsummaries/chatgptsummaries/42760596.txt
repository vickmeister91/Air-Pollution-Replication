The court order in question relates to a case involving M/s Sri Sai Enterprises, which had been shut down without following the proper procedure laid out in Sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner in the case had applied for a renewal of their valid NOC (No Objection Certificate), but the respondents had not passed any order on the matter and were instead relying on an office memorandum issued by the Central Government.

In response to the petitioner's claims, the court granted an interim order of stay and directed the respondents to allow the petitioner-unit to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. This decision was made in order to prevent any further harm or damage to the petitioner's business, which had been shut down without proper cause or procedure.

The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a piece of legislation that was enacted in order to regulate and control air pollution in India. It lays out a number of provisions and guidelines for businesses and individuals to follow in order to minimize their impact on the environment and prevent harm to public health.

One of the key provisions of the Act is Sub-section (4) of Section 21, which outlines the procedure that must be followed in order to shut down a business that is found to be in violation of the Act. This procedure includes providing the business with a notice of violation, giving them an opportunity to respond and rectify the issue, and only shutting them down as a last resort.

In the case of M/s Sri Sai Enterprises, it appears that this procedure was not followed. The petitioner had applied for a renewal of their NOC, but the respondents had not passed any order on the matter and were instead relying on an office memorandum issued by the Central Government. This memorandum may have provided some guidance or direction on how to handle the situation, but it does not appear to have followed the proper procedure laid out in the Act.

As a result, the court granted an interim order of stay and directed the respondents to allow the petitioner-unit to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. This decision was made in order to prevent any further harm or damage to the petitioner's business, which had been shut down without proper cause or procedure.

It is important to note that this is only an interim order, and the case will continue to be heard in court. The final decision on the matter will depend on a number of factors, including the evidence presented by both parties and the interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a case involving M/s Sri Sai Enterprises, which had been shut down without following the proper procedure laid out in Sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court granted an interim order of stay and directed the respondents to allow the petitioner-unit to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. This decision was made in order to prevent any further harm or damage to the petitioner's business, which had been shut down without proper cause or procedure. The final decision on the matter will depend on a number of factors, including the evidence presented by both parties and the interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.
