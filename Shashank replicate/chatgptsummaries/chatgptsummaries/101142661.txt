The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Mr. Ravindra Paliwal against an order passed by the trial court rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to handover the original Will to the Police for investigation in FIR No. 26/2011. The court dismissed the writ petition on account of delay and laches as it was filed almost three and a half years after the order was passed by the trial court. The stay petition was also dismissed and no costs were awarded.

The case in question revolves around an application filed by Mr. Ravindra Paliwal under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking the original Will of his father, who had passed away in 2009. The Will was allegedly executed in 2008 and named Mr. Paliwal as the sole beneficiary of his father's estate. However, Mr. Paliwal's siblings had raised objections to the Will and had filed a complaint with the police alleging that it was forged.

The police had registered an FIR in this regard in 2011 and had conducted an investigation. However, Mr. Paliwal had claimed that the police had not investigated the matter properly and had not taken into account certain crucial pieces of evidence. He had therefore filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking the original Will to be handed over to the police for further investigation.

The trial court had rejected Mr. Paliwal's application on the grounds that the police had already investigated the matter and that there was no need for further investigation. Mr. Paliwal had then filed a writ petition challenging this order.

However, the High Court dismissed Mr. Paliwal's writ petition on account of delay and laches. The court noted that the writ petition had been filed almost three and a half years after the order was passed by the trial court and that there was no explanation for the delay. The court also noted that Mr. Paliwal had not sought any interim relief during this period and had allowed the investigation to continue without any objection.

The court further observed that the delay had caused prejudice to the other parties involved in the case, as they had already incurred expenses and had taken steps to defend themselves against the allegations made by Mr. Paliwal. The court therefore held that Mr. Paliwal's writ petition was liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches.

Mr. Paliwal had also filed a stay petition seeking to stay the trial court's order rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. However, the High Court dismissed this petition as well, noting that the main writ petition had been dismissed on account of delay and laches and that there was no merit in the stay petition.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Mr. Ravindra Paliwal challenging the trial court's order rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to handover the original Will to the police for investigation. The High Court dismissed Mr. Paliwal's writ petition on account of delay and laches, noting that it had been filed almost three and a half years after the trial court's order and that there was no explanation for the delay. The court also dismissed Mr. Paliwal's stay petition, noting that there was no merit in it.
