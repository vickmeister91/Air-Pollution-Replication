The court order in question relates to a petition filed by M/s Kaila Devi Stone, which sought relief from environmental pollution allegedly caused by respondent No.6. The Pollution Control Board objected to the relief sought, stating that it fell under the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. As a result, the court directed the petitioner to seek redressal of their grievance before the National Green Tribunal under the Act of 2010.

The case at hand involves allegations of environmental pollution caused by respondent No.6, which has prompted M/s Kaila Devi Stone to seek relief from the court. However, the Pollution Control Board has argued that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal, and therefore the court cannot provide the relief sought by the petitioner.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, with the aim of providing effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The tribunal has the power to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues, including disputes arising from the implementation of laws and policies aimed at protecting the environment.

In light of the Pollution Control Board's objection, the court has directed the petitioner to seek redressal of their grievance before the National Green Tribunal. This decision is in line with the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, which clearly stipulate that the tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to environmental protection and conservation.

The court's decision highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal in addressing environmental issues and ensuring that laws and policies aimed at protecting the environment are effectively implemented. By directing the petitioner to seek redressal before the tribunal, the court has ensured that the matter will be heard by a specialized body with the necessary expertise and experience to deal with environmental issues.

Overall, the court order in question underscores the need for effective mechanisms to address environmental issues and protect natural resources. The National Green Tribunal has an important role to play in this regard, and its jurisdiction over matters relating to environmental protection and conservation must be respected and upheld.
