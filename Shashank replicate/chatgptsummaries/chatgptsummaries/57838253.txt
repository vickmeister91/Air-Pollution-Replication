The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) against M/s Aditi Polymers for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The accused was found to be using and storing plastic carry bags, which was a violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable, but the complainant argued that the complaint was filed by an authorized officer of the DPCC in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board. The court considered the arguments and relevant provisions of the law and decided that the complaint was maintainable.

The second court order discusses the conditions under which a court can take cognizance of an offense under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. Section 19 states that no court can take cognizance of an offense under this Act except on a complaint made by the Central Government, an authorized authority or officer, or a person who has given notice of the alleged offense and their intention to make a complaint. Section 24 states that the provisions of this Act and its rules shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other enactment, except where an act or omission constitutes an offense punishable under both this Act and another Act, in which case the offender will be punished under the other Act. The court also cites two previous cases to clarify the interpretation of Section 20(1) of the Act, which states that no prosecution for an offense under this Act, except for certain sections, shall be instituted except by or with the written consent of the Central or State Government or a person authorized by them. The court concludes that a person authorized to institute a complaint under Section 20(1) can give their written consent for the prosecution, and that the delegation of this power is not contrary to the Act.

The third court order discusses the delegation of powers under the provisions of an Act, specifically the Municipal Act. It states that certain powers can be delegated to municipal officers, but only under certain conditions and limitations. The court also discusses the issue of who has the authority to file a complaint under the Act, stating that only authorized persons can do so and that technicalities cannot be used to cure defects in the filing of a complaint. The court cites previous cases to support its decision.

The fourth court order states that the complainant must meet the eligibility criteria prescribed by the statute to request the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offense. In this case, the present complaint was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act. The DPCC exceeded its power by passing a resolution in the board meeting to sub-delegate their power to the area AEE, and the present complaint was filed through the area AEE, which is not permissible under the law. The court held that the present complaint is not maintainable, and since the complaint itself is not maintainable, no charge can be framed. Both accused stand discharged, and bail bonds stand canceled.

In summary, these court orders deal with various legal issues related to the filing of complaints and the delegation of powers under different Acts. The first court order deals with the violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the maintainability of a complaint filed by an authorized officer of the DPCC. The second court order clarifies the conditions under which a court can take cognizance of an offense under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the delegation of power to institute a complaint. The third court order discusses the delegation of powers under the Municipal Act and the authority to file a complaint. The fourth court order deals with the eligibility criteria for filing a complaint under the EP Act and the sub-delegation of powers by the DPCC. Overall, these court orders provide important insights into the legal framework governing the filing of complaints and the delegation of powers under different Acts.
