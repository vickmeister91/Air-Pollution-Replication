The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Sukhdev Singh against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and analyze water samples from the distributories and potable water rendered therefrom.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them. The report shows that the water in the clean water reservoir is normal, but the court wants to know the standard of water running through the distributories. The state is given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the dispatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009. The court orders the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date.

The court order from October 8th, 2015, pertains to the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and the marking and removal of encroachments in other areas. A committee was formed to monitor the removal of encroachments, but the compliance report showed little progress. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation for causing pollution. The compliance report showed inadequate action, and the court ordered the State Government to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The court also directed the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and ordered a compliance report. A subsequent compliance report was found to be lacking, and the court ordered an affidavit from the Chief Engineer to provide complete details of the action taken by the government.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief since the State Authorities are taking action pursuant to the directions given by the NGT. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order discusses a case where an original applicant filed a petition for writ alleging violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The case was transferred to the tribunal, which has jurisdiction over civil cases involving a substantial question relating to the environment. The tribunal has the power to condone delay in filing and is under statutory obligation to apply principles of sustainable development, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle. The court concludes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is efficacious and that the writ petition is dismissed. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015 by December 31, 2016. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until December 31, 2016. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the court requests that the NGT consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner(s) sympathetically.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the lack of compliance with directions issued by the National Green Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The court directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them, and the state is given a timeline to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court imposes damages or compensation on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the dispatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009 and orders the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date. The court concludes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is efficacious and dismisses the writ petition, allowing the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015 by
