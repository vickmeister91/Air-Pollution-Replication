The first court order pertains to a contempt petition filed by M. Baskaran against P. Thirumavalavan, Registrar of Bharathiar University, and K.C. Palanisamy, Chairman/Principal-in-Charge of Cheran's Arts and Science College. The petitioner alleged that the respondents violated a court order dated 26 April 2011, which directed the university to permit the petitioner to write the final semester examination without prejudice to the rights of the parties. The court found that the second respondent had committed contempt of court by wilfully disobeying the court order and not permitting the petitioner to appear for the examinations held on 4 May 2011. Instead of punishing the second respondent for contempt, the court directed the second respondent to pay a compensation of Rs.15,000/- to the petitioner within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The second court order is a pre-delivery order in Cont.P.No.942 of 2011, and the judge presiding over the case is N. Paul Vasanathakumar. The order directs a copy to be issued on the same day, which is 13-9-2011.

The first court order deals with a case of contempt of court. The petitioner, M. Baskaran, had filed a contempt petition against P. Thirumavalavan, Registrar of Bharathiar University, and K.C. Palanisamy, Chairman/Principal-in-Charge of Cheran's Arts and Science College. The petitioner alleged that the respondents had violated a court order dated 26 April 2011, which directed the university to permit the petitioner to write the final semester examination without prejudice to the rights of the parties.

The court found that the second respondent, K.C. Palanisamy, had committed contempt of court by wilfully disobeying the court order and not permitting the petitioner to appear for the examinations held on 4 May 2011. The court, however, did not punish the second respondent for contempt. Instead, the court directed the second respondent to pay a compensation of Rs.15,000/- to the petitioner within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision not to punish the second respondent for contempt may seem lenient, but it is important to note that the court has the discretion to decide the appropriate punishment for contempt of court. In this case, the court may have considered the fact that the violation of the court order did not cause any harm to the petitioner, as the petitioner was eventually allowed to write the final semester examination.

The second court order is a pre-delivery order in Cont.P.No.942 of 2011, and the judge presiding over the case is N. Paul Vasanathakumar. The order directs a copy to be issued on the same day, which is 13-9-2011. The details of the case are not provided in the order, so it is difficult to comment on the nature of the case or the implications of the order.

In conclusion, the first court order deals with a case of contempt of court, where the second respondent was directed to pay a compensation of Rs.15,000/- to the petitioner for wilfully disobeying a court order. The second court order is a pre-delivery order in Cont.P.No.942 of 2011, and the details of the case are not provided in the order.
