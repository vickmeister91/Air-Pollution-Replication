The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference.

Harjiram and Rugharam were arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The specific details of their offence are not mentioned in the court order. However, it can be assumed that they were involved in some form of illegal activity related to wildlife.

The accused filed a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C, which allows a person to apply for bail in a non-bailable offence. The court granted the bail application and directed the accused to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each. This means that the accused have to provide a written promise to appear before the trial court on each date of hearing until the completion of the trial. They also have to provide two people who will act as sureties, meaning they will be responsible for ensuring that the accused appear before the court on each date of hearing.

The granting of bail is not an indication of the accused's innocence. It simply means that they will be released from custody until the completion of the trial. The trial will determine whether they are guilty or not.
