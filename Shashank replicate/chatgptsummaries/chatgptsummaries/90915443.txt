In a recent court order, the applicant, Bharat Singh Tomar, was seeking anticipatory bail in connection with a wildlife protection and forest act violation case. The prosecution alleged that Tomar was involved in illegal sand transportation from a prohibited area and valuable herbs were found in the sand. However, the court rejected the bail application, stating that the investigation is not yet over and custodial interrogation may be necessary.

The case at hand involves a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Forest Act. The prosecution alleges that Tomar was involved in illegal sand transportation from a prohibited area, and that valuable herbs were found in the sand. The prosecution further argues that Tomar's involvement in the illegal transportation of sand and the presence of valuable herbs in the sand are clear indications of his involvement in the illegal trade of wildlife and forest products.

Tomar, on the other hand, has denied all allegations against him and has sought anticipatory bail from the court. In his bail application, Tomar argued that he has been falsely implicated in the case and that he has no connection with the illegal trade of wildlife and forest products. He further argued that he has cooperated with the investigating authorities and has provided all necessary information to them.

However, the court rejected Tomar's bail application, stating that the investigation is not yet over and custodial interrogation may be necessary. The court observed that the allegations against Tomar are serious in nature and that the investigation is at a crucial stage. The court further noted that if Tomar is granted bail at this stage, it may hamper the investigation and the prosecution's case.

The court's decision to reject Tomar's bail application is in line with the principles of criminal law. Anticipatory bail is granted to an accused person before arrest to enable him to approach the court for regular bail in case of arrest. However, the grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, including the requirement that the accused person cooperates with the investigating authorities and does not tamper with the evidence. In this case, the court found that Tomar's cooperation with the investigating authorities was not sufficient and that custodial interrogation may be necessary to further the investigation.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Tomar's bail application is a reminder that the grant of anticipatory bail is not a matter of right, but is subject to certain conditions. The court's decision also highlights the seriousness of the allegations against Tomar and the need for a thorough investigation into the matter. It remains to be seen how the case will progress and what the final outcome will be.
