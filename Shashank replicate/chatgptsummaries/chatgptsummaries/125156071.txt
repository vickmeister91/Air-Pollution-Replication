The Rajasthan High Court issued an order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10058/2009 on August 21, 2009. The petitioner had argued that the Member Secretary did not have the power to pass the order impugned on July 22, 2009, as only the Board is empowered under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court issued notice to the respondent and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders.

The case in question pertains to the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which was enacted to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. Section 31-A of the Act provides for the constitution of a National Air Quality Monitoring Committee and empowers the Central Pollution Control Board to take measures to prevent and control air pollution.

In the present case, the petitioner had challenged an order passed by the Member Secretary of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board on July 22, 2009. The petitioner had contended that the Member Secretary did not have the power to pass the order as only the Board is empowered under Section 31-A of the Act. The petitioner had also argued that the impugned order was arbitrary and violative of the principles of natural justice.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the petitioner, issued notice to the respondent and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders. The court observed that prima facie, it appeared that the Member Secretary did not have the power to pass the impugned order and that the same could only be passed by the Board. The court also noted that the petitioner had made out a prima facie case for grant of interim relief.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the principle that statutory authorities must act within the limits of their powers and that any action taken beyond the scope of their powers is liable to be struck down. The court's order also underscores the importance of the principles of natural justice and the need for authorities to act fairly and impartially.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10058/2009 is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. The court's order reaffirms the importance of the rule of law and the need for statutory authorities to act within the limits of their powers. The court's order also underscores the importance of the principles of natural justice and the need for authorities to act fairly and impartially.
