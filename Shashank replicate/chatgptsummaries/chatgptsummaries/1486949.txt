The Supreme Court of India recently heard a writ petition seeking the closure of various units of Shriram Foods & Fertilizers Industries on the grounds that they were hazardous to the community. During the pendency of the petition, there was an escape of oleum gas from one of the units of Shriram. The court referred the applications for compensation to a larger bench of five judges because issues of great constitutional importance were involved. The court held that the power of the court is not only injunctive in ambit but also remedial in scope and provides relief against a breach of the fundamental right already committed. The court also held that the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher laid down a principle of liability that if a person who brings on to his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do harm and such thing escapes and does damage to another, he is liable to compensate for the damage caused.

The court order discusses the evolution of liability laws in hazardous and dangerous industries in modern industrial societies. The court states that the law must evolve to keep up with the changing needs of society and cannot remain static. The court also discusses the duty of enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industries to ensure the highest standards of safety and compensate for any harm caused, regardless of negligence. The court also addresses the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.

The court order discusses the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the court under Article 32, which includes the power to protect fundamental rights and forge new remedies. The court can also award compensation in appropriate cases where there is a gross and patent infringement of fundamental rights. The availability of Article 21 against a private corporation engaged in an activity that has the potential to affect the life and health of the people is also discussed. The court concludes that Article 21 is available in such cases where the government has active control and regulation over the industry.

The court order discusses the criteria for determining whether a private corporation can be considered a state agency or instrumentality under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. The court cites previous cases and outlines five factors to consider, including financial assistance from the state, control of management and policies, and whether the corporation carries out public functions related to governmental functions. The court emphasizes the need to curb arbitrary and unregulated power and expand the scope of fundamental rights to include all authorities acting on behalf of the government. The court also clarifies that the manner in which a corporation is brought into existence is immaterial to the determination of whether it is a state instrumentality or agency.

The court order discusses whether a private corporation, such as Shriram, falls under the ambit of Article 12 and is subject to the discipline of Article 21. The court examines the Industrial Policy of the Government and the public interest importance given by the State to the activity carried on by such private corporations. The court finds that the activity of producing chemicals and fertilizers is deemed by the State to be an industry of vital public interest, whose public import necessitates that the activity should be ultimately carried out by the State itself. The court also examines the extensive control and supervision exercised by the government over Shriram's activities and finds that it is subject to various regulations and directions issued by the government. The court concludes that it is arguable that private corporations under the functional control of the State engaged in an activity which is hazardous to the health and safety of the community and is imbued with public interest should be subject to the same limitations as the State's power as an economic agent, economic entrepreneur, and allocator of economic benefits is subject to the limitations of fundamental rights. However, the court does not make any definite pronouncement on this question.

The court preferred the minority opinion in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company and Air India v. Nargesh Mirza, stating that American constitutional principles cannot always be applied to Indian conditions. The court expanded the scope of Article 12 to inject respect for human rights and social conscience in corporate structure. The court also evolved a new principle of liability for enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industries, holding them strictly and absolutely liable for any harm caused. The measure of compensation must be co-related to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise. The Delhi Legal Aid and Advice Board was directed to file actions on behalf of those who claim to have suffered on account of oleum gas escape.

The court has ordered the Delhi Legal Aid and Advice Board to file actions for compensation against Shriram within two months. The Delhi Administration is directed to provide necessary funds for this purpose. The High Court will nominate judges for the purpose of trying these actions. The issue of relocation and other matters will be heard on February 3, 1987. The petition has been disposed of.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India heard a writ petition seeking the closure of various units of Shriram Foods & Fertilizers Industries on the grounds that they were hazardous to the community. The court referred the applications for compensation to a larger bench of five judges because issues of great constitutional importance were involved.
