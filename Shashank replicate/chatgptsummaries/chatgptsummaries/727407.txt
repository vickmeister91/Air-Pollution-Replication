The court order pertains to a dispute between Smt. Moly Sunny and the Government of Kerala over the use of a forest road for quarrying operations. The petitioner had purchased a property that was originally forest land and had been assigned to an encroacher by the government. The petitioner had obtained a quarrying lease from the Mining and Geology Department, but the Forest Department had denied her permission to use the forest road for vehicular access to the quarry.

The court found that as long as the quarrying lease was current, the petitioner should be allowed to use the forest road for quarrying operations and directed the respondents to issue passes if necessary. The court also expressed concern over the dwindling forest wealth of the state and the need for all government departments to work together to protect it.

The court order allows the petitioner to use a road for quarrying operations on their land, with a limit of 10 passes. The respondents are not allowed to prevent the petitioner from using the forest road as long as the quarrying lease is valid. However, all quarrying operations in the forest land must be stopped as soon as possible, and the government of Kerala must take appropriate action within three months. Individual cancellation of permits and leases must follow principles of natural justice.
