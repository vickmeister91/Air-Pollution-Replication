The case in question involves a suit for recovery of money filed by The Andhra Bank Ltd against R. Srinivasan and others in the Hyderabad Court. During the pendency of the suit, one of the respondents died, and his legal representatives were joined in the suit. The Hyderabad Court decreed the suits, but the decretal money could not be realized in full. The appellant filed a suit for the balance in the Madras High Court based on the judgments of the Hyderabad Court. However, the respondents contended that the Hyderabad Court had no jurisdiction over them, and the foreign judgments of that Court were not binding on them.

The High Court held that under the rule of private international law, all personal actions must be filed in the courts of the country where the defendant resides, and as the legal representatives were non-residents of Hyderabad, the decrees passed against them were invalid. However, the Supreme Court held that the rule of private international law could not be applied to a case where the suit as initially filed was competent, and the court before which it was filed was competent to try it.

The court order states that the Hyderabad Court had no jurisdiction to try the claim against respondents 2 to 12 as they had not submitted to the court's jurisdiction. The rule of private international law on which the High Court relied is well settled, which states that a court cannot extend its process and exert sovereign power beyond its own territorial limits. The court also discusses exceptions to this rule, such as when a non-resident foreigner is a necessary or proper party to an action properly brought against someone else duly served with a writ in England.

The court concludes that the rule has to be applied at the commencement or initiation of the suit, and the two suits in the City Civil Court at Hyderabad were competent when they were brought. The claim made by the appellant against respondents 2 to 12 was in the nature of a personal claim, but in substance, the appellant would be entitled to execute its decree only against the assets of the deceased Raja Bahadur in the hands of respondents 2 to 12.

The court order pertains to a case where the legal representatives of a deceased person are non-resident foreigners. The court holds that the jurisdiction of the court continues unaffected in such cases, and the competence of the suit as originally filed remains unimpaired. The court also rejects the argument that the legal representatives in possession of the deceased's property under a will cannot be considered legal representatives under the law. The court cites previous judicial decisions to support the view that the term "legal representative" includes any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person.

The court order states that the term "legal representative" includes any person who represents the estate of a deceased judgment-debtor, not just administrators, executors, and heirs. The argument that a legatee who only obtains a part of the estate cannot be considered a legal representative is not accepted, as it would defeat the purpose of the definition. The court also cites a previous case where the Madras High Court's observation that legatees of part of the estate are not included in the definition of legal representative is deemed incorrect.

The court concludes that the foreign judgments in the case were pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction and that the respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased, so the appeal is allowed, and the decrees passed by the High Court are reversed.

In summary, the court order deals with a case where The Andhra Bank Ltd filed a suit for recovery of money against R. Srinivasan and others in the Hyderabad Court. The court held that the rule of private international law could not be applied to a case where the suit as initially filed was competent, and the court before which it was filed was competent to try it. The court also held that the jurisdiction of the court continues unaffected in cases where the legal representatives of a deceased person are non-resident foreigners. The court concluded that the foreign judgments in the case were pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction and that the respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased, so the appeal is allowed, and the decrees passed by the High Court are reversed.
