Three court orders have been summarized, all of which pertain to cases involving bank officials accused of fabricating documents and causing losses to their respective banks. In the first case, the State appealed against the acquittal of M.R. Natarajan and S. Xavier Moni, who were accused of fabricating documents and causing a loss of Rs. 6,22,282.48 to Bank of India. The prosecution argued that P.W.1, who granted sanction for prosecution, was a competent person to do so. However, the defense argued that P.W.1 did not have the power to grant sanction and that none of the original documents were filed before the court. The court ultimately held that P.W.1 did not have the power to grant sanction and that the documents produced by the prosecution were not original. Therefore, the accused were acquitted.

In the second case, the court order discusses the lack of proper evidence and procedure in a criminal case related to a foreign exchange transaction between Bank of India and Bank of America. The court found that the sanction given by P.W.1 was not in accordance with the law and that the prosecution failed to prove that the bank sustained any loss. The court also noted that the documents presented as evidence were not original and were not proved in accordance with the law. The court further discussed the evidence of various witnesses and found that there were inconsistencies and lack of proper documentation. Ultimately, the court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.

In the third case, two bank officials were accused of fabricating documents to show interbank transactions and causing a loss to their bank. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted them. The court also noted that vital documents were not produced, important witnesses were not examined, and there was no independent and impartial investigation by the investigating officer. The court confirmed the order of acquittal and dismissed the criminal appeal.

In all three cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The courts found that the evidence presented was not original and was not proved in accordance with the law. In addition, there were inconsistencies and lack of proper documentation in the evidence presented. The courts also noted that important witnesses were not examined and that there was no independent and impartial investigation by the investigating officer.

The lack of proper evidence and procedure in these cases highlights the importance of following due process and presenting original and properly proved evidence in court. It also emphasizes the need for independent and impartial investigations by investigating officers. Without these measures, the accused may be acquitted due to lack of evidence, even if they are guilty of the crime.
