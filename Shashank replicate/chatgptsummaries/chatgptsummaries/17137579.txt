The court orders provided cover a range of legal proceedings and decisions. One order pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondent to reduce the rate of advertisement in two dailies, Makkal Kural (Tamil) and Trinity Mirror (English), to Rs.13.49 per Sq.Cm. The petitioner argued that the rate of Rs.675/- per Sq.Cm. fixed by the respondent was exorbitant and unreasonable. The respondent argued that the rate of advertisement is fixed on the basis of market and that the Central Government advertisements are not normally published in regional newspapers with lesser circulation. The court did not provide a final decision on the matter.

Another court order contains several sections outlining various decisions and rulings. These include the percentage of ownership for certain properties, the allocation of funds, and the resolution of disputes. The order also includes dates and references to previous legal proceedings. However, without further context, it is difficult to provide a more specific summary.

Similarly, another court order contains a list of numbers and codes, as well as dates and descriptions of legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the specific details of the order without further context.

Another court order contains various financial transactions and amounts related to different individuals and entities. It also includes details about a legal case and the penalties imposed on the defendants. The order mentions the dates and amounts of payments to be made by the defendants. Additionally, it outlines the terms and conditions of the settlement and the consequences of non-compliance.

Another court order contains multiple sections with various percentages and dates. It appears to be related to legal proceedings and decisions regarding certain individuals or entities. Without more context, it is difficult to provide a more specific summary.

One court order discusses a petition against the government of Tamil Nadu for allegedly spending more money on advertising in two newspapers, Makkal Kural (Tamil) and Trinity Mirror (English), than in other regional newspapers. The court notes that the rates for advertising in different newspapers vary based on circulation and region, and that the two newspapers in question have accepted the rate set by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The court also notes that the petition does not include the other newspapers against whom relief is sought, and cites previous cases to emphasize the importance of including all necessary parties in a petition.

Another court order discusses the principles of natural justice and the distinction between necessary party, proper party, and proforma party. It also explains when a writ of Mandamus can be issued, stating that it must be shown that there is a non-discretionary legal duty upon the authority against whom relief is sought and that the person approaching the court has a legal right to be enforced. The court also emphasizes that a public interest litigation must have a genuine public interest involved and not be used for personal gain or political motives. The order ultimately denies the petitioner's request to reduce the rate of advertisement and dismisses the petition as motivated.

Another court order discusses the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and emphasizes the importance of ensuring that only those with genuine public interest and sufficient interest in the matter have the right to approach the court. The court warns against the abuse of PIL by those with personal gain or political motives and stresses the need for caution and circumspection in using PIL as a weapon for delivering social justice. The court also notes that frivolous and vexatious petitions waste valuable judicial time and should be dismissed with exemplary costs. The order provides guidelines for the court to determine the bona fides of the applicant and the gravity and seriousness of the information provided. The court also cautions against the misuse of PIL to delay legitimate administrative action or to gain a political objective.

Another court order emphasizes that public interest litigation should only be used to vindicate the fundamental rights of affected persons and not for personal grudges or enmity. The court must discourage such petitions and ensure that justice is not obstructed or polluted by unscrupulous litigants. The court should be careful in entertaining public interest litigations and reject applications of busybodies at the threshold itself. The court must strike a balance between two conflicting interests and act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public-spirited holy men. The court must filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique considerations. The court must be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest, an ugly private malice, vested interest, and/or publicity seeking is not lurking. Each case has to be examined on its own facts.

Finally, one court order states that even if a petitioner files a case for their own private interest, the court can investigate issues of public importance. This was demonstrated in a case where a medical officer filed a writ petition questioning the assessment of answer sheets for a medical exam, alleging malpractices by the Chief Minister of the state. The court held that an inquiry into the conduct of examiners of a premier university was a matter of public interest and necessary for the administration of justice. The court also emphasized the importance of a probono litigant showing efforts to obtain information and substantiate the cause for a bonafide public interest litigation. The writ petition in question was dismissed.

In summary, the court orders provided cover a range of legal proceedings and decisions, including petitions related to advertising rates, principles of natural justice
