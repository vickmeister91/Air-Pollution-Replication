The Kerala High Court recently dismissed two writ petitions, one filed by a citizen and the other by a crusher owners association, against a crusher unit owned by Afcon Infrastructure Ltd. The citizen alleged that the unit violated the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the conditions of its license, while the association argued that the unit should be stopped and action taken against it under section 26 of the Act. 

The court found that the unit had obtained various permits and licenses from statutory authorities and that if any conditions were violated, the Pollution Control Board had the power to stop operation of the unit and cancel its license. The court dismissed both petitions without prejudice to the right of the parties to approach the statutory authorities.

The case was brought to the court by a citizen who alleged that the crusher unit owned by Afcon Infrastructure Ltd. violated the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the conditions of its license. The citizen argued that the unit was causing pollution and that it should be stopped immediately. The crusher owners association also filed a writ petition against the unit, arguing that it should be stopped and action taken against it under section 26 of the Act.

The court found that the unit had obtained various permits and licenses from statutory authorities and that if any conditions were violated, the Pollution Control Board had the power to stop operation of the unit and cancel its license. The court also noted that the citizen and the association had not approached the Pollution Control Board with their grievances and that they had not exhausted their remedies under the Act.

The court dismissed both petitions without prejudice to the right of the parties to approach the statutory authorities. The court also noted that the Pollution Control Board had the power to take action against the unit if it was found to be violating the provisions of the Act or the conditions of its license.

While the crusher unit may have obtained all necessary permits and licenses, it is important to ensure that it is operating in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The case highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the regulatory process, as well as the need for greater public participation in decision-making processes that affect the environment.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the importance of following due process and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court.
