The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by P. Velusamy against K.V. Raghupathy. The petitioner had filed the petition to set aside an order passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Fast Track Court No.1, Egmore at Allikulam, Chennai, on 27.01.2016 in Crl.M.P.No.3434 of 2015 in C.C.No.585 of 2009. The petitioner had argued that the order was devoid of merits.

The case in question pertains to a loan of Rs. 3,00,000/- given by the petitioner to the accused in July 2007, which was not repaid, and a cheque issued by the accused for the same amount that was dishonoured. The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C calling for the complainant to produce three documents, including Income Tax returns for the year 2006-2007. The trial court had directed the complainant to produce the Income Tax returns, which the petitioner had challenged in the High Court.

The High Court allowed the petition and set aside the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the trial court had erred in directing the petitioner to produce the Income Tax returns. The court observed that the accused had not made out a case for the production of the Income Tax returns and that the trial court had not given any reasons for directing the petitioner to produce the same.

The court further observed that the accused had not shown how the Income Tax returns were relevant to the case. The court held that the production of the Income Tax returns would amount to a fishing expedition and that the trial court had erred in directing the petitioner to produce the same.

The court also observed that the accused had not made out a case for the production of the other two documents called for by him. The court held that the accused had not shown how the other two documents were relevant to the case and that the trial court had erred in directing the petitioner to produce the same.

The court held that the trial court had failed to appreciate the legal position and had acted arbitrarily in directing the petitioner to produce the Income Tax returns and the other two documents. The court observed that the trial court had not given any reasons for directing the petitioner to produce the documents and that the order passed by the trial court was devoid of merits.

In light of the above, the High Court allowed the petition and set aside the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the accused had not made out a case for the production of the Income Tax returns and the other two documents and that the trial court had erred in directing the petitioner to produce the same. The court observed that the trial court had failed to appreciate the legal position and had acted arbitrarily in directing the petitioner to produce the documents.
