The first court order pertains to a revision against the dismissal of an application for amendment of a written statement in a suit filed by the plaintiff against the defendants for permanent prohibitory injunction. The defendants claimed passage over a part of the plaintiff's land owned and possessed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contested the application, and the trial court dismissed it. The court discusses the power of the court to allow amendments and the importance of due diligence. The court ultimately upholds the trial court's decision to dismiss the application for amendment.

The court notes that the power to allow amendments is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously. The court also emphasizes the importance of due diligence in filing an application for amendment. The court observes that the plaintiff had filed the suit in 2012, and the application for amendment was filed in 2018, after the defendants had already filed their written statement. The court notes that the plaintiff had not given any explanation for the delay in filing the application for amendment.

The court also observes that the proposed amendment sought to introduce a new cause of action, which was not pleaded in the original suit. The court notes that the proposed amendment would have resulted in the defendants having to file a fresh written statement, which would have caused further delay in the proceedings. The court concludes that the trial court was justified in dismissing the application for amendment.

The second court order discusses the interpretation of a provision in the Code of Civil Procedure related to amending pleadings in a pending lawsuit. The court concludes that the provision should be given its plain and ordinary meaning, and that the amendment to the provision should be applied prospectively rather than retrospectively. The court also cites various rules of interpretation, including the importance of giving effect to the language of the statute and the need to consider the purpose and object of the legislation. The court ultimately denies the defendants' application to amend their pleading.

The third court order discusses various cases and principles of statutory interpretation. It emphasizes that the language of a statute should be given its natural and ordinary meaning, and that the Statement of Objects and Reasons of a Bill can be used to understand the background and antecedent state of affairs leading up to the legislation. The court also notes that the provisions of a statute should be interpreted strictly, particularly if they contain stringent provisions or provide heavier punishment. The order concludes by rejecting a plea to allow an amendment to pleadings, as the proviso to Order VI, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment), 2002, was added to curtail delay and expedite hearing of cases.
