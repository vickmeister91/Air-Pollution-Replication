The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing a complaint filed against the petitioners by the Punjab Pollution Control Board for violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners challenged the complaint on the grounds that they had provided all basic amenities and facilities before allotment of plots to buyers and that no condition was imposed upon them for installation of any effluent treatment plant.

The court found that the approval had been granted to the petitioners by respondent No.3, permitting them to join the sewerage lines of their colony in its sewerage line, and therefore, there was no necessity to install a sewerage treatment plant in compliance with the order dated 10.12.2008 of respondent No.1. The court ordered the complaint and summoning order to be quashed.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control water pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of effluent treatment plants, and makes it mandatory for certain industries to install such plants.

In this case, the petitioners had been accused of violating the Act by not installing an effluent treatment plant. However, the petitioners argued that they had provided all basic amenities and facilities before allotment of plots to buyers, and that no condition was imposed upon them for installation of any effluent treatment plant. The court found that the approval had been granted to the petitioners by respondent No.3, permitting them to join the sewerage lines of their colony in its sewerage line, and therefore, there was no necessity to install a sewerage treatment plant in compliance with the order dated 10.12.2008 of respondent No.1.

The court's decision to quash the complaint and summoning order is significant, as it highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant approvals and permissions are obtained before taking action against alleged violators of environmental laws. It also underscores the need for clarity and consistency in the application of environmental laws, and the importance of taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for environmental protection in India, as it reinforces the importance of ensuring that environmental laws are applied in a fair and consistent manner, and that all relevant approvals and permissions are obtained before taking action against alleged violators.
