The court order in question concerns the interpretation of Rule 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1978, which was framed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The case involves a company that claimed a rebate for installing a treatment plant for sewage or trade effluent, but the claim was denied or reduced. The court analyzed the Act and Rules and held that the emphasis on successful commissioning and functioning of the plant in Rule 6 is within the rule-making power of the government. The court also noted that the Act is skeletal in its form and relies on the Rules to provide details and flesh out the system.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 7 of the Cess Act and Rule 6 of the Rules. The court concludes that Section 7 cannot be interpreted to mean that any plant, regardless of its effectiveness, can earn a rebate. The purpose of the Cess Act is to levy a tax for a special administrative purpose, which is to augment the resources of the Central Board and the State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The court also notes that the Pollution Act and the Cess Act are intertwined and interlaced, and that the rules under the Cess Act must be understood in the context of the provisions of the Pollution Act. The court concludes that Rule 6 does not add to or amplify the scope and content of Section 7, and that the rule-making authority has not cut down the sweep of the section or added further conditions of its own. The court also notes that the rules have to be placed before the Parliament for approval, and that the Parliament has chosen to approve all these rules. The court rejects the argument that the existence of necessary sanctions under the Pollution Act inhibits the rule-making authority from framing a meaningful and purposive rule under the Cess Act. The court also rejects the argument that Rule 6 gives the Board the power to decide the success and effectiveness of the plant and places the will of the Parliament at the mercy of an outside agency.

The court order discusses the interpretation of a rule under the Cess Act and its connection to the Pollution Act. The court rejects the idea that the rule places the will of Parliament at the mercy of an outside agency, as the Board responsible for overseeing activities related to pollution is not an outside agency but rather carries out functions directed by Parliament. The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting water and the environment, citing international and national efforts to do so. The court allows the writ appeals and sets aside the judgment of the learned single Judge to the extent that Rule 6 has been read down, and directs the appellate authority to reconsider the case in light of their observations.

In summary, the court order concerns the interpretation of Rule 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1978, which was framed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977.
