Moolchand Patel, the applicant, filed an application for anticipatory bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C. for offences punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant was apprehending his arrest because a female Neel Gai was found dead due to a trap laid by the applicant in their agricultural field. The trial court had already rejected the bail application. After hearing the submissions and going through the case diary statements, the court rejected the application for anticipatory bail as no case was made out.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also provides for the establishment of protected areas, national parks, and sanctuaries for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Moolchand Patel was apprehending his arrest for offences punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant had laid a trap in their agricultural field, which resulted in the death of a female Neel Gai. The Neel Gai, also known as the blue bull, is the largest Asian antelope and is protected under the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act prohibits hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including the Neel Gai.

The trial court had already rejected the bail application of the applicant. The applicant then filed an application for anticipatory bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C. Section 438 of Cr.P.C. provides for the grant of anticipatory bail to a person apprehending arrest. The section empowers the court to grant anticipatory bail if it is satisfied that the person apprehending arrest has reason to believe that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offence.

After hearing the submissions and going through the case diary statements, the court rejected the application for anticipatory bail as no case was made out. The court observed that the applicant had laid a trap in their agricultural field, which resulted in the death of a female Neel Gai, a protected animal under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court further observed that the applicant had committed an offence punishable under the Act and that there was no ground to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant.

In conclusion, the court rejected the application for anticipatory bail filed by Moolchand Patel under section 438 of Cr.P.C. for offences punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court observed that the applicant had laid a trap in their agricultural field, which resulted in the death of a female Neel Gai, a protected animal under the Act. The court further observed that the applicant had committed an offence punishable under the Act and that there was no ground to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant.
