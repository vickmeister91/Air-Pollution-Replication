The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Kamlendra Singh under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. in relation to an offence under Section 9/51 of The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner's counsel argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner was involved in hunting a wild animal specified in the Act, and that mere possession of the hide of a cheetal did not constitute an offence. The court found that there was no evidence of hunting on record and granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on certain conditions. The court also criticized the investigating officer's conduct in creating evidence to constitute the offence under Section 9 of the Act.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, and provides for punishment for hunting, or attempting to hunt, any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, or IV of the Act. The punishment for such an offence can range from imprisonment for a term of three years to imprisonment for life, along with a fine.

In the present case, Kamlendra Singh had been accused of hunting a wild animal specified in the Act, and had been charged under Section 9/51 of the Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner was involved in hunting a wild animal specified in the Act, and that mere possession of the hide of a cheetal did not constitute an offence. The counsel further argued that the petitioner had been falsely implicated in the case, and that the investigating officer had created evidence to constitute the offence under Section 9 of the Act.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, found that there was no evidence of hunting on record. The court noted that the investigating officer had not been able to produce any evidence to suggest that the petitioner had hunted a wild animal specified in the Act. The court also observed that the mere possession of the hide of a cheetal did not constitute an offence under the Act. The court, therefore, granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on certain conditions.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner is significant, as it provides him with protection from arrest in the event that the investigating officer decides to file a charge sheet against him. Anticipatory bail is a provision under the Criminal Procedure Code that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. The grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the person being available for questioning by the investigating officer, and not leaving the country without the permission of the court.

The court's criticism of the investigating officer's conduct in creating evidence to constitute the offence under Section 9 of the Act is also significant. The court's observation highlights the need for investigating officers to conduct fair and impartial investigations, and to not resort to creating evidence to implicate an accused. The court's criticism of the investigating officer's conduct is likely to serve as a deterrent to other investigating officers who may be tempted to resort to such tactics.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Kamlendra Singh under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. in relation to an offence under Section 9/51 of The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found that there was no evidence of hunting on record, and granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on certain conditions. The court also criticized the investigating officer's conduct in creating evidence to constitute the offence under Section 9 of the Act. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner is significant, as it provides him with protection from arrest in the event that the investigating officer decides to file a charge sheet against him. The court's criticism of the investigating officer's conduct is also significant, as it highlights the need for investigating officers to conduct fair and impartial investigations.
