In the first court order, the case discussed is about a three-year-old boy who lost his arm in an incident at the National Zoological Park in Delhi. The boy's family filed a suit for damages against the zoo authorities, claiming negligence on their part for not properly confining the animals. The trial court found negligence on both sides and awarded an interim compensation of Rs. 40,000. However, the boy's family appealed the decision, arguing that the zoo authorities were solely responsible for the incident.

The court held that the zoo authorities had a duty to ensure the safety of visitors and that they were liable for the incident under the principles of tort law. The court also discussed the concept of strict liability for the keeper of dangerous animals and the duty of care owed by the occupier of the premises. The court found that the zoo authorities had failed to take adequate measures to prevent the incident from occurring, and therefore, they were solely responsible for the boy's injuries.
