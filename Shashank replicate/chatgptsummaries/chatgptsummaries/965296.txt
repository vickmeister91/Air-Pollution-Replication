In a recent case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, two accused persons, Joby and Shaji, were granted regular bail by the court. The accused were alleged to have trespassed into a reserve forest and hunted down a sambar deer. The court allowed their release on bail on the condition that they execute bonds for Rs.50,000 each with two solvent sureties and make themselves available for interrogation before the investigating officer on all Mondays and Fridays for a period of two months.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 with the objective of protecting wild animals and plants and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife. It also prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

In the present case, the accused were alleged to have violated the provisions of the Act by trespassing into a reserve forest and hunting down a sambar deer. The sambar deer is a protected species under the Act and hunting it is a punishable offense. The accused were arrested by the forest department officials and produced before the court.

The accused applied for bail on the grounds that they were falsely implicated in the case and that they had no criminal antecedents. The prosecution opposed the bail application on the grounds that the accused were habitual offenders and that they were likely to abscond if released on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court granted bail to the accused on the condition that they execute bonds for Rs.50,000 each with two solvent sureties. The court also directed the accused to make themselves available for interrogation before the investigating officer on all Mondays and Fridays for a period of two months.

The condition of executing bonds with solvent sureties is a common condition imposed by courts while granting bail. The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the accused does not abscond and appears before the court as and when required. The sureties are required to furnish an undertaking that they will produce the accused before the court whenever required.

The condition of making oneself available for interrogation before the investigating officer is also a common condition imposed by courts while granting bail. The purpose of this condition is to enable the investigating officer to complete the investigation and gather evidence against the accused. The accused is required to cooperate with the investigating officer and provide all necessary information.

In conclusion, the court granted regular bail to two accused persons, Joby and Shaji, in a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The accused were alleged to have trespassed into a reserve forest and hunted down a sambar deer. The court allowed their release on bail on the condition that they execute bonds for Rs.50,000 each with two solvent sureties and make themselves available for interrogation before the investigating officer on all Mondays and Fridays for a period of two months. These conditions are commonly imposed by courts while granting bail to ensure that the accused does not abscond and cooperates with the investigation.
