The Madras High Court recently heard a petition filed by M.P. Velraja and V. Sumathi, who sought a direction to the police not to harass them under the guise of an enquiry. The police had sent summons to the couple's daughter and her husband under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The government advocate argued that the police were bound to investigate complaints and that they had no power to harass individuals. The court disposed of the petition, recording the government advocate's submission that the enquiry would be conducted strictly in accordance with the law and the petitioners would not be harassed.

The petitioners had approached the court seeking relief from the police's alleged harassment. The police had sent summons to the couple's daughter and her husband under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which allows the police to issue a notice to any person to produce any document or thing that may be necessary for an investigation. The petitioners claimed that the police were harassing them under the guise of an enquiry and that they were being targeted due to their political affiliations.

The government advocate argued that the police were bound to investigate complaints and that they had no power to harass individuals. The advocate further submitted that the police were conducting the enquiry strictly in accordance with the law and that the petitioners would not be harassed. The court disposed of the petition, recording the government advocate's submission.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the police are bound to investigate complaints and that they have no power to harass individuals. The court's decision also highlights the importance of conducting investigations strictly in accordance with the law and ensuring that individuals are not harassed or targeted due to their political affiliations.

The use of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. has been a contentious issue in recent times, with many individuals alleging that the police are misusing the provision to harass and target individuals. The provision allows the police to issue a notice to any person to produce any document or thing that may be necessary for an investigation. However, the provision has been misused in the past, with the police using it to harass and target individuals.

The court's decision is a welcome step towards ensuring that the police do not misuse their powers and that investigations are conducted strictly in accordance with the law. The court's decision also sends a strong message to the police that they cannot harass or target individuals under the guise of an enquiry.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in the petition filed by M.P. Velraja and V. Sumathi reaffirms the principle that the police are bound to investigate complaints and that they have no power to harass individuals. The court's decision also highlights the importance of conducting investigations strictly in accordance with the law and ensuring that individuals are not harassed or targeted due to their political affiliations. The court's decision is a welcome step towards ensuring that the police do not misuse their powers and that investigations are conducted in a fair and just manner.
