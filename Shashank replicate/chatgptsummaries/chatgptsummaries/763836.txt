The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in a writ petition filed by A. Saravanan against the Chief Engineer/Personnel and the Superintending Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. Saravanan, who was appointed as a Technical Assistant/Electrical in the Board, was later informed that he was wrongly selected under the reserved quota for SC/ST candidates and his provisional selection was cancelled. Saravanan argued that he was selected only under the BC quota and that there were several vacancies in the same post. He sought a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the memo cancelling his appointment and to direct the respondents to continue to employ him in service. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order states that the principles of natural justice cannot be put in a strict formula and that in some cases, the audi alteram partem rule (the right to be heard) may not apply. The court also notes that the issuance of a show cause notice may be a useless formality in cases where the outcome is already predetermined. The case in question involves the termination of an employee who was mistakenly appointed under the wrong quota. The court finds that the employee was not entitled to any relief and dismisses the writ petition.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of natural justice in employment matters. The court notes that the right to be heard is a fundamental principle of natural justice and that it must be followed in all cases. However, the court also recognizes that there may be situations where the audi alteram partem rule may not apply. In such cases, the court must consider the facts of the case and determine whether the rule is necessary.

In the case of Saravanan, the court found that the employee was not entitled to any relief as he was mistakenly appointed under the wrong quota. The court notes that the employee was not entitled to the post as he did not meet the eligibility criteria for the reserved quota. The court also notes that there were several vacancies in the same post under the BC quota, which the employee was eligible for. Therefore, the court finds that the employee was not entitled to any relief and dismisses the writ petition.

The court order also highlights the importance of following due process in employment matters. The court notes that the issuance of a show cause notice may be a useless formality in cases where the outcome is already predetermined. However, the court also notes that due process must be followed in all cases to ensure that the rights of the employee are protected. Therefore, the court emphasizes the importance of following due process in all employment matters.

In conclusion, the court order in the writ petition filed by A. Saravanan highlights the importance of natural justice and due process in employment matters. The court notes that the right to be heard is a fundamental principle of natural justice and that it must be followed in all cases. However, the court also recognizes that there may be situations where the audi alteram partem rule may not apply. The court also emphasizes the importance of following due process in all employment matters to ensure that the rights of the employee are protected.
