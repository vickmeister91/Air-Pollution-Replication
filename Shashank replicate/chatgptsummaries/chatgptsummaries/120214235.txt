The recent court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Automobile Ancillary Industries against the Central Pollution Control Board and others. The petitioner claimed that it was exempted from obtaining annual renewals under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976, as it was a small-scale industry and did not discharge any water or sewage. However, the respondent argued that the petitioner was required to submit returns and renew consent periodically.

The court heard both sides and directed the petitioner to approach the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board with all supporting facts and documents within 15 days. The court disposed of the writ petition accordingly.

The case highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining necessary approvals and renewals. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976, require industries to obtain consent from the State Pollution Control Board before establishing or operating any industrial plant or process. The consent is granted based on various factors such as the nature of the industry, the type and quantity of pollutants generated, and the location of the industry.

The consent is valid for a specific period, and industries are required to renew it periodically. The renewal process involves submitting returns and documents to the State Pollution Control Board, demonstrating compliance with environmental regulations and standards. Failure to obtain or renew consent can result in legal action, including fines and closure of the industry.
