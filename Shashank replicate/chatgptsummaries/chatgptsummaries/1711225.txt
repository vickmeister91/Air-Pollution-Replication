In a recent case, the petitioners filed a writ petition seeking protection from dispossession of their land and a restraint on the respondents from intervening in their peaceful possession. The petitioners claimed to be Bhumidhar with Transferable right over the land in question, while the respondents claimed that the land was declared as forest reserved land in 1974. 

The court observed that the disputed question of facts could only be decided by evidence and that the petitioners should file a suit to get their rights adjudicated under the Indian Forest Act. The court further noted that the writ jurisdiction should not be used as a substitute for the regular legal remedies available to the parties. 

The court relied on the principle that writ jurisdiction is discretionary and should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases where there is a violation of a fundamental right or a legal right. The court also noted that the writ jurisdiction cannot be used to decide disputed questions of fact, which are better left to be decided by a regular court of law.

The court further observed that the Indian Forest Act provides for a mechanism for adjudication of rights over forest land and that the petitioners should avail of this remedy. The court noted that the Indian Forest Act provides for the constitution of Forest Settlement Officers who are empowered to decide disputes relating to forest land. 

The court also noted that the Indian Forest Act provides for an appeal mechanism against the decision of the Forest Settlement Officer and that the petitioners could avail of this remedy if they were aggrieved by the decision of the Forest Settlement Officer. 

The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition and directed the petitioners to avail of the remedies available to them under the Indian Forest Act. The court also observed that the respondents should not interfere with the peaceful possession of the petitioners until their rights were adjudicated under the Indian Forest Act.

In conclusion, the court emphasized the importance of following the regular legal remedies available to the parties and not using the writ jurisdiction as a substitute for the same. The court also highlighted the importance of the Indian Forest Act in adjudicating disputes relating to forest land and urged the parties to avail of the remedies available under the Act.
