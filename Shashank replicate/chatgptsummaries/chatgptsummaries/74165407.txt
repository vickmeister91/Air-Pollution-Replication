The court order pertains to an application for eviction of a tenant on the grounds of non-payment of rent. The landlady and her joint owner claimed that the tenant had not paid rent or electricity charges since April 2009, despite repeated requests and demands. The tenant failed to file a written statement of defense, and her defense was struck out. The landlady provided evidence of the tenant's non-payment of rent and a false reply to a legal notice. The court allowed the application for recovery of possession of the premises and ordered the tenant to pay or deposit legally recoverable arrears of rent within one month. If the tenant complies with the order, she will not be evicted.

The case at hand highlights the importance of timely payment of rent and adherence to legal procedures. The landlady and her joint owner had repeatedly requested the tenant to pay rent and electricity charges, but to no avail. The tenant's failure to file a written statement of defense further weakened her case. The landlady, on the other hand, provided evidence of the tenant's non-payment of rent and a false reply to a legal notice, which strengthened her case.

The court's decision to allow the application for recovery of possession of the premises and order the tenant to pay or deposit legally recoverable arrears of rent within one month is in line with legal procedures. The court's decision also takes into account the tenant's right to not be evicted if she complies with the order. This decision serves as a reminder to tenants to pay rent on time and to landlords to follow legal procedures when dealing with non-payment of rent.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of evidence in legal proceedings. The landlady's evidence of the tenant's non-payment of rent and false reply to a legal notice played a crucial role in the court's decision. This emphasizes the need for parties to provide evidence to support their claims in legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order regarding the application for eviction of a tenant on the grounds of non-payment of rent serves as a reminder to tenants to pay rent on time and to landlords to follow legal procedures when dealing with non-payment of rent. The court's decision to allow the application for recovery of possession of the premises and order the tenant to pay or deposit legally recoverable arrears of rent within one month is in line with legal procedures and takes into account the tenant's right to not be evicted if she complies with the order.
