The court order in question pertains to an application filed by Md. Naseem, who sought the quashing of a complaint case against him for offences punishable under the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act. The case was instituted against him for excavating a piece of land lying within the forest area and converting it to stone. The petitioner had entered into an agreement of lease with the Collector, Munger, and had been granted a mining lease. However, the petitioner had stopped his mining operations after the renewal of his mining lease was rejected.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the application and quashed the complaint case. The court observed that the petitioner had obtained the lease for mining operations from the Collector, Munger, and had been carrying out the mining operations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease. The court further observed that the petitioner had stopped his mining operations after the renewal of his mining lease was rejected, and therefore, he could not be held liable for any offence under the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act.

The court also noted that the petitioner had obtained the lease for mining operations after obtaining the necessary clearances from the concerned authorities. The court observed that the petitioner had obtained the necessary clearances from the Forest Department and the Pollution Control Board, and therefore, he could not be held liable for any offence under the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act.

The court further observed that the complaint case against the petitioner was filed by the Forest Department after the renewal of his mining lease was rejected. The court noted that the Forest Department had not taken any action against the petitioner during the period when he was carrying out the mining operations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease. The court observed that the complaint case against the petitioner was filed with the intention of harassing him and therefore, the court quashed the complaint case.
