The court order pertains to a series of appeals against an order that dismissed writ petitions challenging eviction orders passed against the appellants under the Punjab Public Premises and Land (Eviction & Rent Recovery) Act, 1973. The case involves the transfer of ownership of land from a landlord to the State Government towards settlement of a loan, with certain exclusions. The appellant's case is that the land was declared "Second Class Forests" under the Patiala Forest Act, and the government issued a notification prohibiting cutting, felling or lopping of trees and grazing of cattle on the land. The court order summarizes the facts of the case and the relevant notifications issued by the government.

The court found that the land in question belonged to the Forest Department of Punjab State and the appellants were illegal occupants. The receipts produced by the appellants claiming to be lessees were not reliable as they were obtained after eviction proceedings had begun. The revenue record shows that the appellants were in illegal possession of the land without paying rent. The court strongly disapproved of the practice of the State Government selling land to encroachers instead of vacating it and disposing of it transparently through auction. The subject-land cannot be sold or used for non-forestry purposes and must be maintained and utilized for forest or allied purposes only, in accordance with the Forest Conservation Act of 1980. The land may be auctioned in a transparent manner if necessary. The appeals related to this matter have been dismissed.
