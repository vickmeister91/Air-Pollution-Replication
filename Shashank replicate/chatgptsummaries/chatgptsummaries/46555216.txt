The court order pertains to a writ petition challenging notifications issued by the State Government of Maharashtra regarding the construction of a car-shed depot for the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation. The petitioners are seeking to prevent the destruction of trees in Aarey Milk Colony and harm to the environment. The court is considering whether the notifications result in the destruction of green cover and whether the construction of the car-shed is permissible in the area. The order provides background information on the project and events leading up to the petition.

The controversy surrounding the proposed cutting of trees at Aarey Depot in Mumbai for the construction of a metro car depot is discussed in the court order. The court notes that a Technical Committee recommended relocating the car depot to Kanjur Marg to prevent harm to the environment, but the government approved the construction at Aarey Depot. The petitioners argue that Aarey Depot is a pristine area of land with dense tree cover and is a natural habitat for various species of birds and animals. They also claim that there is no justification for the requirement of 33 hectares of land for the Metro 3 Car Depot at Aarey and that any other less ecologically damaging location would suffice. The court order provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the controversy and the objections raised by concerned citizens and residents.

A petition filed against the construction of a metro car-shed in Mumbai's Aarey Milk Colony, which is claimed to be a fragile eco-system that needs to be preserved, is also discussed in the court order. The petitioners refer to reports that highlight the impact of unplanned urbanization and deteriorating environment on flooding in the city. The respondents argue that the land at Aarey is necessary for the project and that alternate sites were considered. The petitioners claim that the land at Aarey is in an eco-sensitive forest area and filling it up would cause ecological destruction. The court has yet to make a decision.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the use of land in Aarey and Kanjur Marg for a metro car-shed. The petitioners argue that using the land in Aarey, which is an eco-sensitive forest area and flood plain for the Mithi River, would cause ecological destruction. The respondents argue that the land in Kanjur Marg is more suitable for the car-shed and that all necessary steps have been taken to mitigate environmental impact. The court examines the legal procedures followed and the conditions imposed on the use of the land in Aarey, and ultimately rules in favor of the respondents.

An additional affidavit filed by the State regarding the proposed construction of a metro car depot in the Aarey Milk Colony is also discussed in the court order. The affidavit claims that the land in question is not recognized as forest land and has been proposed for inclusion in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The affidavit also states that the decision to construct the depot on this land was taken after detailed deliberation and consultations. The affidavit further addresses concerns about the impact on trees and states that compensatory tree plantation will be undertaken. The affidavit also explains the need for the depot and its location, which will serve as an important multi-modal interchange point.

The court order discusses the consideration of various options for the construction of a car depot in Mumbai and the steps taken to minimize environmental damage. The petitioners argue that the chosen location, Aarey Milk Colony, is a critical flood plain and should be rejected in favor of an alternate plot. The court hears arguments from both sides, with the petitioners arguing for the protection and preservation of the environment, and ultimately decides to continue the case.

A petition against a notification that changes the character of the Development Plan-1991 in respect of the Aarey land from the No-Development Zone to Metro Car Depot/Workshop, allied facilities and Commercial (C-1) Zone is also discussed in the court order. The court emphasizes the need to balance the needs of modernizing public transport with protecting the environment and ecology. The court also notes that the State has an obligation to protect forests, natural resources, lakes, and open spaces for the use and enjoyment of the public. The court finds that the notification is contrary to law and should be quashed and set aside. The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting urban forests and complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court order discusses the argument that Aarey Milk Colony is a forest and therefore no development is permitted in it. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 restricts the de-reservation of forest or use of forest land for non-forest purposes, and the Aarey Milk Colony is considered a forested area. The court also notes that the metro car depot project in the Aarey land was carried out without prior permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and is therefore illegal. The Municipal Corporation had made modifications to the Draft Development Plan for the property in issue, including the land proposed to be reserved for the metro/mono car-shed being included in the Green Zone.

The court order discusses the modification made by the Municipal Corporation to include land proposed for a metro/mono car-shed in the Green Zone. The Draft Development Plan was submitted to the State Government for sanction and was approved on November 9, 2017. The court is asked to dismiss the writ petition challenging the notification as
