The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to cases involving the import and export of hazardous wastes, specifically used rubber tires, for the purpose of manufacturing carbon black and other products. The first court order involves Royal Carbon Black (P) Limited, which claims to have the necessary permissions and licenses for the import of used rubber tires with one cut. However, the Chief Commissioner of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs (Import) at JNPT Port have created obstacles in the import of both sets of goods on the ground that the Petitioners do not have permission or a license required for goods falling under entry B-3140 of Part B of Schedule III of the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2008. The court is hearing the case and considering the relief sought by the Petitioners.

The second court order discusses a case where the Petitioners are raising academic issues to avoid the required tests for hazardous cargo under the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2008. The Petitioners import two types of items, one of which is freely importable while the other requires a license from the Director General of Foreign Trade. Waste pneumatic tires fall under the restricted category and can only be imported with permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court examines the provisions of the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2008 and concludes that the import and export of hazardous wastes specified in Schedule III shall be regulated.

The third court order prohibits the export of hazardous wastes listed in Schedule VI and regulates the import and export of hazardous wastes listed in Schedule III. The import of hazardous wastes requires prior informed consent from the exporting country, a license from the Director General of Foreign Trade, and written permission from the Central Government. The Ministry of Environment and Forests must examine the application and grant permission within 60 days if the importer has environmentally sound recycling facilities, adequate waste treatment and disposal facilities, and a valid registration from the Central Pollution Control Board. The Port and Customs authorities must ensure compliance with import conditions and safe handling of hazardous waste. The import of used rubber tires with one cut in bead wire falls under the Open General License, while shredded tires are a restricted item requiring a license from the Director General of Foreign Trade.

The fourth court order pertains to a petition for the import of tyre scrap for the manufacture of bio-fuel oils and carbon black subject to the terms of the license. The court clarifies that no further directions are necessary and that the customs authorities must inspect and examine any consignment upon arrival. The petitioners seek a direction that the consignment should be cleared by following clause 3 of the public notice dated 21 April 2009, but the court dismisses this request. The court emphasizes that the import, management, and handling of hazardous wastes must not result in a deleterious effect on public health and the environment and that the provisions contained in the rules must be scrupulously enforced. The court dismisses the petition and there shall be no order as to costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of regulating the import and export of hazardous wastes to ensure the protection of public health and the environment. The court emphasizes the need for compliance with import conditions and safe handling of hazardous waste, and the importance of enforcing the provisions contained in the rules. The court orders also clarify the requirements for obtaining permission and licenses for the import and export of hazardous wastes, and the need for inspections and examinations of consignments upon arrival.
