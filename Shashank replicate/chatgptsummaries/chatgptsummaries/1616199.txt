The Delhi High Court recently heard writ petitions arising from judgments of the Central Administrative Tribunal regarding the regularization of Group 'C' employees in the Central Pollution Control Board. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, provides for the constitution of the Board and the conditions of service of its employees. The Board proposed a Casual employees (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme, which was not given effect to, and the Original Applicants approached the Tribunal for regularization and equal pay for equal work. The Tribunal gave conflicting judgments, and the writ petitions were filed questioning them.

The Court held that the scheme could not be given effect to without the approval of the Central Government, and services of an employee cannot be directed to be regularized in the absence of any statute or statutory rules. The Court also observed that the scheme proposed by the Board was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The Court further held that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to direct the regularization of the services of the petitioners, as the same could only be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder.

The Court also observed that the financial constraints cannot be a ground for denying the just benefit to its employees by the Board nor can it be used as a shield for non-payment of the just dues of the petitioners. The petitioners were held to be entitled to the benefit of the scale of pay granted from 3rd October 1996.

In another case, the Supreme Court dismissed a court order regarding the regularization of services for certain employees, stating that no binding precedent was created and no enforceable right was accrued to the concerned employees. The court found that the learned Tribunal could not have issued any direction for regularization of the services of the petitioners. The matter is pending consideration before the Central Government.

The Court also observed that financial constraints cannot be a ground for denying the just benefit to its employees by the Board nor can it be used as a shield for non-payment of the just dues of the petitioners. The petitioners were held to be entitled to the benefit of the scale of pay granted from 3rd October 1996.

The Court held that the scheme could not be given effect to without the approval of the Central Government, and services of an employee cannot be directed to be regularized in the absence of any statute or statutory rules. The Court also observed that the scheme proposed by the Board was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The Court further held that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to direct the regularization of the services of the petitioners, as the same could only be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court have both dealt with cases related to the regularization of services for certain employees in the Central Pollution Control Board. While the Delhi High Court held that the scheme proposed by the Board was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder, and that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to direct the regularization of the services of the petitioners, the Supreme Court dismissed a court order regarding the regularization of services for certain employees, stating that no binding precedent was created and no enforceable right was accrued to the concerned employees. The matter is pending consideration before the Central Government. However, both courts have observed that financial constraints cannot be a ground for denying the just benefit to its employees by the Board nor can it be used as a shield for non-payment of the just dues of the petitioners. The petitioners were held to be entitled to the benefit of the scale of pay granted from 3rd October 1996.
