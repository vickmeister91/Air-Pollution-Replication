The court orders in question pertain to disputes over property ownership and possession. In the first case, Smt. Ameeda filed an appeal against an order to vacate a property issued by the Head Quarters Assistant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bangalore Urban. Ameeda claimed to be the absolute owner of the property and had been in possession of it since 1973. She had also filed suits against the Corporation authorities and the State of Karnataka for injunctions. However, the respondent claimed that Ameeda was an unauthorized occupant and presented evidence to support their claim. After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the court upheld the order to vacate the property, ruling in favor of the respondent.

In the second case, the appellant claimed to be the owner of a property and had been in possession for 33 years. However, the corporation authority took control over the maintenance in 1991 and disturbed her possession. She filed a suit against the State of Karnataka, which is still pending. The second respondent filed a case claiming that the appellant was an unauthorized occupant, and the first respondent passed an order directing her to vacate the premises. The appellant challenged the order, stating that she was in peaceful possession and produced documents to support her claim. The respondent claimed that the Hakkupatra produced by the appellant was a created document and that she was an unauthorized occupant. The court found that the Hakkupatra was a created document and that the appellant was an unauthorized occupant. The court referred to Section 5 of The Karnataka Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1974, which allows for eviction of unauthorized occupants. The court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order for eviction.

In the third case, the court order stated that an officer authorized by a competent officer could evict a person from public premises and use necessary force. The order referred to several legal decisions and concluded that the impugned order passed by the respondent No.1 was illegal and perverse. The matter was remanded to the respondent No.1 for fresh disposal in accordance with the law. The appellant was directed to appear before the competent authority on 21/11/2016 without waiting for notice. There was no order as to costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of proper documentation and evidence in property ownership and possession disputes. In the first case, despite Ameeda's claims of ownership and previous legal action, the respondent was able to present evidence that ultimately led to the court ruling in their favor. Similarly, in the second case, the appellant's produced document was found to be fraudulent, leading to the court upholding the order for eviction. In the third case, the court emphasized the need for proper legal procedures to be followed in eviction cases and remanded the matter for fresh disposal in accordance with the law. These cases serve as a reminder to individuals to ensure that they have proper documentation and evidence to support their claims in property disputes.
