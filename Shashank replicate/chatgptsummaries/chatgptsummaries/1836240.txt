The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case where petitioners sought a writ in the nature of mandamus to prevent the respondents from interfering with their right to excavate, remove, and transport granite found in their patta land/s. The respondents disputed the petitioners' right to extract minor minerals except in accordance with the rules framed under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. 

The court considered the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder and concluded that the petitioners had no right to quarry either black granite or pink granite in areas coming under Kollegal, Kanakaputa, Tumkur, Bellary, Bijapur, and other places, save as otherwise provided in the rules. The court also noted that the quarrying operations attract the provisions of the Explosives Act and in violation of the provisions of the Explosive Act, many petitioners had indulged in unauthorized quarrying. 

The court considered the relevant rules framed by the State of Karnataka in exercise of powers conferred under Section 15 of the Act and concluded that the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder did not confer any right on the petitioners to quarry precious stones. The court order refers to previous cases where the issue of mineral rights has been addressed and granted to the petitioners. 

However, the government argues that the regulation and development of mines and minerals fall under the control of the Union and any state laws are extinguished. The court cites previous Supreme Court decisions that state that once Parliament declares that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the Union, the state legislature loses its power to legislate on the topic. 

The court also notes that the winning of minor minerals was enjoyed by virtue of exemption given under proviso to S. 38 of the Mysore Land Revenue Code and Board Standing Orders of the erstwhile State of Madras. In another case, the petitioners claimed to be the absolute owners of minerals found in their land and argued that the state government had no right over them. 

The court found that the right to mines and mineral products vests in the government, subject to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. The court also stated that the proviso to Section 38 of the Land Revenue Code, which exempted certain minerals from government control, was no longer valid after the enactment of the Mines and Minerals Act. 

The court held that the new law covered the field and any rights derived under the old law would have to be determined with reference to the new law. The court also discussed the application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which states that a repeal of an enactment does not affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under the repealed enactment, unless a different intention appears from the new enactment. 

In another case, the court discussed the interpretation of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 and the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1969. The court concluded that the Act and Rules do not preserve any right accrued or derived under the State law, and that the right derived under proviso to S. 38 of the Code and Madras Board Standing Order, if any, are incompatible with the provisions of the Act. 

The court also notes that the Rules intend to achieve the object embodied in Ss. 4, 16 and 19 of the Act, and that the acquisition of rights in or over minerals in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules shall be void and ineffective. The court dismisses the writ petitions and discharges the rule. 

The court order states that any action taken must follow the Act and Rules to avoid inconsistencies. The writ petitions have been dismissed and the rule has been discharged. In summary, the court has held that the right to mines and mineral products vests in the government, subject to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. The court has also noted that any rights derived under old laws would have to be determined with reference to the new law. 

The court has dismissed writ petitions seeking to prevent interference with the petitioners' right to excavate, remove, and transport granite found in their patta land/s. The court has also concluded that the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder did not confer any right on the petitioners to quarry precious stones. Any acquisition of rights in or over minerals in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules shall be void and ineffective.
