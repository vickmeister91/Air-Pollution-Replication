In September 2012, the Bombay High Court heard a petition filed by Jigish Shah and two others seeking to quash an FIR under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles 14, 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners argued that the FIR was unjustified and that they had obtained all necessary clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act.

The court heard arguments from both sides and decided that the matter required further consideration, given the contentions raised about liability under the Environment (Protection) Act and the clearance obtained. The court ordered the matter to be returned in the last week of September 2012 and granted interim relief until the final hearing and disposal of the petition.

The case revolves around allegations of environmental damage caused by the construction of a residential complex in Mumbai. The petitioners argue that they had obtained all necessary clearances and that the allegations are baseless. However, the complainant alleges that the construction has caused damage to the environment and that the necessary clearances were not obtained.

The court's decision to grant interim relief until the final hearing and disposal of the petition is significant as it allows the petitioners to continue with the construction of the residential complex without fear of legal action. However, the court's decision to order the matter to be returned in the last week of September 2012 indicates that the court is not yet satisfied with the arguments presented by both sides and requires further consideration.

The court's decision to grant interim relief is based on the principle of balance of convenience. The court considered the potential harm that could be caused to the petitioners if the construction was halted, as well as the potential harm that could be caused to the environment if the construction continued. The court ultimately decided that the harm caused to the petitioners would be greater than the harm caused to the environment if interim relief was not granted.

The court's decision to order the matter to be returned in the last week of September 2012 indicates that the court is not yet satisfied with the arguments presented by both sides. The court may require further evidence or clarification before making a final decision on the matter.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's decision to grant interim relief to Jigish Shah and two others in their petition to quash an FIR under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles 14, 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India is significant as it allows the petitioners to continue with the construction of a residential complex without fear of legal action. However, the court's decision to order the matter to be returned in the last week of September 2012 indicates that the court is not yet satisfied with the arguments presented by both sides and requires further consideration. The case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act and the potential legal consequences of failing to do so.
