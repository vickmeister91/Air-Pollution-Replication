The case in question involved a petition filed under Section 482Cr.P.C. by the petitioner, who sought to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate Karauli, District Karauli. The order in question had refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner, which were case property of FIR No.14/2019 registered at Police Station Mandrayal, Karauli. The vehicles had been seized in connection with offences under Section 379 IPC, Sections 29, 50 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The petitioner's petition was successful, and the court directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property. However, certain conditions were imposed on the release of the vehicles. The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit.

The decision to release the vehicles was based on the fact that they were not directly involved in the commission of the offences in question. The court noted that the tractor and trolley were merely used to transport the stolen goods, and were not themselves the subject of the offences. As such, the court found that there was no reason to continue to hold the vehicles as case property.

However, the court also recognized the need to ensure that the vehicles were not used for any illegal activities in the future. To this end, the court imposed certain conditions on the release of the vehicles. These conditions included the requirement that the petitioner and sureties furnish a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds, and that the trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions it deemed fit.

Overall, the court's decision in this case reflects a careful balancing of the need to ensure that justice is served in relation to the offences in question, while also recognizing the rights of the petitioner and the need to prevent any further illegal activities. By imposing certain conditions on the release of the vehicles, the court was able to achieve this balance and ensure that justice was served in a fair and equitable manner.
