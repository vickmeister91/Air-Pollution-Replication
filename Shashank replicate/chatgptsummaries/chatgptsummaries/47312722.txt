The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by the legal heirs of V. Krishnasamy Mudaliar, seeking the renewal of a lease of land measuring about 28.83.5 hectares equivalent to 71.22 acres in Minjur and Vallur villages in Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu. The lease was granted for a period of 99 years in 1905, and it expired in 2004. The petitioners argued that they had a vested right to claim renewal of the lease, but the court held that the lease had lapsed on expiry of the time limit specified in the lease agreement and that the petitioners did not have a vested right to claim renewal.

The court also noted that the lands were required for multipurpose government public schemes and had already been handed over to Chennai Corporation for the purpose of solid waste management and composite yard. The court observed that the government had the power to resume the lands for public purposes and that the petitioners' claim for renewal of the lease could not be accepted. The court held that the lands were required for public purposes and that the government had taken the decision to resume the lands for such public purpose. The court found that there was no arbitrariness nor was it a colourable exercise of power.

The court order states that the petitioner's claim for lease of government land cannot be accepted as no person has a vested right to get any lease of government land. The lands were resumed for public purpose and the state government had taken the decision to resume the lands for such public purpose. The petitioner's submission is negatived as there is no arbitrariness nor is it a colourable exercise of power. The writ petitions stand dismissed.
