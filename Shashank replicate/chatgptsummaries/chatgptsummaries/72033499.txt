The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to bring to the notice of the court the discrepancies in the claim of the complainant. However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call the Income Tax records of the complainant at this stage.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the dishonour of cheques.

In this case, Delhi Finance Company had filed a complaint against Resham Suri under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The complainant had then sent a legal notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount due, but the accused had failed to make the payment. Hence, the complainant had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. The accused had claimed that there were discrepancies in the claim of the complainant and that the Income Tax Returns would bring these discrepancies to the notice of the court. However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call the Income Tax records of the complainant at this stage.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) deals with the power of the court to issue summons for the production of documents or other things. It states that any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C, summon any person as a witness or order any person to produce any document or other thing which is in his possession or under his control.

In this case, the accused had invoked Section 91 Cr.P.C to summon the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. The accused had claimed that there were discrepancies in the claim of the complainant and that the Income Tax Returns would bring these discrepancies to the notice of the court. However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call the Income Tax records of the complainant at this stage.

The court observed that the accused had not made out a case for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant. The court noted that the accused had not pointed out any specific discrepancy in the claim of the complainant and had merely made a general allegation of discrepancies. The court also observed that the accused had not shown how the Income Tax Returns of the complainant would be relevant to the case.

The court further observed that the accused had not made any effort to obtain the Income Tax Returns of the complainant from the Income Tax Department. The court noted that the accused had merely made a bald assertion that there were discrepancies in the claim of the complainant and had not produced any evidence to support this assertion.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the application filed by the accused under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.
