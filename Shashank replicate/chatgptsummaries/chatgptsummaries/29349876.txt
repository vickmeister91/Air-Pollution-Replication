In the first court order, the complainants had filed a complaint against the accused persons for cheating and breach of contract. The learned Magistrate had dismissed the complaint under Section 203 of the Cr.P.C. which allows a Magistrate to dismiss a complaint if he finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding. However, the Revisionary Court allowed the application filed by the complainants under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and set aside the order dismissing the complaint.

The accused persons then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the complaint and proceedings arising therefrom. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The accused persons argued that the complaint was an abuse of process of Criminal Courts and cannot be allowed to continue.

The High Court allowed the petition and quashed the complaint and proceedings. The High Court observed that the complainants had entered into an agreement with the accused persons and had received a substantial amount of money. However, the complainants had failed to perform their part of the agreement and had also failed to return the money received from the accused persons. The High Court held that the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention to harass the accused persons and to extract more money from them.
