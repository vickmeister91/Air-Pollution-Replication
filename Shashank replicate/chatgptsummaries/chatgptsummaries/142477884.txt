The Supreme Court of India has granted Sylvester D'Souza four weeks to file an appeal before the National Green Tribunal against the order of demolition of structures passed by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority. The court has also extended the interim relief for a limited period of four weeks or until the appeal is taken up by the National Green Tribunal, whichever is earlier. The court did not express any opinion on the contentions raised by the petitioner or the merits of the appeal.

The case pertains to the demolition of structures built by D'Souza in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority had issued an order for the demolition of these structures, which was challenged by D'Souza in the National Green Tribunal. The tribunal had dismissed his plea, following which he approached the Supreme Court.

During the hearing, D'Souza's counsel argued that the structures were built before the CRZ notification came into force and that they were not causing any harm to the environment. The counsel also contended that the demolition order was passed without giving D'Souza an opportunity to be heard.

The Supreme Court, while granting D'Souza four weeks to file an appeal before the National Green Tribunal, has not expressed any opinion on the contentions raised by the petitioner or the merits of the appeal. The court has also extended the interim relief for a limited period of four weeks or until the appeal is taken up by the National Green Tribunal, whichever is earlier.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to the CRZ norms and the need for proper enforcement of these regulations. The CRZ norms are aimed at protecting the coastal environment and preventing its degradation. Violation of these norms can have serious consequences for the environment and the people living in the coastal areas.

The Supreme Court's decision to grant D'Souza four weeks to file an appeal before the National Green Tribunal and to extend the interim relief for a limited period of four weeks or until the appeal is taken up by the National Green Tribunal, whichever is earlier, is a welcome move. It provides D'Souza with an opportunity to present his case before the tribunal and seek a review of the demolition order.

At the same time, it is important to ensure that the CRZ norms are strictly enforced and that violations are dealt with in a timely and effective manner. This requires a coordinated effort by the authorities responsible for enforcing these regulations, as well as greater awareness among the public about the importance of protecting the coastal environment.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision to grant Sylvester D'Souza four weeks to file an appeal before the National Green Tribunal against the order of demolition of structures passed by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority is a positive development. It provides D'Souza with an opportunity to present his case before the tribunal and seek a review of the demolition order. However, it is important to ensure that the CRZ norms are strictly enforced and that violations are dealt with in a timely and effective manner to protect the coastal environment.
