Heidelberg Cement India Limited filed an application requesting the opponents to execute a mining lease without delay. The application is related to a Special Civil Application No. 417 of 2017, which challenges the vires of section 10-A(2)(c) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation Act), 1957 and Rule 8(4) of the Mineral (other than Atomic and Hydro Carbons Energy Minerals) Concession Rules,2016. The court had issued a notice on January 11, 2017, and passed an order related to the issuance of a letter of intent for issuing a mining lease for limestone and Mari mineral in villages. The court also referred to the amendment of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, and Rule 8(4) of the Mineral (Other than Atomic and Hydrocarbons Energy Minerals) Concession Rules, 2016. The court clarified that the environmental clearance is required before executing the lease deed.

The court order clarifies that mining lease applications will be considered under certain conditions, even if environmental clearance has not been obtained by a certain date. However, no mining activity can commence until environmental clearance is obtained. The court directs the respondents not to give effect to a certain rule, but this does not preclude them from issuing environmental clearance or taking appropriate steps for lease grant. The applicant must fulfill certain conditions, including payment of exploration charges and depositing stamp duty, before the lease deed can be executed. The court notes that environmental clearance is required before mining activity can commence.

The court has ordered the respondents to execute a mining lease without delay upon depositing exploration charges and furnishing a bank guarantee. The environmental clearance certificate is not required for execution of the lease, but the applicant must provide an undertaking not to undertake mining activity until the certificate is obtained. The interim application is disposed of and the case will be placed on July 10, 2018.

This is an important point as it ensures that companies do not start mining without obtaining the necessary clearances. The court has also made it clear that the environmental clearance certificate is not required for execution of the lease, but the applicant must provide an undertaking not to undertake mining activity until the certificate is obtained.

In conclusion, the court has granted relief to Heidelberg Cement India Limited in its application for the execution of a mining lease without delay. The court
