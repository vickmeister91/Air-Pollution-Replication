The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by P. Mythili seeking to quash a summon issued by the police under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) in Crime No.2 of 2018.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C empowers a court or an officer in charge of a police station to issue a summon or a written order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

The petitioner had also contended that the summon was issued with a mala fide intention to harass her.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation by attending the enquiry. The court observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for quashing the summon and that the police had the power to issue the summon under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any material to support her contention that the summon was issued with a mala fide intention.

The court further directed the police to issue a fresh summon to the petitioner with a date and time for her appearance.

The court warned that failure to comply with the directions would result in appropriate action being taken against the petitioner.
