The court order pertains to a petition filed by Dr. Baldev Singh Wazir against a government order that designated him as Professor, General Surgery, and directed the post of Professor in the Department of Urology to be re-advertised. The petitioner was appointed as Lecturer (General Surgery) in the respondent Institute in 1989 and was asked to work in the Department of Urology. The petitioner was retained in the Department of Urology due to a shortage of faculty and was subsequently appointed as Professor in the Department of Urology. However, his appointment was challenged by a faculty member in the Department of Urology, and a Committee was constituted to assess the petitioner's eligibility to head the Department of Urology. The Committee found the petitioner ineligible for the post of Professor, Urology, as he did not possess the requisite qualifications and experience. The petitioner challenged the Committee's recommendations and the government order based on those recommendations. The court held that the petitioner did not possess the qualifications and experience prescribed under the Minimum Qualifications for Teachers in Medical Institution Regulations, 1998, for the post of Professor, Urology, and dismissed the petition.

The court order dismisses a petition seeking appointment as Professor Urology in a medical institute. The petitioner lacked the necessary qualifications and experience required for the position. The court also rejected the argument that the petitioner was not given an opportunity to be heard before the appointment was revoked, as the appointment was illegal and in violation of regulations. The court ordered the institute to initiate a selection process for the position in accordance with rules.

The respondent Institute is expected to complete the selection process by March 5, 2013. The court order dismisses a writ petition and recalls any interim orders in place. It clears the way for the selection process for the post of Professor, Urology, to begin in accordance with rules.
