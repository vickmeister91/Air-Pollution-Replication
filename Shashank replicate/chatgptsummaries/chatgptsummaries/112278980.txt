The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the operation of stone crushing units in the state of Punjab, India. The first court order, dated 10.5.2013, was in response to a writ petition filed by a petitioner who requested permission to run his stone crushing unit by getting materials from neighboring states due to a ban on extracting sand, stone, gravel, etc. The court noted that many stone crushers were operating in ecologically sensitive areas like river beds and catchment areas, which could adversely affect the flow of water and cause environmental degradation. The court directed the state of Punjab to convene a meeting to reconsider the citing parameters and define the terms "river bed," "choe," and "catchment area" before the next hearing. The writ petition was put for hearing on 10.5.2013 to consider the prohibition imposed by the state of Punjab on other stone crushers.

The second court order notes that many stone crushers are operating in environmentally sensitive areas and directs the state authorities to reconsider the parameters for allowing them to operate. The state later frames policy guidelines for stone crushers and amends them to prevent environmental degradation. However, the court notes that the amendments only apply to new units and directs the Pollution Control Board to ensure that existing units comply with the new guidelines before renewal is granted. The Board submits an affidavit confirming compliance.

The third court order discusses a meeting held to identify the location of stone crushers/washing plants in Punjab and to establish guidelines for their shifting. Existing stone crushers in violation of amended notifications must be shifted within two years and located according to guidelines. Existing stone crushers located in river beds must be shifted within one year. Consent granted to running crushing units under pollution control acts shall be renewed accordingly. The District Mining Officer is responsible for verifying the credentials of all stone crushing units in their district and ensuring they do not extract any crushing material illegally. Any unit that fails to shift as per the conditions will be closed, and no further permission will be granted to run any such unit. A compliance report must be submitted after the expiry of the two-year period.
