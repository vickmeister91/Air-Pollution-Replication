The case of Pankaj Ladda vs. Surendra Singh was brought before the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur. The petitioner, Pankaj Ladda, had filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Special Magistrate, N.I. Act Cases No.3, Jodhpur Metropolitan, which dismissed his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner had requested the court to summon the copy of the agreement executed between him and the respondent-complainant, Surendra Singh. However, the trial court rejected the application, stating that the petitioner had failed to give any reason for summoning the agreement and that the burden of proving the allegation was on the complainant.

The petitioner argued that the agreement was necessary to prove his innocence in the case. He contended that the agreement contained a clause that stated that the complainant had no objection to the petitioner using the disputed property for commercial purposes. The petitioner had used the property for commercial purposes, and the complainant had filed a case against him, alleging that he had trespassed on the property. The petitioner argued that the agreement proved that he had not trespassed on the property and that he had the right to use it for commercial purposes.

The trial court, however, rejected the petitioner's argument and dismissed his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The trial court held that the petitioner had failed to give any reason for summoning the agreement and that the burden of proving the allegation was on the complainant.

The petitioner then filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur. The High Court dismissed the petition, finding no illegality in the trial court's order. The High Court held that the petitioner had failed to show any illegality or irregularity in the trial court's order and that the trial court had correctly applied the law.

The High Court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the agreement before the trial court. The High Court held that the petitioner could have produced the agreement before the trial court and that the trial court would have considered it if it was relevant to the case. The High Court held that the petitioner had failed to show any reason why the agreement was necessary for the case.
