The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation filed by Dinesh Bothra against the State of Rajasthan and others, seeking to restrain the allotment of a quarry license for mining activities in Sihanda area without obtaining prior environmental clearance as mandated by the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The petitioner argued that the State Government is required to obtain prior environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests as the proposed mining activity falls within the purview of Category 'A' of the EIA Notification of 2006. The court agreed with the petitioner and directed the respondent Mining Department to obtain prior environmental clearance before proceeding with any mining operation in the area.

The court order states that mining activities on an area of more than 50 hectares fall under Category 'A' of the EIA Notification of 2006 and have a significant impact on the environment. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and protection of forests, flora, and fauna. The order also cites various laws and court cases related to environmental protection and sustainable development. The court concludes that no mining lease can be executed or possession handed over without obtaining prior environmental clearance as mandated under the EIA Notification of 2006. The respondents are restrained from making any allotment of land or executing any mining leases without the requisite clearance.
