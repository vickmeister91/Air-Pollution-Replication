The Madras High Court recently heard an appeal against a judgment and decree passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge in a case between Quibus Resources India Private Limited and Dr. R. Tharani and K.B.R. Kariappa. The plaintiff had filed a suit seeking damages and a permanent injunction against the defendants for interfering with the operation of a generator installed by the plaintiff in the suit premises. The defendants filed a counterclaim seeking a mandatory injunction directing the plaintiff to remove the generator and shift it to a place provided as per the approved plan. The trial court dismissed the suit and allowed the counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed on various grounds, and the High Court considered the issues of whether the lower court framed relevant issues, whether the plaintiff established that the installation of the generator was approved by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and functioned in accordance with norms, whether the trial court was justified in accepting the counterclaim, and whether there was any perversity or illegality in the judgment and decree of the trial court. 

The High Court found that the generator was not in the place envisaged in the approved plan and that the plaintiff had not proved its case. The court held that the trial court had framed relevant issues and that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the installation of the generator was approved by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and functioned in accordance with norms. The High Court also found that the trial court was justified in accepting the counterclaim and that there was no perversity or illegality in the judgment and decree of the trial court. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

In another court order (CTC 483), the court addressed the issue of violation of building regulations and encroachments on public streets and pavements in Tamil Nadu. The court directed the municipal authorities to clear the encroachments and demolish illegal constructions. The court also stated that no civil court can entertain any suit or proceedings against the action taken by the authorities. The order further discussed a case involving the installation of a generator in a common area and remanded the matter back to the trial court for further examination. The court also issued interim orders allowing the plaintiff to continue running the generator subject to certain conditions.

The court's order regarding the violation of building regulations and encroachments on public streets and pavements in Tamil Nadu is significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to building regulations and not encroaching on public spaces. The court's directive to the municipal authorities to clear the encroachments and demolish illegal constructions is a step towards ensuring that public spaces are not encroached upon and that building regulations are followed.

The court's order regarding the installation of a generator in a common area is also significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to approved plans and obtaining necessary approvals before installing any equipment. The court found that the generator was not in the place envisaged in the approved plan and that the plaintiff had not proved its case. The court's decision to remand the matter back to the trial court for further examination is a step towards ensuring that the matter is examined thoroughly and that justice is served.

In conclusion, the court's orders highlight the importance of adhering to building regulations and approved plans and obtaining necessary approvals before installing any equipment. The court's directive to the municipal authorities to clear the encroachments and demolish illegal constructions is a step towards ensuring that public spaces are not encroached upon and that building regulations are followed.
