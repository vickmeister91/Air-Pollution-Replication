In the first court order, Ravindra Jainar and P. Venkatesh Shetty filed a criminal petition seeking to quash the proceedings against them in a case related to the illegal transportation of tortoises under the Wildlife Protection Act. The petitioners argued that the complaint was not maintainable as it was not filed by the competent authority and that the police officer who filed the complaint had a personal vendetta against them. The court ruled that the complaint was not maintainable as the police officer did not have the authority to file it and quashed the proceedings against the petitioners.

The case involved the illegal transportation of tortoises, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The police officer who filed the complaint did not have the authority to do so, as only a competent authority can file a complaint under the Act. The petitioners argued that the police officer had a personal vendetta against them, which was why he filed the complaint. The court found that the complaint was not maintainable and quashed the proceedings against the petitioners.

In the second court order, the court ruled that only a Police Sub-Inspector (PSI) can lodge a complaint under the Women's Protection Act, and Sub-Inspectors of Police are not authorized to do so. As a result, the taking of cognizance is considered bad in law, and all further proceedings are also considered illegal. The petitioners had made a good case for quashing the proceedings initiated against them, and therefore, all further proceedings in C.C. No.137/2012 were quashed. However, the competent authorities can take appropriate action against the petitioners if needed.
