The Bombay High Court recently dismissed a complaint filed by six Data Entry Operators who were seeking permanent work status and consequential benefits from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The court found that the petitioners were engaged on fixed term contracts for a specific purpose and were not recruited through regular selection. The court also found that the termination of their contracts did not constitute retrenchment and that the petitioners were not entitled to permanency under Model Standing Order 4-C. The court concluded that no unfair labor practice had been established and that the Industrial Court's decision did not warrant interference.

The petitioners were appointed by the Board on a contractual basis to complete specific programming work. However, their services were discontinued in March 2004. The Board does not have any post of Computer Operator or Computer Programmer in its establishment, and therefore, cannot consider the reappointment of the petitioners. The Industrial Court had earlier concluded that there was no merit in the complaint preferred by the petitioners, and the High Court upheld this decision.

The court order states that petitioners who were appointed under fixed term contracts cannot claim the benefit of permanency under Model Standing Order 4-C. The Model Standing Order 4-C provides for the regularization of employees who have completed a certain period of continuous service. However, the court found that the petitioners were not eligible for regularization as they were not appointed through regular selection and were engaged on fixed term contracts for a specific purpose.

The court also found that the termination of the petitioners' contracts did not constitute retrenchment. Retrenchment refers to the termination of an employee's services due to reasons such as closure of the establishment, reduction in workforce, or financial difficulties. The court found that the termination of the petitioners' contracts was not due to any of these reasons and therefore did not constitute retrenchment.

The court further noted that the Industrial Court had considered all the relevant factors and had arrived at a just and proper decision. The High Court found no reason to interfere with the Industrial Court's decision and dismissed the petition with no costs.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of employment before accepting a job offer. Employees who are engaged on fixed term contracts for a specific purpose cannot claim the benefit of permanency under Model Standing Order 4-C. Additionally, the termination of a contract does not necessarily constitute retrenchment, and employees may not be entitled to any consequential benefits in such cases. It is important for both employers and employees to be aware of their rights and obligations under the law to avoid any disputes or legal complications in the future.
