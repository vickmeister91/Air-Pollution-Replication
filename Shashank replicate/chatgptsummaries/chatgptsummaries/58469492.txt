The case in question involved a petitioner who had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Special Judge, Mandsaur in S.T. No.11/15. The order had rejected an application filed by the petitioner under Section 91,92 of the Cr.P.C read with Section 65 of the I.T. Act. The petitioner was being proceeded against for an offense under Section 8/18 of the NDPS Act.

The Counsel for the petitioner argued that it was a case of false implication and that it was of utmost importance to establish the presence of the police officers on the spot. The application filed by the petitioner had requested that the call details of certain mobile numbers be preserved as evidence. However, the trial court had dismissed the application, stating that the mobile numbers were not connected with the offense and were not necessary under the circumstances.

The petitioner's petition was allowed, and it was directed that the learned Trial Court shall direct the concerned service provider companies to preserve the call details of the mobile numbers mentioned for the period of three days during the pendency of the trial.

This case highlights the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases. The call details of the mobile numbers in question could potentially provide crucial evidence in establishing the presence of the police officers on the spot and could help to prove the petitioner's claim of false implication.

It is also worth noting that the petitioner had filed the petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. This section allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the High Court had used its inherent powers to ensure that crucial evidence was preserved for the trial.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases and the role that the High Court can play in ensuring that justice is served.
