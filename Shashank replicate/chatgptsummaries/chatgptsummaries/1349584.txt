In the case of Deevan Arjun Singh vs State And Anr., the petitioner sought the quashment of two orders and interim custody of his Armada Jeep, which was confiscated by Forest Officers for offences under the Wild Life (Profession) Act. The petitioner claimed that he is the registered owner of the vehicle and cited a Full Bench ruling that any property seized on accusation or suspicion of commission of an offence under the Act can be released by the Magistrate pending trial.

The court found that since the criminal case is not disposed of, there is no finding of competent Court on the fact that the vehicle seized has been used for committing an offence. Therefore, the C.J.M. Narsinghpur is directed to dispose of the petitioner's Supurdgi application afresh.

The case highlights the importance of following due process in the confiscation of property. The Full Bench ruling cited by the petitioner emphasizes the need for a competent court to make a finding on whether the seized property has been used for committing an offence. In the absence of such a finding, the property cannot be confiscated.

The court's decision to direct the C.J.M. Narsinghpur to dispose of the petitioner's Supurdgi application afresh underscores the need for proper disposal of such applications. The Supurdgi application is a legal document that allows for the release of seized property pending trial. The court's direction ensures that the application is disposed of in accordance with the law.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of following due process in the confiscation of property. It also emphasizes the need for proper disposal of legal applications such as the Supurdgi application. By following due process and disposing of legal applications properly, the rights of individuals can be protected and justice can be served.
