The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ petitions filed by employees who were terminated from their jobs. The petitions involve the cancellation of regularization of service of the petitioners without notice or opportunity to be heard, and the question of whether they are entitled to re-engagement and regularization in service. The court also notes that the cancellation of appointments may be illegal, discriminatory, and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

In one of the court orders, the court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately found that the cancellation of the employees' regularization was illegal and violated their constitutional rights. The court ordered that the employees be re-inducted and regularized in their positions. In another court order, the court discusses the regularisation of service for government employees and cites the Umadevi (3) case, which states that persons appointed on a contractual basis cannot be regularised into regular service without following proper procedures for recruitment. The court ultimately concludes that the petitioners in the case were appointed on a contract basis and their services could not have been regularised, and therefore their services were cancelled in accordance with the law.

The court also notes that before an order in favor of someone can be followed, it must be investigated to ensure it is legal and valid. If it is found to be illegal or unwarranted, it cannot be used as a basis for issuing a writ compelling the respondent authority to repeat the illegality. The court cannot exercise its power for such a purpose. The order also discusses the illegality of regularizing the petitioners' services in disregard of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Umadevi (3) case. The court cannot interfere with canceling the orders of regularisation of the petitioners. The court cannot issue a writ of mandamus to an authority if it has already exercised its duty.

In another court order, the court has ruled that if an authority has made an illegal or unwarranted order, the High Court cannot force them to repeat the same mistake. Instead, the authority should correct the mistake according to the law. If it cannot be corrected, it cannot be used as a basis for repetition. The court has dismissed the writ petitions and the petitioners are not entitled to any relief.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures for recruitment and regularization of service for government employees. The court emphasizes that the cancellation of appointments may be illegal and discriminatory, and that employees claiming regularization must have been appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process. The court also notes that before an order in favor of someone can be followed, it must be investigated to ensure it is legal and valid. If it is found to be illegal or unwarranted, it cannot be used as a basis for issuing a writ compelling the respondent authority to repeat the illegality.
