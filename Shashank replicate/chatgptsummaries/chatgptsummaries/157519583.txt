The court order pertains to the preparation of District Survey Reports (DSR) for minor minerals other than sand and bajri in the state of Jharkhand. The court had directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) to take a decision on the format for the preparation of DSR within eight weeks. The MoEF & CC has filed an affidavit in compliance with the court's direction, but the court finds that the affidavit falls short of delegation of power to the State Government or the concerned DEIAA or DEAC under the provisions of Environment Protection Act, 1986 for laying down format to meet the specific requirement of the particular minor minerals found in such districts of the State.

The court directs the Secretary, MoEF & CC, Government of India to appear in person or entrust any sufficiently high ranking official dealing with the subject but not lower than the rank of Joint Secretary of the Ministry to appear and explain. The matter is listed for the next hearing on 05.07.2018.
