The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Mumbai recently heard appeals from Indo Rama Synthetics (I) Ltd. against orders passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Nagpur. The Commissioner had disallowed credit on certain items declared as capital goods and demanded payment of Rs. 3,63,05,053/- towards wrongly availed credit. The Tribunal confirmed the demand and imposed a penalty of the same amount on Indo Rama Synthetics Ltd. under Rule 15 of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The Tribunal also imposed a penalty of Rs. 36,00,000/- on Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. under Rule 26 of Central Excise Rules, 2002. The Tribunal found that the credit taken by the appellants was irregular and inadmissible under the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004.

The appellants have filed appeals challenging the order, arguing that they have correctly taken credit for capital goods used in their factory premises and that the demand is barred by limitation. They also argue that the denial of credit on certain items is incorrect and that the power purchase agreement should not be used to decide eligibility for credit. The court hears arguments from both sides and considers previous decisions on similar issues before making a ruling.

In one case, the court found that the appellant was eligible for the credit and that the denial of credit by the revenue was fallacious. The court also found that penalties could not be imposed as the duty was not payable. The court discussed various agreements and permissions related to the setting up of a TPP and found that the second party had leased premises from the appellant and that the premises were legally not part of the appellant's premises. The court also found that the show cause notice seeking to deny credit was issued within the normal period of limitation.

In another case, the court determined that the leased premises are legally not part of the appellant's factory and that the second party is a separate legal entity with its own liabilities and duties. The court also discussed various legal provisions and case law related to the eligibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods and concluded that the appellant is not entitled to the credit claimed and is liable for interest and penalty. The court also considered other issues related to the ownership and operation of the thermal power plant on the leased plot of land.

In yet another case, the court rejected the appellant's claim that the entire plot of land should be considered as their factory premises for the manufacture of finished goods. The court also noted that the 2nd party was paying for all services provided by the appellant and was the owner and operator of the power plant.

In a separate case, the court found that the second party was procuring the goods for their own use and not for the first party. The capital goods were capitalized in the books of accounts of the second party, and they were generating profits for themselves by selling power. The first party had no authority over the second party or the power plant.

In another case, the court found that the second party was operating and maintaining a thermal power plant for their own profit, and the appellant had no authority over them. The goods covered by the invoices on which the appellant was shown as consignee were never received by them in their factory premises but were received by the second party on the plot leased out to them by the appellant. The court also discussed the admissibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods, stating that it can only be availed if the goods are received in the factory of the manufacturer of the final product and used in the factory of manufacture.

In yet another case, the court relied on previous case laws to determine that the appellants are entitled to CENVAT credit on the capital goods used for manufacturing CPP by JSWPL, which is being used by the appellants to manufacture their final product, iron and steel. The court also distinguishes this case from previous cases where the premises were leased out to another company. The court concludes that the appellants are not entitled to CENVAT credit in respect of the inputs and capital goods procured by the lessor.

In another case, the court found that the Tribunal had allowed the appeal of the company without proper appreciation of the transactions in the light of relevant provisions of the Central Excise Act and Rules. The court also held that ownership of capital goods is not relevant for determining eligibility for CENVAT credit, but receipt and usage are. The court further discussed the admissibility of credit in respect of goods that are not identifiable and classified under Chapter 84 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The court also considered the issue of limitation and penalty under Rule 15 of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The court found that the demand was not hit by limitation, but the charge of suppression was well established against the appellant company. The matter was remanded back to the Commissioner for determination of CENVAT credit to be disallowed after the merger of the two entities.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed various cases related to the eligibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods and the ownership and operation of thermal power plants. The court considered previous case laws and legal provisions before making a ruling. In some cases, the court found that the appellants were entitled to the credit, while in others, the court found that
