The Karnataka High Court recently issued an order in response to a representation dated 23rd September 2019. The court directed the second respondent to make a decision on the representation in accordance with the law and communicate the orders passed to the petitioner within four weeks. The court also stated that all contentions on merits are kept open.

The court noted that it would have relegated the petitioner to the remedy of appeal under clause (c) of Section 33B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the petitioner is confining the prayer in the petition only to one direction regarding disposal of the representation.

The court's order is significant because it directs the second respondent to make a decision on the representation within a specific timeframe. This ensures that the petitioner will receive a response to their representation in a timely manner. Additionally, the court's decision to keep all contentions on merits open means that the petitioner can still argue their case on its merits if necessary.

The court's decision to not relegate the petitioner to the remedy of appeal under clause (c) of Section 33B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is also noteworthy. This clause allows for appeals to be made to the National Green Tribunal against orders passed by the State Pollution Control Board. However, the court's decision indicates that the petitioner's case can be resolved without resorting to an appeal.

Overall, the Karnataka High Court's order is a positive development for the petitioner. It ensures that their representation will be considered and responded to within a specific timeframe, and allows for the petitioner to argue their case on its merits if necessary. The court's decision to not relegate the petitioner to the remedy of appeal under clause (c) of Section 33B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 also indicates that the case can be resolved without resorting to an appeal.
