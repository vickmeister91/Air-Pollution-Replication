Mahaveer, who was accused of transportation of Bajri and charged under Sections 379, 332, 353, 324, 307 I.P.C. and Section 29/51 of Wild Protection Act, has been granted bail by the court. The court found no allegations against the petitioner and no overt act assigned to him. Mahaveer has been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties in the sum of Rs. 25,000 each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court.

The case against Mahaveer was related to the transportation of Bajri, which is a type of sand used in construction. He was charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Wild Protection Act. However, the court found no evidence to support the allegations against him and no overt act assigned to him. As a result, he was granted bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Mahaveer was based on several factors. First, there was no evidence to support the allegations against him. Second, he had no prior criminal record and was not considered a flight risk. Third, he had cooperated with the authorities throughout the investigation and had not attempted to obstruct justice in any way.

In order to secure his release, Mahaveer was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties in the sum of Rs. 25,000 each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This was done to ensure that he would appear in court when required and would not attempt to flee the jurisdiction.

The decision to grant bail to Mahaveer was not without controversy. Some argued that he should have been held in custody until the trial was completed, given the seriousness of the charges against him. Others argued that he was entitled to bail under the law, given the lack of evidence against him and his cooperation with the authorities.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Mahaveer was based on a careful consideration of the facts and the law. While some may disagree with the decision, it was made in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness. As the case moves forward, it will be up to the prosecution to prove their case against Mahaveer beyond a reasonable doubt.
