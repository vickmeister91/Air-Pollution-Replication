The first case involves the death of a man due to electrocution from a snapped live wire. The man's family sued the A.P. State Electricity Board for damages and compensation, claiming negligence and failure to take reasonable precautions. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the burden of proof was wrongly placed on them and that the defendants failed to take proper care.

The appellate court held that the burden of proof rested on the defendants and that they failed to prove that they had taken all necessary precautions. The court also noted that the doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur applied, meaning that the accident was of a kind that would not have happened if proper care had been taken. This doctrine shifts the burden of proof to the defendant, who must prove that they were not negligent.

The court found that the defendants had failed to take proper care and were therefore negligent. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of negligence, which the defendants had failed to rebut. The court held that the defendants were liable for damages and compensation to the family of the deceased.

In the second case, the court found the defendants negligent in failing to prevent the death of a pedestrian who came into contact with a live wire hanging from an electric pole. The court rejected the claim of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased and awarded compensation to the family of the deceased based on his annual earnings and the number of dependents.

The defendants were ordered to pay Rs. 2,05,000/- in damages or compensation with interest. No costs were awarded, but the defendants were required to pay the court fees.

In both cases, the courts found the defendants negligent and liable for damages and compensation. The courts also rejected the defendants' claims of contributory negligence and placed the burden of proof on the defendants to prove that they had taken all necessary precautions.

These cases highlight the importance of taking proper care and precautions to prevent accidents and injuries. The doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur places a heavy burden on defendants to prove that they were not negligent, and failure to do so can result in liability for damages and compensation.

It is important for individuals and organizations to take all necessary precautions to prevent accidents and injuries, and to be prepared to defend themselves in court if necessary. Negligence can have serious consequences, both in terms of legal liability and the harm caused to individuals and their families.
