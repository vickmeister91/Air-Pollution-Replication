The court has recently issued orders in two separate cases related to noise and dust pollution caused by construction activities in Chennai. In the first case, the Sri Ponniamman Nagar Residents Welfare Association filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to direct the respondents to take appropriate action on their representation regarding lands acquired by the government and handed over to the Slum Clearance Board for construction. The petitioner alleged that respondents 9 and 10 were causing noise pollution and dust by adopting Hammer Pile method instead of Ring Pile method between 6.00 a.m. and 10.00 p.m.

The court ordered an enquiry and appropriate action in accordance with the law. The court directed the respondents to take necessary steps to ensure that the construction activities do not cause any noise or dust pollution. The court also directed the respondents to take appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of the construction activities on the environment and the health of the residents. The court further directed the respondents to submit a report on the steps taken within four weeks.

In the second case, the court order pertained to a petition filed by a person complaining about the noise and dust pollution caused by the Ring Pile method of laying foundation. The petitioner cited a research paper from Cambridge University to support their claim that the hammer pile method is an unsuitable and archaic method. The court considered the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which prescribe the permissible noise levels in different areas. The petitioner needed to establish whether the noise pollution caused by the hammer pile method exceeded the ambient air quality standards.

The court order required the petitioner to establish whether the noise pollution caused by the hammer pile method exceeded the ambient air quality standards and approach the Pollution Control Board for verification. The court also stated that it was not their role to decide which piling operation should be used and dismissed the frivolous writ petition without imposing costs. The order was addressed to various government officials and agencies.

The court's orders in both cases highlight the importance of mitigating the impact of construction activities on the environment and the health of the residents. The court has directed the respondents to take necessary steps to ensure that the construction activities do not cause any noise or dust pollution. The court has also directed the petitioner to establish whether the noise pollution caused by the hammer pile method exceeded the ambient air quality standards and approach the Pollution Control Board for verification.

The court's orders are in line with the principles of sustainable development, which require balancing economic development with environmental protection and social welfare. The court has recognized the importance of protecting the environment and the health of the residents, while also ensuring that the construction activities are not unduly hampered. The court's orders are a step in the right direction towards achieving sustainable development in Chennai.
