The case in question involves a petitioner named Sambhu Mian, also known as Samir Haidar, who has filed an application under section 482 of the Cr. P.C. to quash an order passed by C.J.M., Sheikhpura in Trial No. 1159 of 2013. The order in question was passed on 20.04.2013 and arises out of Sheikhpura P.S. Case No. 391 of 2012. The order takes cognizance against the petitioner for several offences, including section 379/34 of the I.P.C., 3/4/5 Explosive Substance Act, 40 B.M.M.C. Act, 8 of Bihar Illegal Mines Storage and Transportation Act, and 4 & 5 of the Environment Act.

The petitioner has requested that the order taking cognizance be quashed, but the court has refused this prayer and dismissed the application. This means that the case will proceed as planned, and the petitioner will have to face the charges against him.

It is important to note that section 482 of the Cr. P.C. allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner is arguing that the order taking cognizance is an abuse of the court's process and that it should be quashed.

However, the court has determined that the order taking cognizance is not an abuse of the court's process and that the case should proceed. This decision is based on the evidence presented and the nature of the charges against the petitioner.

The charges against the petitioner are serious and include offences related to the storage and transportation of illegal mines, as well as violations of environmental laws. These charges are not to be taken lightly, and it is important that the case proceeds so that justice can be served.

In conclusion, the court has refused the petitioner's request to quash the order taking cognizance and has dismissed the application. The case will proceed as planned, and the petitioner will have to face the charges against him. It is important that justice is served in this case, given the serious nature of the charges against the petitioner.
