The first court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff had filed a suit seeking permanent injunction against the demolition of a constructed area in his flat. The defendants had filed applications for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. The court rejected the plaintiff's prayer for injunction as he had already challenged the demolition order before the Ld. Appellate Tribunal, MCD and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was barred under the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. The court also noted that the plaintiff had already obtained the copy of the sanctioned plan and completion plan from the defendants, rendering his second prayer redundant.

In the second court order, the court rejected an application by the plaintiff to amend their complaint in a case against the Delhi Development Authority and a cooperative society. The plaintiff had sought a permanent injunction to prevent the demolition of a covered area in their flat, as well as a direction to provide a copy of the sanction plan and completion plan. The plaintiff also sought to add additional prayers to the suit, including a request for the DDA to consider their application for regularization of structural amendments without seeking a no-objection certificate from the society. The court found that the plaintiff had not raised the issue of lacunas in their original complaint and that the requested amendments were in contravention of relevant laws. The court allowed the defendants' application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, rejecting the plaintiff's complaint.

The third court order states that the plaintiff cannot be allowed to amend his suit as he himself is guilty of unauthorized construction. Only defendant no. 2 has the right to raise any grievance against the completion plan. The plaintiff has violated the terms of the bye laws and agreement, and hence the present application is liable to be dismissed along with the suit of the plaintiff. The relief sought by the plaintiff cannot be granted as it is within the ambit of Section 70 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act. The court dismisses the application of the plaintiff under provisions of Order VI Rule 17 CPC and allows the application of the defendants under the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 CPC. The plaintiff's suit stands rejected.

In summary, all three court orders pertain to cases where the plaintiff had filed suits seeking permanent injunctions against the demolition of constructed areas in their flats. In the first order, the court rejected the plaintiff's prayer for injunction as he had already challenged the demolition order before the Ld. Appellate Tribunal, MCD and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was barred under the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. In the second order, the court rejected the plaintiff's application to amend their complaint as the requested amendments were in contravention of relevant laws. In the third order, the court dismissed the plaintiff's application to amend their suit as he himself was guilty of unauthorized construction and the relief sought by the plaintiff was within the ambit of Section 70 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act. In all three cases, the court allowed the defendants' applications under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, rejecting the plaintiff's complaints.
