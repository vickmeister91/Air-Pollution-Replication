Tata Chemicals Limited, a leading Indian multinational company, filed a petition in the Gujarat High Court requesting a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ to quash and set aside orders passed by the Range Forest Officer, Marine National Park, Dwarka. The orders directed the company not to enter Marine National Park/Marine Sanctuary or the forest area in question. The orders were passed pursuant to the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The company argued that the orders were arbitrary, illegal, and without jurisdiction. The company claimed that it had been carrying out its business activities in the area for over 25 years and had all the necessary permissions and clearances from the concerned authorities. The company further argued that the orders were passed without giving it an opportunity to be heard and without considering the facts and circumstances of the case.

The Gujarat High Court heard the petition and ordered that the matter be heard along with another similar case filed as a Public Interest Litigation. The court observed that the issues raised in both cases were similar and that it would be appropriate to hear them together. The court also directed the concerned authorities to file their responses to the petitions.

The court noted that the interim relief granted in the other case would continue until further orders. The court also directed that the continuation of interim relief in the present case would be considered by the court which heard the other case. The court further directed that the matter be listed for further hearing after the responses of the concerned authorities were filed.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament for the protection of wild animals and plants.
