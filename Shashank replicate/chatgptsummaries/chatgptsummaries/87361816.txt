The court order in question pertains to a circular issued by the Chief Secretary of the State Government in India, which required industrial units to obtain permission from the Collector and Divisional Commissioner before being inspected by the Regional Officer of the Pollution Control Board. The circular was challenged by a writ petition filed by the petitioner, who argued that it was unlawful and in conflict with the statutory powers and duties of the State Board under the Environment Act.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the circular was indeed in conflict with the statutory powers and duties of the State Board under the Environment Act. The court noted that the circular effectively gave the Collector and Divisional Commissioner the power to veto inspections by the Regional Officer of the Pollution Control Board, which was not in line with the provisions of the Environment Act.

The court also noted that the circular was in violation of the principle of separation of powers, as it effectively allowed the executive branch of the government to interfere with the functioning of the State Board, which was an independent statutory body. The court held that the circular was therefore unlawful and quashed it.

The petitioner was granted liberty to not press the writ petition in respect of certain prayer clauses. This means that the petitioner was given the option to withdraw certain parts of the writ petition, while still maintaining the rest of the petition. It is not clear from the court order which prayer clauses the petitioner was granted liberty to not press.

Overall, the court order is significant as it reaffirms the independence and statutory powers of the State Board under the Environment Act. It also highlights the importance of the principle of separation of powers in ensuring that the executive branch of the government does not interfere with the functioning of independent statutory bodies. The quashing of the circular is likely to have a positive impact on the enforcement of environmental laws in the state, as it removes an obstacle to the inspection of industrial units by the Pollution Control Board.
