The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of the right to bail and the conditions that must be met for an accused to be granted bail. The court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant has not been found in possession of any incriminating material and has been made a co-accused based on information given by another accused.

The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and has not been convicted of any offence. The court has therefore granted the applicant anticipatory bail on the condition that he makes himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and abides by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

The court has also made it clear that the order shall remain in force till the end of trial if the applicant furnishes the bail bond and surety bond before the committal Court/trial Court at the time of filing of challan. This ensures that the applicant does not abscond and is available for trial.

However, the court has also given the public prosecutor or complainant the liberty to move the same Court for cancellation or modification of the conditions of bail any time if liberty granted by the Court is misused. This ensures that the accused does not misuse the liberty granted to him and does not commit any further offences.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of the right to bail and the conditions that must be met for an accused to be granted bail. The court has taken into consideration the facts of the case and has granted the applicant anticipatory bail on the condition that he makes himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and abides by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.
