The Punjab National Bank had appealed an order of eviction from a tenanted premises, which was upheld by the Tribunal and the High Court. The eviction was requested under Section 14(1)(k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act on the basis that the tenant had taken the premises for residential purpose but had put it to non-residential use. The Bank agreed to enhance the rent to Rs. 6,000/- per month with effect from October 1, 1986, and the court allowed the appeal, set aside the order of eviction, and dismissed the application for eviction. The Controller was directed to fix the quantum of penalty for wrongful use after hearing counsel for parties and the Delhi Development Authority.

The case involved a dispute between the Punjab National Bank and its tenant over the use of a tenanted premises. The Bank had requested the eviction of the tenant under Section 14(1)(k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, which allows for eviction if the tenant has taken the premises for residential purpose but has put it to non-residential use. The Tribunal and the High Court had upheld the order of eviction, but the Bank had appealed the decision.

During the appeal, the Bank agreed to enhance the rent to Rs. 6,000/- per month with effect from October 1, 1986. The court allowed the appeal, set aside the order of eviction, and dismissed the application for eviction. The Controller was directed to fix the quantum of penalty for wrongful use after hearing counsel for parties and the Delhi Development Authority.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to the terms of a tenancy agreement and using the premises for the intended purpose. If a tenant is found to be using the premises for a non-residential purpose, they may be subject to eviction under Section 14(1)(k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. However, in this case, the Bank was able to avoid eviction by agreeing to enhance the rent and the court set aside the order of eviction.

Overall, the case serves as a reminder to both landlords and tenants to carefully review and adhere to the terms of their tenancy agreement to avoid disputes and potential legal action.
