The National Green Tribunal recently heard two applications related to the establishment of a distillery unit in Chhattarpur, Madhya Pradesh. The first application was filed by M/s Cox India Ltd., seeking an additional grant of 8 KL per day as expansion. However, the Pollution Control Board cancelled the permission. The second application was filed by Balram Raikwar, who sought a mandamus against the State Pollution Control Board to take appropriate legal action against M/s Cox India Ltd. for violating conditions imposed on them.

The Central Pollution Control Board stated that their communication was not statutory in nature and did not direct the State Pollution Control Board to withdraw the expansion proposal. The Tribunal took both applications together and passed a common order. The court order discusses the case involving the distillery company and the withdrawal of permission to establish additional facilities. The court notes that the Central Pollution Control Board has not yet determined whether grain-based distilleries are more polluting than molasses-based ones.

The court also finds that the State Pollution Control Board did not follow the principles of natural justice in withdrawing permission without issuing a show cause notice. The court discusses the concept of natural justice and its evolution in Indian law. The court cites American decisions to explain that "due process of law" implies an objective standard of conduct, notice to the accused, a reasonable opportunity to establish innocence, and an impartial tribunal. The court also notes that the principles of natural justice are so basic that they must be substantially complied with, even if not explicitly stated in a statute.

The court overrules the view expressed in a previous case that natural justice is not a part of law and establishes that giving an opportunity to a person before taking away their right is fundamental and inherent. The court cites Blackstone's view that the law of nature, dictated by God, is superior to any human law. The court discusses the concept of natural justice and its evolution over time through judicial interpretation. The order emphasizes that no one should be a judge in their own cause and that administrative or quasi-judicial acts cannot take away a person's rights without providing them with an opportunity to be heard.

The court also discusses the power of the State Pollution Control Board under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and concludes that the power cannot be used to revoke or withdraw a permission already granted. The court highlights the attitude of the State Pollution Control Board towards the project proponent and their failure to address the condition of the unit.

In another case involving a distillery unit, the court found that the unit was not complying with environmental protection norms and that its effluent treatment plant was non-functional. The court set aside the impugned order and directed the project proponent to plant a minimum of 3000 trees as an interim measure before any decision is made regarding the continuation of the project. The court also held the SPCB and its officials responsible for giving wrong information and suppressing the real situation about the unit.

The court has directed the project proponent to plant a minimum of 3000 trees within three months and maintain them for three years, failing which they will have to pay Rs. 5 lakhs as compensation. The amount will be kept in a separate account as an Environmental Protection Fund and can be used for environmental protection in the state. The court has also urged the State Pollution Control Board to take urgent steps to meet the increasing challenges of environmental protection and degradation. The court has suggested that the MPPCB form a separate research wing with adequate manpower and budget support to improve environmental governance. The court appreciates the efforts made by the MPPCB, State of M.P., project proponent, and committee members.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of natural justice and the need for compliance with environmental protection norms. The court has directed the project proponent to take necessary steps to protect the environment and has held the SPCB and its officials responsible for giving wrong information and suppressing the real situation about the unit. The court has also urged the State Pollution Control Board to take urgent steps to meet the increasing challenges of environmental protection and degradation.
