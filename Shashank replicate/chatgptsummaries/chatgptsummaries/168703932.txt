The recent court order pertains to a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, which sought to quash notices issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board to disconnect the electric supply to the petitioner's shop. The court has directed the petitioner to file an appeal against the order within four weeks, and if filed, the application for condonation of delay will be sympathetically considered. The writ petition has been disposed of.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief from the notices issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board, which had directed the disconnection of the electric supply to the petitioner's shop. The petitioner had argued that the notices were arbitrary and illegal, and that they had been issued without any basis or justification.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the notices issued by the Pollution Control Board were not arbitrary or illegal. The court noted that the notices had been issued in accordance with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the provisions of the Acts under which the notices had been issued. The court held that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for quashing the notices, and accordingly, dismissed the writ petition.

However, the court directed the petitioner to file an appeal against the order within four weeks, and if filed, the application for condonation of delay will be sympathetically considered. The court's direction provides an opportunity for the petitioner to challenge the order and seek relief from the notices issued by the Pollution Control Board.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertains to a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, seeking relief from notices issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board to disconnect the electric supply to the petitioner's shop. The court has dismissed the writ petition, but has directed the petitioner to file an appeal against the order within four weeks, and if filed, the application for condonation of delay will be sympathetically considered. The court's direction provides an opportunity for the petitioner to challenge the order and seek relief from the notices issued by the Pollution Control Board.
