The Karnataka High Court recently received a writ petition from M/S Jayalakshmi Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner requested the court to quash an order passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and to direct the State of Karnataka to consider their application for grant/renewal of license for stone crushers. However, the petitioner withdrew the first prayer, and the court disposed of the petition accordingly, stating that the petition does not survive for any further orders.

The case involved a dispute between M/S Jayalakshmi Stone Crusher and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had applied for a license to operate a stone crusher in the state of Karnataka. However, the application was rejected by the Pollution Control Board on the grounds that the petitioner had not complied with certain environmental regulations.

The petitioner then approached the Karnataka High Court, seeking to quash the order passed by the Pollution Control Board and to direct the State of Karnataka to consider their application for grant/renewal of license for stone crushers. The petitioner argued that the Pollution Control Board had acted arbitrarily and without any basis in rejecting their application.

During the course of the proceedings, the petitioner withdrew their first prayer, which was to quash the order passed by the Pollution Control Board. The court then disposed of the petition, stating that it did not survive for any further orders.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had withdrawn their first prayer, which was the main relief sought in the petition. Since the petitioner had withdrawn this prayer, the court held that there was no further relief that could be granted to the petitioner.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations while operating a stone crusher in the state of Karnataka. The Pollution Control Board has been tasked with ensuring that all stone crushers in the state comply with these regulations, and any non-compliance can result in the rejection of license applications.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all stone crusher operators in the state of Karnataka to comply with environmental regulations and to ensure that their operations do not harm the environment in any way. Failure to do so can result in the rejection of license applications and legal action being taken against the operator.
