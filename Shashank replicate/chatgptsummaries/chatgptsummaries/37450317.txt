The Bombay High Court recently heard a case between Prism Johnson Limited and the State of Maharashtra regarding an order to close the company's operations. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without following proper procedures and violated rules and principles of natural justice. The court agreed with the petitioner and stayed the operation of the order until the next hearing, restoring electricity supply to the petitioner.

The case was heard by a division bench of Justice BP Dharmadhikari and Justice SV Kotwal. The petitioner, Prism Johnson Limited, is a company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cement, ready-mix concrete, and other building materials. The company has been operating in Maharashtra for several years and has several plants and factories in the state.

The State of Maharashtra had issued an order on August 31st, 2018, directing the closure of the company's operations in the state. The order was issued under the provisions of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The order cited several violations of environmental norms and regulations by the company and directed the closure of all its plants and factories in the state.

The petitioner challenged the order in the Bombay High Court, arguing that it was passed without following proper procedures and violated rules and principles of natural justice. The petitioner also argued that the order was arbitrary and unreasonable and would cause irreparable harm to the company and its employees.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and observed that the order appeared to have been passed without following proper procedures. The court noted that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the order was passed and that the order did not specify the reasons for the closure of the company's operations.

The court also observed that the order appeared to be in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the order had been passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to present its case and without considering the petitioner's objections and submissions.

The court, therefore, stayed the operation of the order until the next hearing and directed the respondents to file a reply before September 19th, 2018. The court also directed the respondents to restore electricity supply to the petitioner's plants and factories.

The court's decision is a significant relief for the petitioner, as it allows the company to continue its operations in the state. The court's observations regarding the violation of natural justice and proper procedures are also significant, as they highlight the importance of following due process and principles of fairness in administrative decision-making.

The case is likely to have wider implications for other companies and industries in the state, as it sets a precedent for challenging arbitrary and unreasonable orders issued by regulatory authorities. The case also highlights the need for regulatory authorities to follow proper procedures and principles of natural justice while issuing orders and taking action against companies and industries.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's decision in the case between Prism Johnson Limited and the State of Maharashtra is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the role of regulatory authorities in ensuring environmental compliance by companies and industries. The court's decision highlights the importance of following due process and principles of fairness in administrative decision-making and sets a precedent for challenging arbitrary and unreasonable orders issued by regulatory authorities. The case is likely to have wider implications for other companies and industries in the state and underscores the need for regulatory authorities to act in a transparent and accountable manner while enforcing environmental norms and regulations.
