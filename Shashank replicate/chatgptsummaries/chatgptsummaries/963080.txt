The Banswara Marble Mines Owners Association filed a petition seeking various reliefs, including the quashing of certain stipulations and orders related to compensatory and penal afforestation costs. However, the State Government and Union of India argued that the Supreme Court of India had issued interim orders in a related case that prohibited any court from hearing and deciding petitions related to environmental protection and forest conservation. The court agreed with the State Government and Union of India, stating that the Supreme Court's orders were intended to prevent conflicting or different orders from being made by different courts and tribunals. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition as not maintainable.

In another case, the court dismissed a petition as not maintainable, and the petitioner's counsel requested a certificate of fitness of appeal before the Supreme Court. The counsel argued that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance regarding the scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court to take up writ under Article 226 where analogous matters are pending before the Supreme Court of India. The court deliberated on the submissions and certified that the questions raised are fit to be decided by the Supreme Court of India, granting a certificate to that effect under Article 134A of the Constitution of India.

The Banswara Marble Mines Owners Association filed a petition seeking various reliefs, including the quashing of certain stipulations and orders related to compensatory and penal afforestation costs. The association argued that the stipulations and orders were arbitrary, unreasonable, and violative of the principles of natural justice. The association also contended that the orders were passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard and without considering their objections.

The State Government and Union of India opposed the petition, arguing that the Supreme Court of India had issued interim orders in a related case that prohibited any court from hearing and deciding petitions related to environmental protection and forest conservation. The State Government and Union of India contended that the orders were intended to prevent conflicting or different orders from being made by different courts and tribunals.

The court considered the submissions of both parties and observed that the Supreme Court's orders were intended to prevent conflicting or different orders from being made by different courts and tribunals. The court noted that the orders were issued to ensure that the Supreme Court had the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide matters related to environmental protection and forest conservation.

The court further observed that the Supreme Court's orders were intended to prevent the abuse of the legal process and to ensure that the environment and forests were protected. The court noted that the orders were issued in the larger public interest and were binding on all courts and tribunals in India.

The court, therefore, agreed with the State Government and Union of India and held that the petition was not maintainable. The court observed that the petition was filed in violation of the Supreme Court's orders and was, therefore, liable to be dismissed.

In another case, the court dismissed a petition filed by a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to grant him a license to operate a sawmill. The petitioner contended that he had fulfilled all the requirements for obtaining the license, but the respondents had refused to grant him the license without any reason.

The respondents opposed the petition, contending that the petitioner had not fulfilled all the requirements for obtaining the license. The respondents also contended that the petitioner had suppressed material facts and had made false representations to obtain the license.

The court considered the submissions of both parties and observed that the petitioner had not fulfilled all the requirements for obtaining the license. The court noted that the petitioner had suppressed material facts and had made false representations to obtain the license.

The court, therefore, held that the petitioner was not entitled to the relief sought and dismissed the petition as not maintainable. The court observed that the petitioner had approached the court with unclean hands and was, therefore, not entitled to any relief.

The petitioner's counsel then requested a certificate of fitness of appeal before the Supreme Court, stating that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance regarding the scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court to take up writ under Article 226 where analogous matters are pending before the Supreme Court of India.

The court deliberated on the submissions and certified that the questions raised are fit to be decided by the Supreme Court of India, granting a certificate to that effect under Article 134A of the Constitution of India.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petitions in both cases as not maintainable. In the first case, the court held that the petition was filed in violation of the Supreme Court's orders and was, therefore, liable to be dismissed. In the second case, the court held that the petitioner had approached the court with unclean hands and was, therefore, not entitled to any relief. However, the court granted a certificate of fitness of appeal before the Supreme Court in the second case, stating that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance regarding the scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court to take up writ under Article 226 where analogous matters are pending before the Supreme Court of India.
