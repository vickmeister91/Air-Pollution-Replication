The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Sterlite Industries and the Union of India regarding environmental pollution caused by the industrial unit of the petitioner. The High Court had previously ordered the closure of the unit, but the Supreme Court directed an independent assessment by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to determine the current situation and impact of the unit. NEERI submitted its report, and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board filed a chart of deficiencies and suggested measures to be implemented by the petitioner-industry to improve emission control efficiency and fugitive emission control. The Court directed the Pollution Control Board to file a synopsis specifying deficiencies with reference to the NEERI report and suggest control measures to be taken by the petitioner.

The court order requires the implementation of measures to control emissions and improve treatment processes at an industry premises. This includes providing ducts to collect fugitive emissions, increasing water sprinkling on roads, and installing an iron removal plant for reverse osmosis systems. The order also mandates the expansion of the evaporation system and the removal of temporary storage ponds for disposal of reverse osmosis rejects. Additionally, raw materials are to be stored in a closed shed and chemical storage tanks are to be provided with dykes. The order also requires the removal of deposited silt in storm water drains.

The court order outlines several measures to improve environmental safety and prevent pollution in an industrial plant. These measures include removing silt from storm water drains, providing additional rainwater collection reservoirs, storing slag waste in a restricted area and disposing of it for beneficial uses, monitoring air quality and water consumption, regularly monitoring fluoride concentration in groundwater, and developing greenbelt areas within the plant premises. The order also requires health monitoring of nearby residents and adherence to safe load bearing capacity for storing slag waste.

The court has ordered a plant, slag yard, gypsum pond, and secured landfill facility to act as a barrier to control secondary fugitive emissions. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has been directed to issue directions to the petitioners-industry to carry out the necessary measures and remove deficiencies within a reasonable time. The matter will be listed in the first week of January 2012, and the interim stay of the impugned judgment will continue until then. Additionally, the court has specified that certain native species should be planted in new areas of greenbelt cover.

Overall, the court order aims to improve environmental safety and prevent pollution in an industrial plant. The order mandates the implementation of several measures to control emissions and improve treatment processes, including the installation of ducts to collect fugitive emissions, the expansion of the evaporation system, and the removal of temporary storage ponds for disposal of reverse osmosis rejects. The order also requires the removal of deposited silt in storm water drains, the provision of additional rainwater collection reservoirs, and the development of greenbelt areas within the plant premises.

In addition to these measures, the court order mandates the storage of slag waste in a restricted area and its disposal for beneficial uses, the monitoring of air quality and water consumption, and the regular monitoring of fluoride concentration in groundwater. The order also requires health monitoring of nearby residents and adherence to safe load bearing capacity for storing slag waste.

To control secondary fugitive emissions, the court has ordered the establishment of a plant, slag yard, gypsum pond, and secured landfill facility. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has been directed to issue directions to the petitioners-industry to carry out the necessary measures and remove deficiencies within a reasonable time. The court has also specified that certain native species should be planted in new areas of greenbelt cover.

In conclusion, the court order is a significant step towards improving environmental safety and preventing pollution in an industrial plant. The order mandates the implementation of several measures to control emissions and improve treatment processes, as well as the establishment of facilities to control secondary fugitive emissions. The order also requires the monitoring of air quality and water consumption, the regular monitoring of fluoride concentration in groundwater, and the development of greenbelt areas within the plant premises. Overall, the court order is a positive development in the fight against environmental pollution and sets an important precedent for future cases.
