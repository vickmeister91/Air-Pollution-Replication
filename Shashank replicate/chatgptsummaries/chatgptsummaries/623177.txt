The court order in question pertains to a case where the deceased had gifted various properties to his grandchildren and one other person. The Assistant Controller had included the value of the gifted lands in the principal value of the estate of the deceased, as he believed that the deceased had not been entirely excluded from benefit, possession, and enjoyment of the properties gifted. The Appellate Controller had rejected the contentions of the assessees, and the Tribunal had held that the donees had been given possession of the lands gifted to them and the deceased had not been excluded from the properties. The Tribunal had also held that the inclusion of the value of the lineal descendant's share in the ancestral property was not correct. The court upheld the decision of the Tribunal and answered the questions referred to it in the negative and in favor of the assessees.
