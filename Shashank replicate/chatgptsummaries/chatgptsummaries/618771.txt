The Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC) was entrusted with the task of developing land in the Narela township for an industrial complex. The DSIDC invited applications from the public for allotment of plots for setting up industries in the complex. The petitioners obtained application forms and paid the requisite fee. The DSIDC assured the petitioners that immediate steps were being taken to develop the land and as soon as the land was developed, possession of plots would be handed over to the respective entrepreneurs. However, the DSIDC later issued a new scheme for allotment of plots, reducing the sizes of the plots and equating the petitioners with new applicants. The petitioners claimed that the DSIDC made a categorical representation in the advertisement dated 23rd December 1976 and the petitioners acting on that representation, altered their position and the DSIDC is, therefore, stopped from going back on this representation. The petitioners relied on the doctrine of promissory estoppel in support of their case.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the allotment of plots in the Narela Township Industrial Complex. The Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC) issued tentative offers for plots in 1977, and the petitioners and others applied for them. However, due to various problems, the 1977 scheme was abandoned, and a new scheme was introduced in 1987. The petitioners argue that they are entitled to the plots they applied for in 1977, while the DSIDC argues that the new scheme is the one that should be enforced. The court examines the evidence and finds that the petitioners were aware that the policy regarding allotment of plots was yet to be finalised, and that the new scheme is more beneficial to the public at large. The court dismisses the writ petitions.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioners claimed that they were promised industrial plots in 1977 by the Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC), and that the DSIDC was now going back on its promise. The petitioners argued that the doctrine of promissory estoppel should be applied to enforce the promise. However, the court found that the 1977 policy was tentative and no promises or assurances were held out, and that the petitioners had accepted the final policy announced in 1987 and taken benefits under it. The court also found that the re-adjustment of plot sizes and increase in price of land in the 1987 policy was justified and in public interest, and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel was not applicable in this case.

The court order discusses the development of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in India, which allows a party to enforce a promise made by another party even if it was not recorded in a formal contract. The court cites several landmark cases, including Union of India v. Anglo Afghan Agencies and M.P. Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., which established the principles of promissory estoppel and its application in cases where a party has relied on a promise to their detriment. The court also notes that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an equitable principle and may be displaced if it would be inequitable to hold the government to the promise made.

The court order discusses the application of promissory estoppel in cases involving the government's exercise of its powers for the public good. The court cites various cases where the doctrine of promissory estoppel was applied or not applied, depending on the circumstances. The court concludes that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to compel the government to carry out a representation or promise that is contrary to law or outside its authority. The court also notes that the government is entitled to change its policy from time to time according to the demands of the time and situation.

The court order pertains to the case of State of U.P. v. Vijay Bahadur Singh, where the government cancelled an auction after provisionally accepting the highest bid due to suspicions of fraudulent bidding. The Supreme Court upheld the government's decision, stating that the government is entitled to change its policy in the public interest. The court also ruled that the principle of promissory estoppel does not apply in this case. The writ petitions were dismissed, and the parties were left to bear their respective costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in cases involving the government's exercise of its powers for the public good. The court found that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to compel the government to carry out a representation or promise that is contrary to law or outside its authority. The court also noted that the government is entitled to change its policy from time to time according to the demands of the time and situation. In the specific case of the Narela Township Industrial Complex, the court found that the petitioners were aware that the policy regarding allotment of plots was yet to be finalised, and that the new scheme is more beneficial to the public at large. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petitions.
