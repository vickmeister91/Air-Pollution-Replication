The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner has sought to set aside two orders passed by the District and Sessions Judge and the Principal JMFC in a case related to maintaining accounts. The court has ordered the respondent to produce the accounts that were summoned under section 91 of Cr.P.C. as the petitioner has established that the respondent has not maintained the accounts. The court has also noted that there is no prima facie proof regarding the existence of the accounts and the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked at this stage.

The petitioner in this case has approached the court seeking relief from two orders passed by the District and Sessions Judge and the Principal JMFC. The case pertains to maintaining accounts, and the petitioner has alleged that the respondent has not maintained the accounts as required by law. The petitioner has sought to set aside the orders passed by the lower courts and has requested the court to direct the respondent to produce the accounts that were summoned under section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The court has considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner and has noted that the respondent has not maintained the accounts as required by law. The court has also observed that there is no prima facie proof regarding the existence of the accounts. In light of these observations, the court has ordered the respondent to produce the accounts that were summoned under section 91 of Cr.P.C.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to a person to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner in this case has established that the respondent has not maintained the accounts as required by law, and therefore, the court has ordered the respondent to produce the accounts that were summoned under section 91 of Cr.P.C.

However, the court has also noted that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked at this stage as there is no prima facie proof regarding the existence of the accounts. This means that the court has not yet established the existence of the accounts, and therefore, the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked at this stage.
