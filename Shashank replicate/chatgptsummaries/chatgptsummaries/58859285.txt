The court case involves a dispute between Sh. Kishori Lal and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi over the demolition of three rolling shutters installed by the plaintiff to protect his property in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. The plaintiff had applied for a sanction plan to reconstruct the building, which was granted. However, the defendants later demolished the shutters, causing the plaintiff a loss of about Rs. 2 lakhs. The plaintiff sued the defendants for damages of Rs. 6 lakhs along with interest, claiming that the action of the defendants was illegal.

The court order discusses various issues related to the case, including whether the suit is barred under certain sections of the DMC Act, whether the court has jurisdiction, and whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages. The plaintiff presents evidence, including witness testimony and documents, to support their case, while the defendant argues that the suit is not maintainable and that the demolition was carried out in accordance with the law.

The court considers all the evidence and arguments presented and makes a decision on the case. The court finds that the plaintiff has been able to prove that notice was duly served prior to filing the suit. The court also cites various sections of the DMC Act related to the demolition and stoppage of buildings and works in certain cases and the right to appeal against such orders. The plaintiff's case is that the building was reconstructed in accordance with the sanctioned plan and shutters were constructed only to protect the suit premises. The report of a local commissioner is also mentioned.

However, the court finds that the plaintiff did not have a sanctioned plan for the construction of shops and shutters, and the demolition carried out by the defendant was not a jurisdictional error. The court also rules that the suit is barred under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and the Specific Relief Act, and dismisses the suit with costs. The plaintiff is not entitled to damages.

The court order was announced on October 6, 2009, by an Additional District Judge in Delhi's Central District. However, no information is provided about the content of the order.
