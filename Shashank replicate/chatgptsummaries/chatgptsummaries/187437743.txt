The court order pertains to two petitions filed by M/S Data Enterprises and BEDY Association, who imported old and used LCD monitors, desktop computers, and cooler fans to India without obtaining permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The Ministry denied permission, citing the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, which regulate the import of hazardous waste. The petitioners argued that they were not aware of the requirement for permission at the time of import and that the denial of permission was unjustified. The court examined the relevant rules and regulations and concluded that the Ministry was within its rights to deny permission and that the petitioners had not met the necessary conditions for import.

The court order discusses a case where the Delhi Pollution Control Board's comments were not considered, and permission was refused to import used computers and computer peripherals. The court determines that permission for import under the Hazardous Wastes Rules has to be obtained before bringing the goods into India. The court also states that the MoEF has the power to decline permission for the import of hazardous wastes intended for reuse, even if the goods are intended for reuse. The court further determines that the MoEF is entitled to take a policy decision not to entertain applications for import of any particular category of hazardous goods.

The court order states that hazardous waste is dangerous to humanity and cannot be dealt with by anyone. While certain categories of hazardous waste may be necessary for commercial, economic, and political reasons, import is only allowed with permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and is limited to recycling, recovery, or reuse. The court emphasizes that the government has the power to decide not to permit the import of hazardous waste if it deems it necessary for the safety of the country. The court also notes that it is not for the courts to determine the fairness or reasonableness of a policy decision, but rather to ensure that the decision was made without procedural impropriety and is not arbitrary or unconstitutional.

The court order deals with three separate cases where the import of hazardous waste was denied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. In the first case, M/S Data Enterprises and BEDY Association imported old and used LCD monitors, desktop computers, and cooler fans to India without obtaining permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The Ministry denied permission, citing the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, which regulate the import of hazardous waste. The petitioners argued that they were not aware of the requirement for permission at the time of import and that the denial of permission was unjustified. The court examined the relevant rules and regulations and concluded that the Ministry was within its rights to deny permission and that the petitioners had not met the necessary conditions for import.

In the second case, the Delhi Pollution Control Board's comments were not considered, and permission was refused to import used computers and computer peripherals. The court determines that permission for import under the Hazardous Wastes Rules has to be obtained before bringing the goods into India. The court also states that the MoEF has the power to decline permission for the import of hazardous wastes intended for reuse, even if the goods are intended for reuse. The court further determines that the MoEF is entitled to take a policy decision not to entertain applications for import of any particular category of hazardous goods.

In the third case, the court emphasizes that hazardous waste is dangerous to humanity and cannot be dealt with by anyone. While certain categories of hazardous waste may be necessary for commercial, economic, and political reasons, import is only allowed with permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and is limited to recycling, recovery, or reuse. The court emphasizes that the government has the power to decide not to permit the import of hazardous waste if it deems it necessary for the safety of the country. The court also notes that it is not for the courts to determine the fairness or reasonableness of a policy decision, but rather to ensure that the decision was made without procedural impropriety and is not arbitrary or unconstitutional.

In all three cases, the court emphasizes the importance of obtaining permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests before importing hazardous waste into India. The court notes that the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, regulate the import of hazardous waste and that the Ministry of Environment and Forests has the power to decline permission for the import of hazardous wastes intended for reuse, even if the goods are intended for reuse. The court also notes that the government has the power to decide not to permit the import of hazardous waste if it deems it necessary for the safety of the country.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of following the rules and regulations set forth by the Ministry of Environment and Forests when importing hazardous waste into India. The court emphasizes that hazardous waste is dangerous to humanity and cannot be dealt with by anyone. While certain categories of hazardous waste may be necessary for commercial, economic, and political reasons, import is only allowed with permission from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and is limited to recycling, recovery, or reuse. The court's decision also underscores the importance of obtaining permission before importing hazardous waste into India and the power of the MoEF to decline permission for the import of hazardous wastes intended for reuse, even if the goods are intended for reuse.
