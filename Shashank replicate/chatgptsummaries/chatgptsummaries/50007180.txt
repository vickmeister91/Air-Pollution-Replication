In a recent court order, the petitioners' lands were declared as Kudremukha National Park, but they had not received compensation for it. The court directed the respondent No.3 to pass the award and disburse the compensation amount to the petitioners within three months. The petitioners were also advised to seek enhancement of the market value if they were not satisfied with the determination of the amounts in the Deputy Commissioner's award. No costs were awarded.

The case pertains to the declaration of the petitioners' lands as Kudremukha National Park. The petitioners had not received compensation for the land that was taken over by the government for the purpose of creating the national park. The court order directed the respondent No.3 to pass the award and disburse the compensation amount to the petitioners within three months.

The court also advised the petitioners to seek enhancement of the market value if they were not satisfied with the determination of the amounts in the Deputy Commissioner's award. This means that if the petitioners feel that the compensation amount awarded to them is not sufficient, they can approach the court to seek a higher amount.

It is important to note that no costs were awarded in this case. This means that the petitioners will not be reimbursed for any legal expenses incurred during the course of the case. However, the fact that they have been awarded compensation for their land is a significant victory for them.

The court order is significant because it upholds the rights of landowners who have had their land taken over by the government for the purpose of creating national parks. It is important for the government to ensure that landowners are adequately compensated for their loss, and this court order sets a precedent for future cases.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the petitioners, who have been fighting for compensation for their land for a long time. The fact that they have been awarded compensation within a specific timeframe is a significant victory for them. However, it is important for the government to ensure that landowners are adequately compensated for their loss in all cases, and not just in cases where there is a court order directing them to do so.
