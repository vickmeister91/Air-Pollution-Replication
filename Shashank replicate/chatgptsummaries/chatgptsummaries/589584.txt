The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by C.A. Tanuja against the Mandya Rural Police. Tanuja was accused number three in a case registered for an offense punishable under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, it was later found that the offense was punishable under Section 332 r/w Section 201 of IPC. Tanuja was the wife of accused number two and had conspired with him to do away with her husband. She had given false information to the police but later revealed the incident voluntarily.

The court dismissed Tanuja's petition, considering the offense to be punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of IPC. This decision was based on the fact that Tanuja had conspired with her husband to commit murder, which falls under Section 302 of IPC. Additionally, she had given false information to the police, which is punishable under Section 201 of IPC.

The case began when Tanuja's husband was found dead under suspicious circumstances. The police initially registered a case under Section 304A of IPC, which deals with causing death by negligence. However, during the investigation, it was revealed that Tanuja had conspired with her husband to kill him. She had given him poison, and when he fell unconscious, she had strangled him to death.

Tanuja had initially given false information to the police, claiming that her husband had died due to a heart attack. However, she later revealed the truth voluntarily. The police then registered a case under Section 302 of IPC, which deals with murder, and Section 201 of IPC, which deals with causing disappearance of evidence.

Tanuja filed a criminal petition in the court, challenging the registration of the case under Section 302 of IPC. She argued that the offense was punishable under Section 304A of IPC, and therefore, the case should be registered under that section. However, the court dismissed her petition, stating that the offense was punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of IPC.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Tanuja had conspired with her husband to commit murder, which falls under Section 302 of IPC. Additionally, she had given false information to the police, which is punishable under Section 201 of IPC. The court held that the offense was not merely causing death by negligence, as initially thought, but a premeditated murder.
