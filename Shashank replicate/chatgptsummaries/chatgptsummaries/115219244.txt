The court order pertains to a civil application made in a disposed of PIL by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, which reveals the shocking state of affairs in Mumbai. The city generates 60-70% of municipal solid waste every day, which is being illegally dumped in the city itself by the Municipal Corporation. The Corporation has only one proper facility in the city at Kanjur, which has a processing capacity of 3000 MT of solid waste per day. The dumping is made at the sites at Deonar and Mulund, which were required to be closed down long back as they are not in conformity with the requirements of the MSW Rules. The court notes that there is no possibility that in the near future, the Municipal Corporation of the commercial capital of the country will be able to comply with the mandatory requirements of MSW Rules.

The court order states that the Corporation of the commercial capital of the country needs to comply with the mandatory requirements of MSW Rules. The recent incidents of fire at Deonar Dumping ground where illegal dumping is being made has caused citizens in the locality to suffer from respiratory diseases and increased pollution levels in the city. The court had previously ordered the closure of dumping sites that do not comply with MSW Rules, but the time limit has expired. The Corporation has filed an application to continue dumping waste at Mulund and Deonar until new processing facilities are set up. The court notes that it is impossible for the Corporation to provide facilities to deal with the entire quantity of solid waste generated every day in the city of Mumbai.

The court order states that a corporation and the state government cannot be granted an extension of time to deal with solid waste management due to the large scale development in the city and the increasing population. The court must ensure that the provisions of the Environment Protection Act and the MSW Rules are implemented to guarantee citizens' fundamental right to live in a pollution-free environment. The MSW Rules define municipal solid waste as commercial and residential waste in solid or semi-solid form, excluding industrial hazardous waste but including treated bio-medical waste and debris from the demolition and construction of buildings and structures. The court must grant an extension of time for a limited period subject to compliance with various terms and conditions to ensure that the quantity of municipal solid waste does not increase substantially.

The court order discusses the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Rules and the responsibilities of municipal authorities and state governments in managing and disposing of municipal solid waste. The MSW Rules require the implementation of infrastructure for collection, storage, segregation, transportation, processing, and disposal of municipal solid waste. The court order also includes a schedule for compliance with the MSW Rules, which includes setting up solid waste processing and disposal facilities by December 31, 2003. The order was issued in response to PILs and writ petitions filed against the failure of municipal authorities and state governments to comply with the MSW Rules. The order includes clauses outlining the responsibilities of local authorities without landfill sites or dumping grounds.

The court order requires local authorities to acquire designated sites for landfill or dumping within two weeks, either through land acquisition or mutual agreement with landowners. The selection of sites must consider environmental laws and regulations. Local authorities with approved sites must make them operational within four weeks. The Pollution Control Board must grant authorization within two weeks of receiving an application. The State Government must assist local authorities in identifying and acquiring sites if none are designated. Dumping sites that do not comply with regulations must be closed within three months. Local authorities must also take steps for waste treatment and elimination of landfilling requirements. Sites for composting and vermi composting must comply with regulations and have a cap on storage of wet garbage.

The court order requires certain sites to comply with rules for storage of garbage and limit the storage of wet garbage. If there is non-compliance, the site will be closed down until remedial measures are taken. An action plan for treatment and processing of solid waste is also outlined, including the development of a mechanism for collection and transportation to processing facilities and landfill sites. The Mulund dumping ground will be closed down in a scientific manner, and steps will be taken to improve the Deonar dumping ground. Affidavits filed by officials provide details on the history of the dumping grounds and the steps being taken to comply with the court order.

The court order discusses the proposed use of the Deonar dumping ground for a Waste to Energy Plant, as well as other sites for waste processing plants. The order notes that even with these facilities, the city of Mumbai will not be able to fully comply with MSW Rules for dealing with municipal solid waste. The State Government has expressed inability to impose restrictions on construction activities, which may contribute to the waste problem. The order calls for a scientific assessment of the impact of construction on waste generation.

The court order discusses a circular issued by the government to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) regarding waste management. The circular includes directions to segregate bio-degradable waste, process it in a decentralized manner, and give permission for processing bio-degradable waste within plot areas. However, the court notes that the circular is ineffective without modifications to the Development Control Regulations (DCR) and that there are no concrete measures to prevent the generation of more municipal solid waste. The court grants an extension of time for the MCGM and the State Government to act, but imposes conditions to prevent complacency.

The court has granted a limited extension until June
