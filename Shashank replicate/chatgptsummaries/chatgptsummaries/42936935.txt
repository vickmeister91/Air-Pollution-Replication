The two court orders pertain to eviction petitions filed under sections 14(1)(a) and (k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. In the first case, J.S. Mehta filed a petition claiming ownership of property no. 32, Block No. 3, Old Rajinder Nagar, New Delhi, and seeking eviction of the tenant, Sh. Jagmohan @ Raju, who was allegedly using the premises for commercial purposes in violation of the lease agreement. The court heard arguments from both parties and examined evidence presented by them. The court found that the petitioner had established the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship, arrears of rent, and service of notice of demand, and therefore granted the eviction order.

In the second case, the petitioner claimed to be the exclusive owner of the property and landlord of the tenant, but failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his claim. The petitioner also alleged that the tenant was using the property for commercial purposes in contravention of government regulations, but again failed to provide any evidence to support this claim. The court dismissed the eviction petition, stating that the petitioner had failed to establish any relationship of landlord-tenant between him and the respondent, and that there was no evidence to support the claim of commercial use of the property.

The Delhi Rent Control Act was enacted in 1958 to regulate the rents of residential and commercial properties in Delhi. The Act provides for the regulation of rents, repairs, and maintenance of residential and commercial properties, and the prevention of unauthorized occupation of such properties. The Act also provides for the eviction of tenants in certain circumstances, such as non-payment of rent, subletting of the property, and use of the property for commercial purposes in contravention of the lease agreement.

Section 14 of the Act deals with the eviction of tenants. Section 14(1)(a) provides for eviction if the tenant has not paid rent for a period of six months or more. Section 14(1)(k) provides for eviction if the tenant has used the property for a purpose other than that for which it was leased, without the consent of the landlord.

In the first case, J.S. Mehta claimed ownership of the property and sought eviction of the tenant for using the property for commercial purposes in violation of the lease agreement. The court found that the petitioner had established the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship, arrears of rent, and service of notice of demand, and therefore granted the eviction order under section 14 (1) (a) and (k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act.

In the second case, the petitioner claimed to be the exclusive owner of the property and landlord of the tenant, but failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his claim. The petitioner also alleged that the tenant was using the property for commercial purposes in contravention of government regulations, but again failed to provide any evidence to support this claim. The court dismissed the eviction petition, stating that the petitioner had failed to establish any relationship of landlord-tenant between him and the respondent, and that there was no evidence to support the claim of commercial use of the property.

The two court orders highlight the importance of establishing a landlord-tenant relationship and providing evidence to support claims of non-payment of rent or unauthorized use of the property. Landlords must ensure that they have proper documentation to prove their ownership of the property and the terms of the lease agreement. Tenants must also ensure that they comply with the terms of the lease agreement and do not use the property for purposes other than those specified in the agreement.

In conclusion, the Delhi Rent Control Act provides for the regulation of rents, repairs, and maintenance of residential and commercial properties, and the prevention of unauthorized occupation of such properties. The Act also provides for the eviction of tenants in certain circumstances, such as non-payment of rent, subletting of the property, and use of the property for commercial purposes in contravention of the lease agreement. The two court orders discussed above highlight the importance of establishing a landlord-tenant relationship and providing evidence to support claims of non-payment of rent or unauthorized use of the property.
