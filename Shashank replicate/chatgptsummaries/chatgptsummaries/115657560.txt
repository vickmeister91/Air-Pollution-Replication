The Telangana High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of writ petitions challenging the validity of the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of Teachers) Rules, 2018. The petitioners were teachers working in government schools or schools under the control of local bodies, and they were aggrieved by the action of the State Government in effecting transfers and prescribing the Rules for effecting transfers of Headmasters, teachers, etc.

The court examined the scope of judicial review in matters relating to transfers and concluded that the transfer of an employee, appointed to a class or category of transferable posts, from one place to another, is an incident of service necessary in public interest and efficiency in public administration. The court also noted that unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafides or is made in violation of any operative guidelines or Rules, Courts should not interfere with it.

The court order stated that unless a transfer order is made in violation of guidelines or rules, or is a result of malafide exercise of power, courts should not interfere with it. Government servants or employees of local bodies have no legal right to insist on being posted at a particular place. Transfer orders are a normal incidence of service and personal difficulties are matters for consideration of the department and not the court. The court should not substitute its own decision for that of the competent authorities. The order also discussed the 2018 Rules and their applicability to certain categories of employees in Telangana. The court rejected the argument that the Rules violate the status quo order passed in a previous case.

The court order stated that the State Government is entitled to transfer management-wise without integrating them and without disturbing their seniority and promotions. The court had passed an interim order of status-quo in 2017, which disabled the State Government from integrating teachers in Government Schools and local body schools. The court order also clarified that the 2018 Rules do not violate the status-quo order. The amendment made to the Presidential Order in 2017 has not ceased to remain in force due to the order of status-quo passed by the court. The court order also explained the history of the case and the various judgments passed by the court and the Supreme Court.

The court order stated that even when an order is suspended, it still exists and has operation in other respects except where it has been suspended. The order of status quo passed by the court would not result in wiping out the 2017 amendment to the Presidential Order from existence, but only disables the government from implementing it. The court also discussed whether the transfer of teachers working in local body schools falls within the ambit of the Presidential Order and concluded that the order only requires a local cadre to be organized for civil posts in departments of the State Government, not for posts under a local authority. Therefore, teachers in government schools were organized into local cadres in each district, but teachers in schools under local authorities were not.

The court order discussed the application of the 1975 Presidential Order on the transfer of teachers in Government and local body schools in the State of Telangana. It stated that the unit of appointment, transfer, seniority, promotion, etc. for teachers in Government schools can only be within the erstwhile 10 districts of the state, as recognized by the Presidential Order. The creation of 31 districts in 2016 does not affect this. The order also clarified that the Presidential Order only applies to direct recruitment of teachers in local body schools, and not to their transfer. The 2018 Rules for transfer of teachers fall in line with the Presidential Order and do not violate the law declared in previous court judgments. However, the State Government needs to take necessary remedial measures for promotions and seniority of teachers in local body schools.

The court order pertained to the transfer, seniority, and promotion of teachers in local body schools in the state of Telangana. The court upheld the state government's decision to prescribe the erstwhile ten districts as a unit for transfer, despite the fact that these districts no longer exist following the formation of 31 revenue districts in 2016. The court ruled that this decision is not irrational and does not violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court also stated that the burden of proof lies with the party attacking the categorization to show that it is unreasonable and violates the Constitution.

The court order stated that the burden of proof lies on the party attacking the categorization to show that it is unreasonable and violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The government's action is presumed to be reasonable and in the public interest, and it is up to the challenging party to prove otherwise. The court cannot assume that the government's action is unreasonable without proper evidence. The court also discussed the requirement of laying rules before both houses of the legislature and concluded that non-compliance with this requirement does not affect the validity of the rules. The rules are valid from the date they are made, and non-compliance with the laying clause is not mandatory.

The court order stated that the omission to comply with the requirement of laying the Rules before the State Legislature would not affect the validity of the Rules and their coming into force. The laying of the Rules before the legislature is merely directory, and not mandatory. The court also dismissed the contention that Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules is a colourable legislation. The intent behind the prescription of the ten Districts as a unit of
