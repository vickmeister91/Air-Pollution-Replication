The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab recently heard a complaint filed by Atul Dhanda against The Sherwood Officers Society and others. Dhanda had booked a residential plot in the society's project, but the possession was not handed over within the stipulated time. The society had decided to hand over the project to RKM Housing Ltd., which issued a revised allotment letter to Dhanda. The complainant sought a refund of Rs. 27,81,000/- along with interest, compensation towards mental harassment, litigation expenses, and counsel fee.

The commission allowed both parties to lead their respective evidence. The society denied any deficiency in service and argued that the complaint was without merit. Opposite party No.4 did not file a written reply within the stipulated period. After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the commission found that the society had failed to deliver possession of the plot to the complainant within the stipulated time. The commission also noted that the society had failed to provide any valid reason for the delay in handing over possession.

The commission further observed that the society had decided to hand over the project to RKM Housing Ltd., which had issued a revised allotment letter to the complainant. However, the commission found that the revised allotment letter did not mention the date of possession, which was a crucial piece of information for the complainant. The commission also noted that the society had failed to provide any valid reason for not mentioning the date of possession in the revised allotment letter.

The commission held that the society had committed a deficiency in service by failing to deliver possession of the plot to the complainant within the stipulated time and by not providing the date of possession in the revised allotment letter. The commission ordered the society to refund the complainant's amount of Rs. 27,81,000/- with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of deposit till the date of realization. The commission also ordered the society to pay compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- towards mental harassment, Rs. 50,000/- towards litigation expenses, and Rs. 10,000/- towards counsel fee.

In another court order, a complaint was filed against a housing project called Sherwood Estates and the failure of the developers to deliver possession of the plots to the allottees. The court considered an application by the developers to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Consumer Fora does not have jurisdiction over disputes between a society and its members. The court rejected this argument, citing provisions under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and previous judgments.

The court then reviewed the facts of the case, including the payment made by the complainant and the failure of the developers to deliver possession of the plot. The court also noted a memorandum of understanding signed between the developers and another party, and a revised allotment letter issued to the complainant. The court also considered a letter from GMADA alleging violations of the PAPRA Act, 1995.

After considering all the evidence presented by both parties, the court found that the developers had failed to deliver possession of the plot to the complainant within the stipulated time and without obtaining necessary permissions from concerned authorities. The court held that the developers had committed unfair trade practices and deficiency in service. The court ordered the developers to refund the complainant's amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment, and litigation costs.

In yet another court order, a complaint was filed under the PAPRA, 1995, regarding a real estate project that was not completed within the stipulated time and without obtaining necessary permissions from concerned authorities. The court found the opposite parties guilty of unfair trade practices and deficiency in service and ordered them to refund the complainant's amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment, and litigation costs.

The court noted that the complaint could not be decided within the statutory period due to heavy pendency of court cases. The court observed that the opposite parties had failed to obtain necessary permissions from concerned authorities and had not completed the project within the stipulated time. The court held that the opposite parties had committed unfair trade practices and deficiency in service.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of timely possession of properties and obtaining necessary permissions from concerned authorities. The courts have held that failure to deliver possession of properties within the stipulated time and without obtaining necessary permissions from concerned authorities constitutes deficiency in service and unfair trade practices. The courts have ordered developers to refund the complainant's amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment, and litigation costs. These court orders serve as a warning to developers to ensure timely possession of properties and obtain necessary permissions from concerned authorities to avoid legal action.
