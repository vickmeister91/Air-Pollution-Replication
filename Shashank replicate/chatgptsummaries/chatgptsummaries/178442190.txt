The High Court of Kerala recently passed a court order in a criminal revision petition filed by three accused persons who were charged with offences under the Kerala Forest Act and the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The trial court had convicted them under the Kerala Forest Act and acquitted them under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The conviction was confirmed by the lower appellate court, and the accused persons filed a revision petition before the High Court.

The High Court examined the evidence and found no legal reason to hold that the conviction was not in accordance with the law. The court observed that the accused persons had trespassed into the forest area and had cut down trees without obtaining the necessary permission from the authorities. The court also noted that the accused persons had not produced any evidence to show that they had obtained the necessary permission.

The court further observed that the accused persons had caused damage to the forest area and had violated the provisions of the Kerala Forest Act. The court held that the conviction under the Kerala Forest Act was justified and in accordance with the law.

However, the court showed leniency in the imprisonment part of the sentence due to the prolonged litigation and the age of the accused persons. The court reduced the sentence of imprisonment from six months to three months. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 on each of the accused persons.

The court order is significant as it upholds the importance of protecting the forest area and the environment. The court has sent a strong message that violations of the law will not be tolerated and that the offenders will be punished. The court has also shown that it is willing to consider mitigating factors such as the age of the accused persons and the prolonged litigation while deciding on the sentence.

The court order is also a reminder to the public that it is their responsibility to protect the environment and to comply with the laws and regulations governing the use of natural resources. The court has emphasized that the protection of the environment is a collective responsibility and that everyone must do their part to ensure that the environment is preserved for future generations.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the High Court of Kerala in the criminal revision petition filed by three accused persons is a significant step towards protecting the environment and upholding the rule of law. The court has sent a strong message that violations of the law will not be tolerated and that the offenders will be punished. The court has also shown that it is willing to consider mitigating factors while deciding on the sentence. The court order is a reminder to the public that it is their responsibility to protect the environment and to comply with the laws and regulations governing the use of natural resources.
