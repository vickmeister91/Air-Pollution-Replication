The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner, Ramdoss, had requested the court to set aside an order made in Crl.M.P.No.3530 of 2014 in C.C.No.12/11 on the file of I Additional Munsif Court cum Judicial Magistrate No.1, Ulundurpet. The order allowed the complainant to summon bank managers for the purpose of giving evidence in a case related to offences under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.

The petitioner argued that the order was not maintainable as the complainant had not cited these witnesses in the complaint. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the evidence of the bank managers was essential and the order of the trial court did not suffer from any serious infirmity.

The case in question relates to offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques. The complainant had alleged that the accused had issued a cheque for a certain amount, which was dishonoured by the bank on the grounds of insufficient funds. The complainant had then sent a notice to the accused, demanding payment of the amount due. However, the accused had failed to make the payment, leading to the filing of the complaint.

During the course of the trial, the complainant had sought to summon bank managers as witnesses to prove that the cheque in question had been dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The petitioner had objected to this, stating that the complainant had not cited these witnesses in the complaint and that their evidence was therefore not admissible.

The trial court had allowed the complainant's request and had issued summons to the bank managers. The petitioner had then filed the present petition, seeking to set aside this order.

The court, however, held that the evidence of the bank managers was essential to the case and that the trial court had not committed any serious infirmity in allowing their summons. The court noted that the complainant had already produced the dishonoured cheque as evidence and that the evidence of the bank managers would only serve to corroborate this evidence.

The court also observed that the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were aimed at promoting the efficacy of banking operations and that the evidence of bank officials was therefore crucial to the adjudication of cases under this section.

In light of these considerations, the court dismissed the petition and upheld the order of the trial court allowing the complainant to summon bank managers as witnesses.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order allowing the complainant to summon bank managers as witnesses in a case related to offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court, however, dismissed the petition, holding that the evidence of the bank managers was essential to the case and that the trial court had not committed any serious infirmity in allowing their summons. The court also observed that the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were aimed at promoting the efficacy of banking operations and that the evidence of bank officials was therefore crucial to the adjudication of cases under this section.
