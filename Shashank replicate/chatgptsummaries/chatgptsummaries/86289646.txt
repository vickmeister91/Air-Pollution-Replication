The court received an application challenging an order passed by the 3rd A.D.J. in a criminal case. The order directed that the petitioner's application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. shall be considered after examination of the I.O. The petitioner had filed the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking the production of certain documents and materials from the police. The petitioner's counsel argued that the documents and materials were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial and that the I.O. had failed to produce them despite repeated requests.

During the hearing, the petitioner's counsel requested to withdraw the application with liberty to file an appropriate application before the trial court after production of the M.Os. for examination of the I.O. The court granted the liberty and disposed of the case as withdrawn. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to withdraw the application and file a fresh one before the trial court. The court also noted that the petitioner had been granted liberty to file an appropriate application after the production of the M.Os. for examination of the I.O.

The order passed by the 3rd A.D.J. had directed the examination of the I.O. before considering the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. This was done to ensure that the documents and materials sought by the petitioner were relevant and necessary for the proper conduct of the trial. The court's decision to grant the petitioner liberty to file a fresh application after the production of the M.Os. for examination of the I.O. was based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to seek the production of relevant documents and materials for the proper conduct of the trial.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to withdraw the application and file a fresh one before the trial court. This was done to ensure that the petitioner had the opportunity to seek the production of relevant documents and materials for the proper conduct of the trial. The court's decision to grant the petitioner liberty to file a fresh application after the production of the M.Os. for examination of the I.O. was also based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to seek the production of relevant documents and materials for the proper conduct of the trial.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant the petitioner liberty to file a fresh application after the production of the M.Os. for examination of the I.O. was based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to seek the production of relevant documents and materials for the proper conduct of the trial. The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had the right to withdraw the application and file a fresh one before the trial court.
