The court recently issued two orders related to the transfer of criminal cases from one court to another. In the first case, the applicants had filed an application for the transfer of a criminal case from the Special Judge in Daman to another court outside the Union Territory of Daman and Diu. The applicants argued that the trial court had kept their application for preserving call detail records pending, and they had to move another application to point out the delay. However, the court found that the trial court had acted promptly and allowed the application as soon as urgency was pointed out. The court also emphasized the importance of the court record and stated that it cannot be challenged before any other court except the one that maintains it. The court found no bias attitude of the trial court and dismissed the application for transfer.

In the second case, the court rejected an application for transfer of proceedings from one court to another. The court stated that hypersensitivity or minor grievances cannot be used as a reason to transfer proceedings from one court to another. The court cited previous cases where they were reluctant to grant transfer requests unless there were concrete reasons to do so. The current application for transfer was deemed to be without merit and was rejected.

The transfer of criminal cases from one court to another is a matter of great importance, and the court has laid down certain guidelines for the same. The court has emphasized that the transfer of cases should not be done lightly and should only be done in exceptional circumstances. The court has also stated that the transfer of cases should not be used as a tool to delay the proceedings or to gain an advantage in the case.
