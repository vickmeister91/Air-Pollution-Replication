The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently considered the constitutionality of the M.P. Krishik Pashu Parirakshan (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1991, which imposed a total ban on the slaughter of certain species of cattle. The court had to determine whether the ban was permissible under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to carry on any trade, business or profession of one's choice, and whether the law was saved by virtue of Article 19(6) of the Constitution. The court also considered whether the ban was in line with the law declared by the Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1958 SC 731.

The court ultimately held that a total ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks was not permissible if keeping them would be a burden on society and not in the public interest. The court also considered the potential economic and social benefits of utilizing cattle dung as fuel and manure. The court order discusses the importance of natural manure in agriculture and the negative effects of chemical fertilizers. It also highlights the usefulness of bulls and bullocks as living animals and the ban on their slaughter in the interest of social and environmental welfare.

The court cited Article 51A of the Indian Constitution, which imposes a duty on citizens to protect and improve the natural environment and have compassion for living creatures. The court ultimately upholds the ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks as valid and in line with the Constitution.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the various factors involved in the ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks. The court recognized the importance of protecting the natural environment and the need to promote sustainable agriculture practices. The court also recognized the usefulness of bulls and bullocks as living animals and the potential economic and social benefits of utilizing cattle dung as fuel and manure.

The court's decision was also based on a careful consideration of the constitutional rights of individuals and the need to balance these rights with the public interest. The court recognized that individuals have the right to carry on any trade, business or profession of their choice, but also recognized that this right is subject to reasonable restrictions in the public interest.

The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the importance of protecting the natural environment and promoting sustainable agriculture practices. It also recognizes the usefulness of bulls and bullocks as living animals and the potential economic and social benefits of utilizing cattle dung as fuel and manure. The court's decision strikes a balance between the constitutional rights of individuals and the public interest in protecting the natural environment and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards promoting sustainable agriculture practices and protecting the natural environment. It recognizes the importance of balancing the constitutional rights of individuals with the public interest in promoting sustainable agriculture practices and protecting the natural environment. The court's decision is a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the role of agriculture in promoting sustainable development and protecting the natural environment.
