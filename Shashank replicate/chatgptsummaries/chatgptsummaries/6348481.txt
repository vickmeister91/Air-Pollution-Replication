Vinod, who was arrested in connection with a wildlife protection case, has been granted bail by the court. This is his fourth bail application, and he has been in jail for over a year. The court has directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties, one of which should be a local surety. He must also comply with the conditions under Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C and remain present during the trial.

The case against Vinod pertains to the illegal trade of wildlife products. He was arrested by the forest department officials in a raid conducted in a village near the forest area. The officials found several animal parts, including skins, bones, and horns, in his possession. The items seized from him were identified as those of endangered species, and he was charged under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Vinod had applied for bail three times before, but his applications were rejected by the court. The prosecution had argued that he was a habitual offender and was likely to abscond if released on bail. However, Vinod's counsel had contended that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. They had also argued that he had been in jail for a long time, and his health was deteriorating.

The court, after considering the arguments of both sides, has granted bail to Vinod. The court has directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties, one of which should be a local surety. The court has also imposed certain conditions on him, which he must comply with. These conditions are under Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C and require him to remain present during the trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to Vinod has been welcomed by his family and friends. They have expressed their gratitude to the court and have said that they have full faith in the judiciary. Vinod's counsel has also welcomed the decision and has said that they will continue to fight for his innocence.

The case against Vinod is still ongoing, and he will have to appear in court for the trial. The court has directed him to comply with the conditions imposed on him and has warned him that any violation of these conditions could result in the cancellation of his bail.
