The court order in question pertains to a case where a decree was obtained against the 6th defendant, who subsequently passed away and was replaced by his minor son as the legal representative. The decree-holder then applied for attachment of certain properties, which was granted in the absence of the minor son. The son later applied to set aside the order, but the lower court dismissed the application. The question before the court was whether Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies to execution proceedings under Order 21 that fall within Section 47 of the Code.

The court held that Order 9, Rule 13 applies only to suits and not to execution proceedings, and therefore the minor son's petition was not maintainable. The court also noted that a new rule may be needed to address cases where a party may suffer hardship due to the non-applicability of Order 9 in execution proceedings.

To understand the court's decision, it is important to first understand the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code provides for the setting aside of a decree passed ex parte against a defendant who was not present in court at the time of the hearing. Order 21 of the Code deals with the execution of decrees and orders, and Section 47 of the Code provides for the determination of questions arising in execution proceedings.

In the present case, the minor son of the deceased defendant had applied to set aside the order for attachment of certain properties that had been granted in the absence of the minor. The lower court had dismissed the application on the grounds that Order 9, Rule 13 did not apply to execution proceedings under Order 21 that fall within Section 47 of the Code.

The court, in its decision, agreed with the lower court's interpretation of the law. The court held that Order 9, Rule 13 applies only to suits and not to execution proceedings. The court noted that the language of Order 9, Rule 13 is clear and unambiguous, and it applies only to cases where a decree has been passed against a defendant in a suit. The court further observed that the purpose of Order 9, Rule 13 is to provide relief to a defendant who was not present in court at the time of the hearing and who may have been unaware of the proceedings.

The court also noted that the provisions of Order 21 of the Code are distinct from those of Order 9, and they deal with the execution of decrees and orders. The court observed that Section 47 of the Code provides for the determination of questions arising in execution proceedings, and it does not provide for the setting aside of a decree passed ex parte against a defendant.

The court, however, acknowledged that there may be cases where a party may suffer hardship due to the non-applicability of Order 9 in execution proceedings. The court noted that in such cases, a new rule may be needed to address the issue. The court observed that the legislature may consider amending the Code to provide for relief to parties who suffer hardship due to the non-applicability of Order 9 in execution proceedings.

In conclusion, the court held that Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code applies only to suits and not to execution proceedings under Order 21 that fall within Section 47 of the Code. The court also noted that a new rule may be needed to address cases where a party may suffer hardship due to the non-applicability of Order 9 in execution proceedings. The court's decision provides clarity on the scope and applicability of Order 9, Rule 13 in execution proceedings and highlights the need for legislative reform to address any gaps in the law.
