The Gujarat High Court has granted leave for an appeal by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board regarding a defective sanction under section 49 of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974. The trial court had relied upon this sanction as a ground for acquittal, which the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is now appealing against. The appeal has been admitted and the office has been directed to call for record and proceedings.

The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution in India. It provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control water pollution. Section 49 of the Act deals with the power of the pollution control board to grant sanction for prosecution.

In this case, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board had granted sanction for the prosecution of the accused under section 25 of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974. However, it was later discovered that the sanction was defective, as it did not comply with the requirements of section 49 of the Act. The trial court had relied upon this defect as a ground for acquittal, which the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is now appealing against.

The grant of leave for an appeal by the Gujarat High Court is an important development in this case. It indicates that the court is willing to consider the arguments put forward by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, and that there is a possibility that the acquittal may be overturned. The fact that the office has been directed to call for record and proceedings also suggests that the court is taking this matter seriously, and that it will examine the evidence and arguments presented by both sides before making a decision.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of complying with the requirements of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974, particularly with regard to the grant of sanction for prosecution. It also underscores the role of the courts in ensuring that the provisions of the Act are enforced, and that those who violate them are held accountable. As the case progresses, it will be interesting to see how the Gujarat High Court weighs the arguments put forward by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the accused, and what impact its decision will have on the enforcement of the Act in the future.
