The Delhi High Court recently issued an order in a writ petition challenging an order passed by the Appellate Authority. The order directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to decide an application afresh after inspecting the premises of respondent No. 2. The petitioner argued that the Master Plan only allows light and service industries, and the existing heavy and large industrial units should shift to Delhi Metropolitan Area. The court held that even an industry seeking a fresh start of another industrial activity on the existing plot and infrastructure is bound by the Master Plan and can only undertake light or service activity. The writ petition was allowed, and the impugned order was set aside.
