The Kerala High Court recently heard a case regarding the validity of a clause in the Kerala Minor Mineral Concessions Rules, 1957, which allowed permit holders to use mechanical devices for mining sand. The court declared the clause valid and within the state's power under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The court also stated that neighboring owners and the public are protected by strict conditions imposed on mining licenses. The court upheld the right of license holders to use mechanical devices as long as they do not violate the conditions of their license.

The court order states that the use of mechanical devices for mining is permitted as long as it is done in accordance with the terms and conditions of the license issued. The State Government has the power to grant the right to mine using mechanical devices, and Rule 8(1)(e) is only clarificatory in nature. The court also dismisses the idea that the use of mechanical devices for mining violates Article 21 of the Constitution of India, as mining is permitted with restrictions to protect the interests of the local public and neighboring owners.

The court also notes that the use of hi-tech machines in mining can save human lives and increase safety. The writ appeals and writ petition are allowed, upholding the validity of the impugned Rule and declaring the right to use mechanical devices for mining in terms of the licenses.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the state's power to regulate mining activities and the use of mechanical devices in the process. The court's ruling also highlights the importance of protecting the interests of the local public and neighboring owners, which can be achieved through strict conditions imposed on mining licenses.

The court's decision also recognizes the potential benefits of using hi-tech machines in mining, which can improve safety and save human lives. This is particularly important in a country like India, where mining accidents are not uncommon.

Overall, the court's decision is a balanced one, which takes into account the interests of all stakeholders involved in the mining process. It upholds the state's power to regulate mining activities and the use of mechanical devices, while also ensuring that the interests of the local public and neighboring owners are protected. The decision also recognizes the potential benefits of using hi-tech machines in mining, which can improve safety and save human lives.
