The case in question involves a petition filed by Panjab Singh under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Badi, District Dholpur. The order in question refused to release Singh's vehicle, Truck No.RJ11-GB-2441, which had been seized as case property in FIR No.282/2018. The FIR was registered at Police Station Basedi, District Dholpur for offences under Section 379 IPC, Sections 29/51, 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41, 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act.

Singh's petition was successful, and the court directed the trial court to release the vehicle seized as case property. However, this was subject to certain conditions being imposed. The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal provisions.

The court's decision to release the vehicle was based on the fact that it was not directly involved in the commission of the offences alleged in the FIR. The vehicle was merely used to transport the goods that were the subject of the alleged theft. As such, the court found that there was no reason to continue to hold the vehicle as case property.

However, the court also recognized the need to ensure that the interests of justice were served. To this end, the court imposed certain conditions on the release of the vehicle. These conditions included the requirement that Singh provide a surety bond of Rs. 1 lakh, and that he undertake to produce the vehicle before the trial court whenever required.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of careful consideration of the facts and legal provisions in any case. It also underscores the need to balance the interests of justice with the rights of individuals, particularly in cases where property is seized as case property.

Overall, the court's decision in this case represents a careful and considered approach to the issue of release of seized property. It demonstrates the court's commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served in all cases.
