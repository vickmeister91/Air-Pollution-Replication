The Karnataka High Court recently heard two petitions challenging the appointment of Sri K. Sudhakar as Member Secretary of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the curtailing of Dr. B. Shivalingaiah's appointment in his place. The court clubbed the petitions together and issued a common order. The petitioners alleged that Sudhakar's appointment was politically motivated and illegal, and that Shivalingaiah was more qualified for the position. The respondents denied these allegations and filed statements of objection. Ultimately, the court disposed of both petitions.

The court order discusses a case where the appointment of a Member Secretary of a Board is being challenged. The appointment was initially for a year and was extended by mistake for three years. The appointment was contractual, and the petitioner was not entitled to continue working until superannuation. The court found that the curtailment of the petitioner's appointment was legal and that the petitioner was entitled to a month's salary. The court also found that the posting of the current Member Secretary was not proper as he did not possess the required qualifications. The court also discussed whether an individual can maintain a Writ of Quo Warranto.

The court order states that the petitioner will receive one month's salary. The court also discusses the conditions for an individual to maintain a Writ of Quo Warranto, which is an exception to the general rule that one must show locus standi and public injury to seek a writ. The court determines that the petitioner's challenge to the appointment of Sudhakar is maintainable and that his appointment is prima facie contrary to the law. The court orders that Sudhakar's posting be withdrawn and that Dr. Shivalingaiah will continue as a Member Secretary until a suitable person is appointed, with one month's additional salary paid to him. The court rejects both writ petitions.

The court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioners alleging that Sudhakar's appointment was politically motivated and illegal, and that Shivalingaiah was more qualified for the position.
