In two separate court orders, two individuals, Imdad Ali and Rajender Kumar, were acquitted of charges related to the illegal use of a genset and theft. The first court order pertains to a case where the two individuals were charged with illegally boring with their genset, which was sealed by the SDM, Defence Colony, and removed without permission. The prosecution failed to prove its case, and both accused were acquitted. The court noted that while the machine was sealed, it was not established whether Imdad Ali had broken the seal and taken away the machine, and whether taking the machine amounted to theft.

The second court order pertains to FIR No. 587/2003 and states that the accused persons cannot be charged with theft as the prosecution failed to prove that they had dishonest intentions. The prosecution also failed to prove that the machine was being used for illegal boring. The accused persons are acquitted for the offences under section 379 IPC and section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

In both cases, the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. In the first case, the court noted that while the machine was sealed, it was not established whether Imdad Ali had broken the seal and taken away the machine, and whether taking the machine amounted to theft. In the second case, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused had dishonest intentions and that the machine was being used for illegal boring.

The court's decision to acquit the accused in both cases highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In criminal cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, and it is their responsibility to provide evidence that proves the guilt of the accused. If the prosecution fails to provide sufficient evidence, the accused cannot be convicted.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of following proper procedures when sealing and removing equipment. In the first case, the court noted that the machine was sealed by the SDM, Defence Colony, and removed without permission. This suggests that proper procedures were not followed, which may have contributed to the lack of evidence in the case.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and following proper procedures when sealing and removing equipment. Failure to do so can result in the acquittal of the accused, as was the case in these two instances.
