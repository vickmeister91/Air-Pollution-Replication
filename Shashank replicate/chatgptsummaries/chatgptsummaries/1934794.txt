The Kerala State Pollution Control Board had appointed the petitioners on a provisional basis as Assistant Engineers. However, the government had withdrawn permission to fill up the posts in the Board and allowed provisional appointments only in cases of compelling need. The petitioners sought direction to the Board to put into effect the rank list and declare it still in force. The court order pertains to this case.

The court quashed the government's direction and directed the Board to put in operation the rank list for a period of two years. The court also directed the Board to regularize the services of the rank holders already appointed during the period of validity of the rank list with effect from their date of joining service with all attendant service benefits.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the government's decision to withdraw permission to fill up the posts in the Board was arbitrary and without any basis. The court also noted that the petitioners had been appointed on a provisional basis only because of the government's decision to allow provisional appointments in cases of compelling need. Therefore, the court held that the petitioners were entitled to the benefits of the rank list and their services should be regularized.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of fairness and equity in employment. The court's decision ensures that the petitioners, who were appointed on a provisional basis, are not discriminated against and are given the same benefits as those who were appointed through the rank list. The court's decision also ensures that the rank list is given due importance and is not disregarded by the government or the Board.

The court's decision also has wider implications for the employment sector in India. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following due process in employment and ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and equitably. The court's decision also highlights the need for transparency in the recruitment process and the importance of adhering to the principles of merit and seniority.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a significant step towards ensuring fairness and equity in employment. The court's decision upholds the importance of the rank list and ensures that all employees are treated fairly and equitably. The court's decision also has wider implications for the employment sector in India and emphasizes the need for transparency and adherence to the principles of merit and seniority.
