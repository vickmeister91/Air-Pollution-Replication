The case in question involves a Criminal Revision application against the judgment passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Tirap District, Khonsa in case No. G.R. 10 of 1976. The accused had been convicted under Section 51(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and sentenced to simple imprisonment for 6 months. The accused had shot a tiger in self-defense while on sentry duty. The court found that the accused acted in defense of his life and his act did commensurate with defense. The court set aside the order of conviction and sentence as it was contrary to the provisions of Section 11 of the Act.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. Section 51(1) of the Act makes it an offense to hunt or kill any wild animal without a license or permit. The penalty for such an offense is imprisonment for a term of up to three years, or a fine of up to Rs. 25,000, or both.

In the present case, the accused had shot a tiger in self-defense while on sentry duty. The court found that the accused had acted in defense of his life and his act did commensurate with defense. The court noted that the accused had not gone out to hunt the tiger, but had encountered it while on duty. The court also noted that the accused had not used excessive force and had only fired one shot at the tiger. The court found that the accused had acted in good faith and had not violated any provisions of the Act.

The court relied on Section 11 of the Act, which provides for the protection of persons acting in good faith. The section states that "no person shall be liable for any offense under this Act if he proves that the act or omission complained of was done in good faith for the purpose of protecting himself or any other person from injury or damage from any wild animal." The court held that the accused had acted in good faith and had not violated any provisions of the Act. The court set aside the order of conviction and sentence and acquitted the accused.

The judgment in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 11 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The section provides protection to persons who act in good faith for the purpose of protecting themselves or others from injury or damage from any wild animal. The court in this case held that the accused had acted in good faith and had not violated any provisions of the Act. The court's decision is in line with the purpose of the Act, which is to protect wildlife and their habitats while also ensuring the safety of human beings.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case sets an important precedent for cases involving the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court's interpretation of Section 11 of the Act provides protection to persons who act in good faith for the purpose of protecting themselves or others from injury or damage from any wild animal. The court's decision in this case is in line with the purpose of the Act, which is to protect wildlife and their habitats while also ensuring the safety of human beings.
