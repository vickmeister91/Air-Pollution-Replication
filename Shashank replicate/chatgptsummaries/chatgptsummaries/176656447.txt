The Bombay High Court has issued a series of court orders related to the environmental impact of chemical storage plants in Mahul Village, Chembur, Mumbai. The case involves multiple respondents, including individuals and companies, and concerns the health hazards caused by exposure to high levels of carcinogenic air pollution. The court orders include a list of all the respondents and their respective addresses, as well as a civil application filed by Anita Dattaray Dhole and others, who are residents of Mahul Village, seeking relief from the environmental hazards caused by the chemical storage plants.

One court order lists various entities and individuals, including Aegis Logistics Ltd., the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and several corporations and individuals residing in Jaihind Nagar-Jawahar Nagar, Khar East, Mumbai-51. The purpose of the court order is not specified. Another court order lists the names and addresses of 114 petitioners who are residents of Jaihind Nagar-Jawahar Nagar in Khar East, Mumbai-51. They are filing a petition against the Assistant Engineer and Assistant Municipal Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's H/East Ward.

The court order lists the parties involved in a case challenging the allotment of tenements reserved for Project Affected Persons in a PAP colony in Mahul, Chembur. The region was sparsely populated until the establishment of State-owned refineries in the 1950s, and now houses 9 major industrial units. The Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 874/2018 have already been relocated to the PAP colony known as the Eversmile Complex in Mahul, Chembur, while the Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 3314/2017 have received notices allotting them tenements in Mahul, Chembur, but have not yet been evicted from their existing structures.

The court order pertains to the Eversmile Complex in Mahul, Chembur, where the Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 3314/2017 have received notices allotting them tenements but have not yet been evicted from their existing structures. The PAP colony comprises of 72 buildings and 17,205 tenements and is located within 300 meters radius of Sealord Containers, Tata Power Thermal Energy Plant, BARC, and HPCL refinery. The Petitioners have contended that the PAP colony is uninhabitable due to severe health issues caused by exposure to high levels of carcinogenic air pollution, threat to the security of the industries and refineries, and lack of hygienic conditions and basic amenities. The court also refers to a judgment of the Western Zone Bench of the National Green Tribunal dated 18th December 2015 in the matter of Charudatt Pandurang Koli v M/s Sea Lord and Ors (OA No. 40/2014) which forms the foundation of the Petitioners' arguments about the toxic air pollution in the region. The State Government has filed a writ petition challenging the portions of the judgment of the National Green Tribunal in 2018, 3 years after it was passed.

The court order states that there is air pollution in the Ambapada and Mahul areas due to the presence of VOCs, which is harmful to human health. The National Green Tribunal has issued directions to prepare a comprehensive action plan for controlling air pollution in these areas, conducting health impact assessment studies, and assessing environmental compliance. The order also directs the formation of a committee to suggest location criteria for hazardous chemical handling industries. The State Government claims that air pollution in Mahul has reduced, but reports from government agencies show that it continues to be disturbingly high.

The court order discusses the high levels of air pollution in Mahul, with concentrations of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found to be above the prescribed standards. The report identifies major sources of VOC emissions as industrial activities, particularly those of BPCL refinery and logistics companies. The report recommends regulation of land use development and control measures at the source to minimize exposure to pollutants. Another NEERI report also records alarming levels of air pollution in Mahul, with major VOC emissions coming from industrial sources. The report highlights the potential for short-term and long-term health effects, including elevated estimated lifetime cancer risk for populations living within approximately 800 meters of oil and gas refineries.

The court order discusses the potential health impacts of living near oil and gas sites, specifically the risks associated with exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are known carcinogens. The NEERI report recommends declaring the Chembur and Mahul region an "Air Control Region" and using remote-based technologies to monitor VOCs. The report also suggests continuing health studies to mitigate risks on the health of people exposed to pollutants from refineries. The IIT report shows that residents of Mahul are still suffering from health issues related to living in the area.

The court order includes a list of health issues and their frequency among a sample population. It also highlights the impact of health problems on livelihood, including job loss and loss of wages due to poor health. Over 140 individuals claimed to have lost their jobs due to health-related issues, and over 200 mentioned loss of wages due to poor health.
