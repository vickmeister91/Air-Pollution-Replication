The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the respondents in a criminal case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The appellant had led oral and documentary evidence, but the court noted that they had failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The court cited established principles that an appellate court should not interfere with an order of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the decision is perverse. The court found that the trial court's findings were just and proper and upheld the acquittal.

The court order states that the trial court was justified in acquitting the respondents of the charges against them and that no illegality or infirmity was committed in the findings recorded by the trial court. The appeal by the appellant was dismissed, and the record and proceedings were sent back to the trial court. Any bail bonds were cancelled.
