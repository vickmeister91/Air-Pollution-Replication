In a recent court order, Dharmendra was granted bail after being accused of possessing wildlife illegally. The defense argued that he was innocent and falsely implicated, and there was no independent witness or legal evidence against him. The court considered the nature of the allegation, period of custody, and lack of criminal history, and allowed the bail application with certain conditions.

The defense's argument that Dharmendra was innocent and falsely implicated was a key factor in the court's decision to grant bail. Without any independent witness or legal evidence against him, the court had to rely on the arguments presented by both the prosecution and defense. In this case, the defense was able to convince the court that Dharmendra was not guilty of the crime he was accused of.

The court also took into account the period of custody that Dharmendra had already served. This is a common factor that courts consider when deciding whether or not to grant bail. In this case, it appears that the court felt that Dharmendra had already spent enough time in custody and that it was appropriate to grant him bail.

Another factor that the court considered was Dharmendra's lack of criminal history. This is also a common factor that courts consider when deciding whether or not to grant bail. In this case, it appears that the court felt that Dharmendra was not a flight risk or a danger to society, and that he was unlikely to commit any further crimes.

Despite granting bail, the court did impose certain conditions on Dharmendra. These conditions included not tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses. Breach of these conditions could result in bail cancellation. This is a common practice in bail cases, as it helps to ensure that the defendant does not interfere with the legal process or intimidate witnesses.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Dharmendra was based on a number of factors, including the defense's argument that he was innocent and falsely implicated, the period of custody he had already served, and his lack of criminal history. While the court did impose certain conditions on his bail, it appears that Dharmendra will be able to await trial outside of custody.
