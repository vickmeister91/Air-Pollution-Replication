Chemfab Alkalis Limited, a chemical manufacturing company, filed two writ petitions against the District Magistrate cum District Collector of Pondicherry and others, challenging the issuance of a 'No Objection Certificate' for the establishment of a petroleum retail outlet near their factory premises. The petitioner argued that the hazardous nature of their factory and the inflammable chemicals stored in it made it dangerous to locate a petroleum bunk near their factory.
