Devendra Jatav, who was arrested by Police Station Van Vibhag, District Morena, in connection with P.O.R. No.9874/2004 registered in relation to the offences punishable under Sections 27, 29, 50, 51 and 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41 and 52 of Indian Forest Act, 1927, had filed an application for bail under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. However, the court rejected the bail application, stating that investigation is yet not over and custodial interrogation of the applicant may be necessitated.

The rejection of the bail application by the court was based on the fact that the investigation was still ongoing and that the custodial interrogation of the applicant may be necessary. The court was of the opinion that releasing the applicant on bail at this stage may hamper the investigation and that it was necessary to keep him in custody to ensure that the investigation is conducted properly.

The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act, 1927 are two important pieces of legislation that are aimed at protecting the wildlife and forests of India. These acts provide for the protection of wildlife and forests by regulating activities that may harm them. The offences under these acts are serious in nature and can attract severe punishment.

The rejection of the bail application by the court is a clear indication that the judiciary takes the protection of wildlife and forests seriously and that those who violate the provisions of these acts will be dealt with strictly. The court's decision to reject the bail application is also a warning to others who may be involved in similar activities that they will not be able to escape the law.

It is important to note that the rejection of the bail application does not mean that the applicant is guilty of the offences he has been charged with. The court has only stated that the investigation is still ongoing and that the custodial interrogation of the applicant may be necessary. The applicant will have the opportunity to defend himself in court and prove his innocence.

In conclusion, the rejection of the bail application filed by Devendra Jatav under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. by the court is a clear indication that the judiciary takes the protection of wildlife and forests seriously. The court's decision to reject the bail application is also a warning to others who may be involved in similar activities that they will not be able to escape the law. It is important to note that the rejection of the bail application does not mean that the applicant is guilty of the offences he has been charged with and that he will have the opportunity to defend himself in court and prove his innocence.
