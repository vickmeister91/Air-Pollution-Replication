The Supreme Court of India recently passed a ruling in a case where industrial unit owners manufacturing sugar and liquor were required to pay water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioners argued that they were not liable to pay the cess as their industries were not covered under the Act. After their protests were ignored, they paid the amount under protest and filed writ petitions seeking a refund.

The Supreme Court later ruled in their favor, stating that their industries did not come under the purview of the Act. The court held that the petitioners were entitled to a refund and directed the respondents to refund the sums realized from the petitioners as water cess after verification of the amount stated to have been paid by them.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons operating and maintaining industrial plants and carrying on certain other activities. The Act was aimed at preventing and controlling water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies.

The petitioners in this case were industrial unit owners who manufactured sugar and liquor. They argued that their industries were not covered under the Act and therefore they were not liable to pay the water cess. However, their protests were ignored and they were forced to pay the amount under protest.

The petitioners then filed writ petitions seeking a refund of the amount paid by them. The Supreme Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, ruled in favor of the petitioners. The court held that the industries of the petitioners did not come under the purview of the Act and therefore they were not liable to pay the water cess.

The court also held that the petitioners were entitled to a refund of the amount paid by them. The respondents, who were the Board and its authorities, had denied the petitioners' request for a refund. However, the court directed the respondents to refund the sums realized from the petitioners as water cess after verification of the amount stated to have been paid by them.

This ruling by the Supreme Court is significant as it clarifies the scope of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Act was enacted to prevent and control water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. However, the Act does not cover all industries and activities. The ruling of the Supreme Court in this case makes it clear that only those industries and activities that come under the purview of the Act are liable to pay the water cess.

The ruling also highlights the importance of the right to seek a refund. The petitioners in this case had paid the amount under protest and had filed writ petitions seeking a refund. The court, after hearing their arguments, ruled in their favor and directed the respondents to refund the amount paid by them. This shows that the right to seek a refund is an important safeguard against arbitrary and unjust actions by authorities.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling in this case clarifies the scope of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and highlights the importance of the right to seek a refund. The ruling makes it clear that only those industries and activities that come under the purview of the Act are liable to pay the water cess. The ruling also shows that the right to seek a refund is an important safeguard against arbitrary and unjust actions by authorities.
