The Orissa High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking relief from sound pollution in Bhubaneswar. The petitioner had requested the court to issue a "Rule Nisi" to prevent sound pollution as per the provisions made in Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rule 119 of Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989, Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Indian Penal Code, 1860.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the State Government to strictly follow Rule 119 of the M.V. Rules to prevent sound pollution in accordance with a previous court decision. The writ petition was allowed to this extent.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of preventing sound pollution, which can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The court's decision to direct the State Government to follow Rule 119 of the M.V. Rules is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal.

Rule 119 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989 states that no person shall sound the horn or use any other sound-emitting device fitted to a motor vehicle in a manner which causes or is likely to cause any annoyance to any person. The rule also specifies that the sound level of the horn or sound-emitting device shall not exceed the prescribed limit.

The court's decision to direct the State Government to follow this rule is significant as it will help in reducing sound pollution caused by motor vehicles. The court's decision is also in line with a previous court decision which had directed the State Government to take measures to prevent sound pollution.

The court's decision is also in accordance with the provisions made in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which aims to protect and improve the environment and prevent hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants and property. The act provides for the regulation of environmental pollution and lays down the standards for emission or discharge of environmental pollutants.

The court's decision is also in line with the provisions made in the Indian Penal Code, 1860, which provides for punishment for offences related to public nuisance, causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others, and mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees or upwards.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Orissa High Court in response to the writ petition filed by the petitioner seeking relief from sound pollution in Bhubaneswar is a significant step towards preventing sound pollution. The court's decision to direct the State Government to strictly follow Rule 119 of the M.V. Rules is a positive development towards achieving this goal. The court's decision is also in line with the provisions made in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Indian Penal Code, 1860, which aim to protect the environment and prevent hazards to human beings and other living creatures.
