The Gauhati High Court recently heard a public interest litigation brought by the President and Secretary of the Human Welfare Organization regarding stone mining activities in the Jatinga river, which flows along the western boundary of the Borail Wildlife Sanctuary. The petitioners claimed that the haphazard mining activities being undertaken by the forest department through the lessees have widened the river, causing erosion in the surrounding areas. The court ordered a scientific study to be conducted by the Director of Geology and Mining, Government of Assam, to determine whether any stone mining activity can take place within the concerned location and if it takes place, what environmental impact it would have on the surrounding areas, including the possibility of aggravating the problem of erosion. The study should also examine the aspect that if any mining activity would be permissible and sustainable for the present, up to what amount of the mining materials that can be removed from the location, beyond which further mining activity would be detrimental to the concern of environment.

The court order requires a scientific study to be conducted by the Director of Geology and Mining to determine the exact location and depth of permissible mining activities in a river. The study report must be submitted to the Central Government/State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority for approval before obtaining necessary environmental clearance. The authorities must then proceed with the E-auction notice for mining activities in strict accordance with the report and the Minor and Mineral Concession Rules, 2013. If any provision of the E-auction notice conflicts with the report, it must be modified before proceeding with the tender process. The public interest litigation is disposed of.

The Gauhati High Court's order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and wildlife in the region. The court recognized the importance of conducting a scientific study to determine the impact of stone mining activities on the Jatinga river and the surrounding areas.
