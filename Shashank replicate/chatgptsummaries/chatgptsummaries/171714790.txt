The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Raju Singh, who was apprehensive of being arrested in connection with a case filed against him for offenses under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, BMMC Rules, and Pollution Control Act. Singh's counsel argued that he was the owner-cum-driver of the tractor mentioned in the written report, which was parked in a no-parking zone and seized by the police.

The court allowed Singh's bail on the condition that he surrenders or is arrested within six weeks and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount. The bailors should be local and have sufficient immovable property within the jurisdiction of the court concerned. Singh must cooperate in the trial and be present on every date fixed by the court, and his absence on two consecutive dates without proper and reasonable reason will lead to the cancellation of his bail bond. If Singh tampers with the evidence or witnesses, the prosecution can move for the cancellation of his bail.
