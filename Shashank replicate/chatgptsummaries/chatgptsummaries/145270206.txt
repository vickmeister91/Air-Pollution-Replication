The Rajasthan High Court recently heard a case in which petitioner Ashok Swami requested that heavy vehicles be directed to use the B-2 Bye Pass instead of passing through Sanganer Town. The court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioner arguing that the B-2 Bye Pass was constructed for heavy traffic and that the State Government's order preventing heavy vehicles from using it was illegal and contrary to public interest. The court did not issue a final decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the issue of heavy traffic passing through Jaipur City and the construction of the B-2 Bye Pass road for heavy vehicles. However, due to the development of residential colonies on both sides of the road, only light vehicles are currently allowed to ply on it. The court directs the Jaipur Traffic Control Board to consider the matter and submit a report on whether heavy vehicles should be allowed on the B-2 Bye Pass road, and if so, what measures should be taken to ensure smooth traffic flow. The Board opines that heavy traffic can be allowed on the B-2 Bye Pass road after certain measures are taken, and suggests improvements to the road and the removal of obstacles.

The court order outlines several directions for the improvement of B-2 Bye Pass Road in Jaipur. These include the removal of trees by the Collector, shifting or removal of electric lines by JVVNL, and the widening of an underpass with a construction period of at least one and a half years. The order also allows heavy traffic on the road after necessary measures are taken, and sets a timeline for various improvements to be completed within two months. The order concludes with the disposal of two related petitions.

The issue of heavy traffic passing through Jaipur City has been a long-standing problem, causing congestion and delays for commuters. The construction of the B-2 Bye Pass road was intended to alleviate this problem by providing a dedicated route for heavy vehicles. However, due to the development of residential colonies on both sides of the road, only light vehicles are currently allowed to ply on it. This has led to a situation where heavy vehicles are forced to pass through Sanganer Town, causing further congestion and delays.

The petitioner in the case argued that the State Government's order preventing heavy vehicles from using the B-2 Bye Pass road was illegal and contrary to public interest. The court heard arguments from both sides but did not issue a final decision on the matter. Instead, the court directed the Jaipur Traffic Control Board to consider the matter and submit a report on whether heavy vehicles should be allowed on the B-2 Bye Pass road, and if so, what measures should be taken to ensure smooth traffic flow.

The Board opined that heavy traffic can be allowed on the B-2 Bye Pass road after certain measures are taken, and suggested improvements to the road and the removal of obstacles. The court order outlines several directions for the improvement of B-2 Bye Pass Road in Jaipur, including the removal of trees by the Collector, shifting or removal of electric lines by JVVNL, and the widening of an underpass with a construction period of at least one and a half years.
