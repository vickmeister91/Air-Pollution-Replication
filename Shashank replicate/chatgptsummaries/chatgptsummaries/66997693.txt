The National Green Tribunal (NGT) took suo-motu cognizance of a news article about dolomite mining in Mandla District, Madhya Pradesh, and issued notices to the Ministry of Environment & Forests, the State of Madhya Pradesh, and several mining companies. The Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) submitted a report stating that 26 of the 36 mines with valid consent to operate were found to be in operation, while two mines were operating irregularly and eight were closed. The MPPCB also stated that eight additional mining leases had been granted in the area, but those mines were not yet in operation and had not applied for consent. The Tribunal issued notices to the erring mining lease holders.

The court order dated May 9, 2013, pertains to erring ML holders Respondent Nos. 7 to 15. The MPPCB filed a status report on August 10, 2013, stating that the Collector (Mines), District Mandla, has direct control over the mines, and a list of 43 mines was furnished. On August 22, 2013, the MPPCB was directed to constitute a committee to inspect all 24 Dolomite Mines under operation and furnish a detailed report. The MPPCB stated that a committee was constituted, and the committee members inspected the mines from August 29 to 31, 2013. The MPPCB submitted that out of 43 mines, 24 are under operation, and 19 units are not under operation. The court ordered a joint inspection team to conduct an inspection of the mines from October 21 to 23, 2013. The report states that the mines are located in clusters at villages Mugdara and Bhatiyatola towards the western side of Banjar river and at Bhawartal, Kakaiya, and Katamal villages located towards the eastern side of the Banjar river. The Respondent MPPCB further stated that all these Dolomite Mines are doing open-cast mining as per the mining plan approved by the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM).

The court order discusses the location and operation of 43 mines in Madhya Pradesh, India. Some of the mines are located within 250 meters of the forest boundary and are operating without proper scientific and technical inputs, leading to environmental damage. The court also discusses the need for an Environment Management Plan and an Eco Sensitive Zone. The court received comments from the Wildlife Institute of India and the Chief Wildlife Warden regarding the impact of the mines on tiger habitats. The court concludes that the issue to be examined is whether the mines are operating in violation of environmental laws and causing damage to wildlife habitats.

The court order discusses the issue of mining in close proximity to wildlife habitats and the need to protect the environment, including wildlife, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving wildlife corridors and genetic diversity among tiger populations. The court also notes that some mines are encroaching on forest land and that action needs to be taken to prevent damage caused by mining operations. The court concludes that mining should only be allowed if it is compatible with protecting the environment and maintaining ecological balance.

The court order references various international conventions and laws related to the protection of the environment and wildlife. It directs officials in Madhya Pradesh to take action against mining companies violating environmental laws and ML conditions, regulate mining activities to avoid disturbing wildlife, and improve coordination between the mining and forest departments. The order also calls for an investigation into officials who allowed mines to operate in violation of the law and directs the matter to be listed in court for compliance on July 31, 2014.
