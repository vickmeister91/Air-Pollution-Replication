The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner, seeking to set aside an order made in Crl.R.P.No.43 of 2016, which confirmed the order made in Crl.M.P.Nos.5071 to 5073 of 2016 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track Court No.1, Erode. The petitioner had filed petitions seeking to reopen the case, get an expert opinion, and send for the cheque produced in STC No.546 of 2013, which were dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner then filed a second revision, which is barred by Section 397 of Cr.P.C. The Criminal Original Petition was ultimately dismissed.
