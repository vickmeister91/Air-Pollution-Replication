The court order pertains to a case where the eligibility of respondents to receive plots under a relocation scheme was cancelled by the appellant due to a policy decision taken by the Cabinet. The learned Single Judge had ruled in favor of the respondents, stating that the policy decision was contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta case. The court also examined the policy decision and found that it did not talk of any INSITU regularization of the industry, but only stated that non-hazardous units situated in certain areas be not considered eligible for alternate plot. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had given directions in the M.C. Mehta case regarding the closure of industrial units in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi.

The court order directs the governments of neighboring states to cooperate in making the NCR region successful for industrial activity by removing hurdles pointed out by the industry. A monitoring committee is appointed to stop illegal industrial activity and ensure compliance with the judgment. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is directed to consider withdrawing exemption notification within three months. The policy for relocation of industries is not arbitrary or discriminatory, and the respondents have failed to show any arbitrariness in the government's action in changing the policy. The court also discusses the concept of legitimate expectation and the possibility of administrative redressal for loss caused by non-delivery of possession of plots.

The court order states that allotments were made to those who could wait for relocation of their industry from non-confirming areas, while those whose industry was situated in residential areas other than specific ones were left out. The court also mentions that two wrongs do not make one right and that a party cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in another case, direction should be given for doing another wrong. The court concludes that the appellant has the right to cancel the eligibility of the respondents and refuse possession in view of the pressing requirements of giving alternate plots to those industries which are in non-confirming areas. The appeals are allowed, and the amount received by the appellants shall be returned to all respondents with interest.
