The Delhi High Court recently heard a case between M/S Rajpur Hydro Power Pvt. Ltd. and M/S PTC India Financial Services Ltd. The appellant claimed that the respondent failed to release the balance loan amount, which was essential for the completion of the project. The respondent threatened to acquire 100% equity shares of the petitioner's promoters. The court dismissed the writ petition as being not maintainable against the respondent since it was not a 'State,' 'an Authority,' or 'an instrumentality of the State.' The appellant argued that the respondent was a subsidiary of a government company, and the board of directors consisted of senior government officers.

The court order lists the names and backgrounds of various individuals who were appointed by the Government of India to the board of directors of PTC India Ltd., a public sector undertaking and promoter company of NTPC Ltd. and other corporations. The order also mentions the current chairman of PTC India Ltd., who was appointed by the government on deputation in 2003 and is also on the board of directors.

The court order lists the members of the board of directors of PTC India Ltd. and their qualifications. The order also references a Supreme Court decision and a case involving the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology to establish tests for determining whether a corporation can be considered an instrumentality or agency of the government. The court will use these tests to determine whether PTC India Ltd. is subject to government control.

The court order discusses whether a company is considered a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The court states that if a body is financially, functionally, and administratively dominated by or under the control of the government, then it is considered a State. However, if the control is merely regulatory, it would not make the body a State. The court also considers whether PTC India Ltd. exercises control over the respondent company and concludes that the respondent company is not a State as it is not discharging a sovereign function, a public duty, or positive obligation of public nature. The court cites the Federal Bank case and observes that a company registered under the Companies Act for the purposes of carrying on any trade or business is a private enterprise to earn livelihood and to make profits out of such activities.

The court order discusses the criteria for determining whether a private company can be subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court concludes that the respondent company does not qualify as an instrumentality of the State or an authority against whom a writ petition can be maintained. The company is a public limited company engaged in purely commercial and private activities, and its activities are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. The court also notes that the presence of IRS and IAS officers on the company's board of directors is not sufficient to infer deep and pervasive governmental control over the company.

The court order discusses a case where the appellant claimed that the respondent company was an instrumentality of the state and therefore subject to writ proceedings. However, the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the state or its authorities had any role or participation in the normal functioning of the respondent company. The court also noted that even if the respondent was considered an instrumentality of the state, a writ petition would not be maintainable to enforce private law rights. The court ultimately dismissed the petition and upheld the judgment of the learned Single Judge.

In summary, the Delhi High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Rajpur Hydro Power Pvt. Ltd. against M/S PTC India Financial Services Ltd. The court found that the respondent company was not a 'State,' 'an Authority,' or 'an instrumentality of the State.' The court used various tests to determine whether PTC India Ltd. was subject to government control and concluded that it was not. The court also discussed the criteria for determining whether a private company can be subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and found that the respondent company did not qualify. The court ultimately dismissed the petition and upheld the judgment of the learned Single Judge.
