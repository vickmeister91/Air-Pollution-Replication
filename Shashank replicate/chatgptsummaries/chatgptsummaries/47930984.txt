The court order in question relates to a writ petition filed by a resident who challenged the consent to operate issued by the Environmental Engineer to a neighboring resident under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner argued that the consent to operate was granted without following the proper procedures and without considering the potential environmental impact of the operation.

The court, however, ruled that the petitioner should not have approached the court directly and should instead have invoked the alternate remedies available to her. The court pointed out that the petitioner could have filed an appeal with the appellate authority or the National Green Tribunal, which are better equipped to handle such matters. The court also noted that the petitioner had the liberty to challenge the consent to operate in other appropriate proceedings.

The court's decision was based on the principle of exhaustion of remedies, which requires that all available remedies be exhausted before approaching the court. This principle is based on the idea that the court should be the last resort for resolving disputes and that other avenues should be explored first.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. It also underscores the need for individuals to be aware of their rights and the available legal remedies in case of any grievances.

In conclusion, the court order in question dismissed the writ petition filed by a resident challenging the consent to operate issued by the Environmental Engineer to a neighboring resident. The court ruled that the petitioner should have invoked the alternate remedies available to her, such as filing an appeal with the appellate authority or the National Green Tribunal, before approaching the court. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court.
