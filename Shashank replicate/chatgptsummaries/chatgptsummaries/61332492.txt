The court order pertains to a writ appeal filed by Smt. Earamma against the State of Karnataka. The case involves the resumption of agricultural land granted to a member of the Scheduled Caste/Tribe community, which was subsequently sold to Earamma. The Assistant Commissioner initially dismissed the petition for resumption, but the Special Deputy Commissioner allowed it, declaring the sale null and void. The learned Single Judge dismissed Earamma's writ petition, and the appeal challenges this decision. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the decision of the Special Deputy Commissioner and the learned Single Judge.

The court order sets aside a previous order passed by the Assistant Commissioner and confirms the decision of the Special Deputy Commissioner and the learned Single Judge. The sale transaction executed in 1960 was found to be in violation of the non-alienation clause of 20 years in the land grant certificate issued in 1955. The appellant's appeal is dismissed as there is no justification or good ground to interfere in the well-considered orders passed by the learned Single Judge and the Special Deputy Commissioner.
