The court order in question pertains to two appeals that were filed against judgments and decrees passed by lower courts in two civil suits. The suits were filed by plaintiffs who claimed possession and injunction against the defendants who were allegedly encroaching on land that was protected by a forest notification. The defendants, on the other hand, claimed adverse possession and ownership by the Irrigation Department.

The court found no merit in the defendants' claims and dismissed the appeals, upholding the judgments and decrees passed by the lower courts. This decision was based on several factors, including the fact that the land in question was protected by a forest notification, which meant that it could not be encroached upon or used for any purpose other than what was specified in the notification.

Furthermore, the court found that the defendants had failed to provide any evidence to support their claims of adverse possession and ownership by the Irrigation Department. In fact, the court noted that the defendants had not even produced any documents to show that they had been in possession of the land for a certain period of time, which is a requirement for claiming adverse possession.

In addition, the court also considered the fact that the plaintiffs had produced several documents to show that they were the rightful owners of the land in question. These documents included sale deeds, mutation entries, and revenue records, all of which were found to be genuine and valid.

Based on these factors, the court concluded that the plaintiffs were the rightful owners of the land and that the defendants had no right to encroach upon it or claim ownership. The court also noted that the lower courts had correctly passed judgments and decrees in favor of the plaintiffs, and that there was no reason to overturn these decisions.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting forest notifications and other legal protections that are in place to safeguard our natural resources. It also highlights the need for individuals and organizations to provide proper documentation and evidence when making claims of ownership or possession, as failure to do so can result in legal consequences.
