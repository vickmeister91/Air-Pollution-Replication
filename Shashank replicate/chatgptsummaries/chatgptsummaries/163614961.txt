Shivcharan Turkar, who has been in custody since 2015 for a forest crime, had his fourth repeat bail application dismissed by the court. The applicant claimed innocence and cited the release of co-accused persons as grounds for bail, but the court found no similarity in conduct and no change in circumstances to warrant a different view. The trial court was directed to conclude the trial as soon as possible.

The case of Shivcharan Turkar has been ongoing since 2015 when he was arrested for a forest crime. Despite his claims of innocence, he has been in custody ever since. In an attempt to secure his release, Turkar has made four repeat bail applications. However, all of these applications have been dismissed by the court.

In his latest bail application, Turkar cited the release of co-accused persons as grounds for bail. He argued that since others involved in the crime had been released, he too should be granted bail. However, the court found no similarity in conduct between Turkar and the co-accused persons. Furthermore, the court found that there had been no change in circumstances to warrant a different view.

The court's decision to dismiss Turkar's bail application was based on the fact that he had already made three previous applications, all of which had been rejected. The court found that there was no new evidence or information that had come to light since the last application that would justify granting bail.

Despite the dismissal of his bail application, Turkar maintains his innocence. He has been in custody for over five years and is eager to have his case resolved. The court has directed the trial court to conclude the trial as soon as possible, which will hopefully bring an end to this long-standing case.

In conclusion, the court has dismissed Shivcharan Turkar's fourth repeat bail application. The court found no similarity in conduct between Turkar and the co-accused persons and no change in circumstances to warrant a different view. The trial court has been directed to conclude the trial as soon as possible.
