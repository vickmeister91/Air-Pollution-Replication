The court order pertains to several writ appeals filed by The Corporation of City of Gulbarga and The State of Karnataka against the State's Secretary to Government and various individuals. The appeals seek to set aside an order/judgment passed by a learned single judge of the High Court of Karnataka in writ petitions related to land records and urban development. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the appeals.

In one of the appeals, the court order requires the Corporation to settle a long-standing dispute over land in Brahmpur, Gulbarga. The Mayor suggests an amicable settlement to improve the Corporation's financial position and end the litigation. The concerned party agrees to retain 14 plots of land and withdraw all cases pending before the Civil Court and City Survey Office. The Corporation can deal with the remaining plots and open space, while the concerned party can deal with the 14 plots retained by them. The concerned party's name will be entered in the Corporation records, and the Corporation can proceed with allotment of plots. The Government approves the settlement, but later withdraws its approval and cancels the resolution. The petitioners challenge the Government's order in writ petitions. The court notes that the petitioners' view is based on misleading information/facts.

In another appeal, the court order discusses a dispute between the Corporation of City of Gulbarga and the erstwhile owner of a property, Seshagiri Rao. The Corporation agreed to let Rao retain 14 plots of land, and the Commissioner of the Corporation filed a petition to transfer the plots to Rao's name. The court found that the Corporation and Rao had entered into a compromise, but this was not recorded in writing and was based on false information. The court also found that the acquisition of the land was completed in 1947-48, and that the Corporation had taken possession of the land. The court concluded that the State Government's subsequent order to review the earlier order could not be sustained.

In yet another appeal, the court order discusses a case where fraud was committed in the acquisition of land by Sri Seshagiri Rao and interested parties in the Corporation. The court found that the Corporation and the Government were misled by false information and that the first order passed by the Government was obtained by fraud. The court also found that the principles of natural justice were not violated as even if the petitioners were granted a hearing, it would be an empty formality. The court ultimately set aside the impugned order and held that the interest of the people at large is paramount over the interest of any individual.

The court order also discusses the principles of natural justice and the power of the government to cancel resolutions or orders passed by the Corporation. The court concludes that the principles of natural justice need not be observed in this case as the petitioners claiming interest in the property acquired it through a person who had no authority in law. The court also states that the government has the power to cancel resolutions or orders if they are in contravention of the law or prejudicial to the interest of the Corporation. The court rejects the petitioners' claim to ownership of the land and suggests that they should proceed against the landlord or the Corporation for appropriate relief.

In the final appeal, the court order allows the appeals and sets aside the previous order passed by the learned Single Judge. The order passed by the Government is confirmed. The petitioners are allowed to file proceedings for appropriate relief, but the court does not recognize any rights of the petitioners in that regard. Any such proceedings will be considered on merits in accordance with the law.

In summary, the court order pertains to several writ appeals filed by The Corporation of City of Gulbarga and The State of Karnataka against the State's Secretary to Government and various individuals. The appeals seek to set aside an order/judgment passed by a learned single judge of the High Court of Karnataka in writ petitions related to land records and urban development. The court has heard arguments from both sides and has made decisions on the appeals. The court has discussed several disputes related to land acquisition and ownership, and has made rulings based on the facts presented. The court has also discussed the principles of natural justice and the power of the government to cancel resolutions or orders passed by the Corporation. Overall, the court has made decisions that prioritize the interest of the people at large over the interest of any individual.
