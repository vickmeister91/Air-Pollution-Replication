The Central Information Commission recently heard an appeal by Shri Prem Prakash Shokeen against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) regarding the budget allocated to DPCC and expenditure against the allocation each head wise and sub head wise for the last three financial years. The Public Information Officer (PIO) replied that there was no budget granted to DPCC by Delhi Government and other Government agencies. The First Appellate Authority (FAA) upheld the reply of PIO. The Appellant approached the Commission with the instant Second Appeal.

The Commission found that DPCC is being run without any budgetary planning and there is no budgetary control being exercised by Govt. of NCT Delhi. The Commission wonders as to how a public authority entrusted to oversee the implementation of anti-pollution laws is running without budgetary provisioning. The Commission finds that the Appellant has made his point through the information accessed under the present RTI application. However, it is for the appropriate authority or judicial forum to issue appropriate instructions to remedy the situation, if warranted. The Appeal is disposed off.

The case highlights the lack of budgetary planning and control exercised by the Delhi Government and other Government agencies in the functioning of DPCC. The Commission expressed concern over the fact that a public authority entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of anti-pollution laws is running without budgetary provisioning. The Commission has urged the appropriate authority or judicial forum to issue appropriate instructions to remedy the situation, if warranted.
