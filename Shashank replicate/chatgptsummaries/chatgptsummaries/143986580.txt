The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner to quash an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Anand, and to direct respondent No.2 to produce certain documents. The petitioner's application was partly allowed by the learned Magistrate, but the petitioner claimed that the documents produced by the complainant were not relevant and useful for bringing truth on the record. The learned Magistrate rejected the petitioner's application, and the learned Sessions Court dismissed the revision application. 

The petitioner then filed a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the two orders passed by the courts below. However, the scope of judicial review is limited, and no interference is called for in the order of the trial court. Hence, the petition is dismissed.

The petitioner's argument was that the documents produced by the complainant were not relevant and useful for bringing truth on the record. However, the learned Magistrate rejected this argument and allowed the documents to be produced. The petitioner then appealed to the Sessions Court, but the revision application was dismissed.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, which provides for the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals by the High Court. However, the High Court found that the scope of judicial review is limited and that no interference is called for in the order of the trial court.

The petitioner's argument was that the documents produced by the complainant were not relevant and useful for bringing truth on the record. However, the court found that the learned Magistrate had already considered this argument and had allowed the documents to be produced. The court also found that the Sessions Court had considered the matter and had dismissed the revision application.

The court noted that the power of superintendence under Article 227 is not an appellate power and that the High Court cannot interfere with the orders of the lower courts unless there is a clear case of jurisdictional error or a manifest error of law. The court found that there was no such error in this case and that the orders of the lower courts were not liable to be interfered with.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the two orders passed by the courts below. The court found that the scope of judicial review is limited and that no interference is called for in the order of the trial court. The court also noted that the power of superintendence under Article 227 is not an appellate power and that the High Court cannot interfere with the orders of the lower courts unless there is a clear case of jurisdictional error or a manifest error of law.
