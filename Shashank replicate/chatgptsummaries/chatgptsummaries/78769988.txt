In a recent case, the petitioner had sought certain documents under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to confront the credibility of witnesses in a bribery case against her. The trial court had dismissed the petition, but the High Court directed that if the witnesses speak about any fact in connection with records maintained by the police station, those records must be furnished to the accused earlier. This direction applies only to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial.

The petitioner had been accused of bribery and was facing trial in a court of law. During the course of the trial, she had sought certain documents under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to confront the credibility of the witnesses who were testifying against her. However, the trial court had dismissed her petition, stating that the documents were not relevant to the case.

The petitioner then approached the High Court, challenging the order of the trial court. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed that if the witnesses speak about any fact in connection with records maintained by the police station, those records must be furnished to the accused earlier. This direction applies only to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial.

The High Court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that both parties in a case should have access to all relevant documents and evidence. The court held that if the witnesses were relying on records maintained by the police station, then the accused should also have access to those records to confront the witnesses and challenge their credibility.

However, the High Court's direction was limited to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial. This means that if the witnesses are not police personnel or if they are from a different police station, then the accused will not have access to the records maintained by the Kannan kurichi police station.

The High Court's decision is significant as it upholds the right of the accused to access all relevant documents and evidence in a case. It also ensures that the principle of natural justice is upheld, which is essential for a fair trial.

In conclusion, the High Court's direction in this case is a step towards ensuring a fair trial for the accused. It upholds the principle of natural justice and ensures that both parties have access to all relevant documents and evidence. However, the direction is limited to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial.
