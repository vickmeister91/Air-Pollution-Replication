In the case of Rajesh vs State of M.P., an application was made under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the application, stating that the provisions under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. are only applicable up to the trial and not in the appeal.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce such documents or things.

In the present case, the appellant had sought a copy of the alleged dying declaration under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court, however, held that the provisions of Section 91 are only applicable up to the trial and not in the appeal. The court further stated that the appellant can obtain a copy of the alleged dying declaration under the Right to Information Act and if produced before the court, it may be considered.

The Right to Information Act, 2005, provides for the right to access information held by public authorities. The Act empowers citizens to seek information from any public authority, including the police, courts, and other government bodies. The Act also provides for the appointment of Public Information Officers (PIOs) and the establishment of Information Commissions to ensure transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities.

In the present case, the court has suggested that the appellant can obtain a copy of the alleged dying declaration under the Right to Information Act. This means that the appellant can file an application under the Act to obtain the information from the public authority that holds it. The public authority, in this case, would be the police or the court that has the alleged dying declaration.

If the appellant is able to obtain a copy of the alleged dying declaration under the Right to Information Act, the same may be produced before the court. The court has stated that if produced before the court, the alleged dying declaration may be considered.

It is important to note that the admissibility of a dying declaration as evidence in a criminal trial is governed by Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Section 32(1) of the Act provides that a statement, written or verbal, made by a person who is dead, whether the statement was made in the form of a declaration, or otherwise, about the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, is a relevant fact in certain cases.

However, for a dying declaration to be admissible as evidence, it must fulfill certain conditions. The declaration must be made by the deceased person while he was in a fit state of mind and had the opportunity to make the statement. The declaration must also relate to the cause of his death or the circumstances leading to his death.

In conclusion, the court has dismissed an application made under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in the case of Rajesh vs State of M.P. The court has stated that the provisions under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. are only applicable up to the trial and not in the appeal. The appellant can obtain a copy of the alleged dying declaration under the Right to Information Act and if produced before the court, it may be considered. It is important to note that the admissibility of a dying declaration as evidence in a criminal trial is governed by Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and certain conditions must be fulfilled for it to be admissible.
