In the state of Kerala, several writ petitions were filed by individuals against various government departments and officials. The petitions were heard on January 31, 2019, and the court delivered its final decision on April 9, 2019. The court order lists the petitioners and respondents in a civil writ petition case heard on January 31, 2019, along with other related cases. The case involves the Kerala Forest Department, the Irrigation Department, and individuals residing in Naduvattom and Malayattoor. The details of the petitions and the parties involved are listed in the order.

One of the cases pertains to a dispute over the usage of the Idamalayar Irrigation Project Main Canal Bund Road by the petitioners who claim to be residents of the locality. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered precedents cited. The Forest Department of the Government of Kerala contended that the land in question was initially forest land and permission had been granted for usage of the properties for specific purposes provided therein by the Central Government. The court considered Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which restricts the de-reservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purposes, and ultimately made a decision based on the arguments presented.

The court order discusses the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Section 24 of the Kerala Forest Act in relation to the use of forest land and roads. The court finds that the use of the forest road for access to properties is permissive and not a right, and that the petitioners have alternate means of access or are seeking to enforce the right of access for commercial purposes. The court dismisses the writ petitions and directs the 4th respondent to consider and pass appropriate orders on a representation within a month.

The court order also includes a list of exhibits submitted by both the petitioners and respondents in a case. The exhibits include copies of letters, agreements, orders, reports, and judgments related to the case. In another case, the exhibits include copies of reports, applications, photographs, licenses, orders, agreements, and other documents related to the case. The order also mentions an interim order passed by the court and the cancellation of an agreement between the petitioner and one of the respondents.

In yet another case, the court order requests a location sketch and a report from the irrigation department. The exhibits submitted by both the petitioner and respondents in this case include reports, questionnaires, application submissions, bills and loan statements, settlement deeds, and copies of government orders and letters.

Overall, the court order pertains to various cases involving government departments and officials in the state of Kerala. The court considered various laws and precedents while making its decisions and directed appropriate action to be taken in some cases. The exhibits submitted by both the petitioners and respondents provide additional context and information related to the cases.
