The Indian judiciary has recently issued two court orders related to environmental protection in the state of Karnataka. The first order pertains to writ petitions filed by residents of Nelamangala Taluk, Bengaluru Rural District, questioning the legality of the Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) established by respondent Nos. 5 and 6 on a contract awarded by respondent Nos. 2 and 4. The petitioners have raised several issues concerning the compliance of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, and other Environment Protection Laws. They have prayed for various reliefs, including the closure of the TSDF, an enquiry into illegalities and violations, and action against the erring individuals/entities. The court has not yet given a final decision on the matter.

The second court order directs a committee to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment to assess the impact of a consortium on a reservoir that provides drinking water to Bangalore city. The order also requires the consortium to deposit a sum of money with the court and transfer it to an escrow account. The court further orders the matter to be transferred to the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, and disposes of the petitions and interlocutory application.

The first court order is significant as it highlights the importance of compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations. The petitioners have raised valid concerns regarding the establishment of the TSDF and its impact on the environment. The court's decision to not yet give a final decision on the matter indicates that further investigation and analysis may be required before a final decision can be made. It is important for all stakeholders involved to cooperate with the investigation and ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect the environment.

The second court order is also significant as it highlights the importance of conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment before undertaking any project that may have an impact on the environment. The consortium in question has been directed to deposit a sum of money with the court and transfer it to an escrow account, which indicates that the court is taking the matter seriously and expects the consortium to take necessary measures to mitigate any potential environmental impact. The transfer of the matter to the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, further emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and the need for specialized bodies to handle such matters.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of environmental protection and the need for compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations. It is important for all stakeholders to cooperate with investigations and take necessary measures to protect the environment. The judiciary plays a crucial role in ensuring that environmental protection laws are enforced and that necessary action is taken against those who violate them.
