The court order pertains to a case where the Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited disconnected electric supply to a petitioner firm engaged in printing, dyeing, bleaching, and washing of cloths, on the direction of the District Administration, Jodhpur, which claimed to have received instructions from the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi. The petitioner challenged the disconnection of electricity supply, but the learned Single Bench dismissed the writ petition, stating that the respondents had acted pursuant to the direction issued by the NGT.

The petitioner appealed, arguing that the NGT had never directed the District Administration, Jodhpur, to take any action to the extent of closing down the business of the petitioner firm by disconnecting electricity supply. The court held that the NGT had directed the District Administration, Jodhpur, to stop illegal washing of Grey/Printed Cloth received from Pali and Balotra, but had not given any authority to instruct Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited to stop electricity supply to the petitioner or any other firm that may be involved in illegal washing of Grey/Printed Cloth received from Pali and Balotra.

The court further held that the District Administration, Jodhpur, had no authority to issue instructions for disconnection of the electricity supply, and the authority available to it under the orders of the NGT was only to the extent of restraining the person/establishment/firm/company from washing printed/grey cloths received from Pali and Balotra. The court order restrains a person or establishment from washing printed/grey cloths received from Pali and Balotra.

The court also mentions that if the petitioner is found guilty of violating the provisions of the Act of 1974, the appropriate course of action is to make a complaint to the State Pollution Board, which can initiate the process to stop electricity supply. The Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited's action is declared illegal, and they are directed to restore electricity connection to the petitioner.

The District Administration, Jodhpur, can take necessary steps in consonance with the National Green Tribunal's directions and the State Pollution Board's power under Section 33-A of the Act of 1974. No costs are ordered.
