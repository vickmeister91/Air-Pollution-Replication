The Kerala High Court in India issued a court order in a case involving Jeyaprasad S.D., who sought to have his benefits reinstated and to continue as a member and chairman of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The order provided background information on a disciplinary action taken against the petitioner for alleged violations of civil service rules. The order included exhibits of various documents related to the case.

In another case, an environmental engineer from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board demanded a bribe of Rs.15 lakhs for a favorable report on a company's trial run. A trap was laid, and several officials were found guilty of creating false defense documents. The accused engineer was censured, and the government proposed to remove him from service. The case was heard by a Division Bench of the court, and the petitioner sought to set aside the orders. The judgment narrated the entire history of the case and ultimately upheld the punishment of censure.

The court ordered that Jayaprasad be censured for misconduct without a regular departmental enquiry. The government called upon Jayaprasad to show cause as to why he should not be removed from the office of the Chairman of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the State should register a criminal case against Jayaprasad for allegations made in the memo of charges dated 31.10.2008. The court also criticized the State for ignoring serious allegations and not verifying the antecedents of the candidate before appointing them to a statutory high office.

In another case, a petitioner filed a W.P.(C) No.19757/2005 seeking a C.B.I investigation, which was ordered by a Single Judge of the Court. The Division Bench set aside the order, directing the Single Judge to hear the matter afresh. The writ petition again came up before another learned Single Judge, who directed the C.B.I. to take over the investigation. The court dismissed W.P.(C) No.20211 of 2010 and W.P.(C)No.11235 of 2010. The court also upheld the punishment of censure imposed by Ext.P6 order. The petitioner filed a review petition seeking an enquiry into the allegations made against him.

The court order pertained to a case involving the termination of the petitioner's appointment as Chairman of the Board. The petitioner sought reinstatement based on the annulment of the penalty of censure imposed on him. However, the court found that the termination was also based on the expiration of his appointment, which was not affected by the annulment of the censure. The court also considered whether the 2nd respondent had the authority to annul the penalty of censure, and found that the petitioner's argument was not convincing.

The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the 2nd respondent had the right to reconsider an order of censure based on a previous court order. The court stated that once an order has attained finality in a constitutional court, a statutory authority cannot annul the order. The court also criticized the conduct of the petitioner for suppressing material facts. The court found that the 2nd respondent had interfered with the administration of justice and may be liable for contempt of court, but any decision on this matter must be made by a Division Bench.

The court order stated that the second respondent is liable to be proceeded against under the Contempt of Courts Act, but any decision in this matter has to be taken only by a Division Bench. The writ petition was dismissed, and the papers were placed before the appropriate bench to consider whether proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act should be initiated against the second respondent.

In summary, the Kerala High Court in India issued several court orders in cases involving alleged violations of civil service rules, bribery, and interference with the administration of justice. The court upheld punishments of censure and criticized the conduct of the petitioners for suppressing material facts. The court also found that the State should register a criminal case against one petitioner and that the second respondent may be liable for contempt of court. The court ordered that any decision on this matter must be made by a Division Bench.
