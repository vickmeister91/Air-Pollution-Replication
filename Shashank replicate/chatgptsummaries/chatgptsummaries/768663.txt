The court noted that the Bihar State Pollution Control Board had taken all necessary precautions to ensure that the establishment of the brick kiln by respondent no.8 did not cause any harm to the environment or the health of the general public.

The court concluded that there was no interference required in the matter and that the establishment of the brick kiln by respondent no.8 was in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.
