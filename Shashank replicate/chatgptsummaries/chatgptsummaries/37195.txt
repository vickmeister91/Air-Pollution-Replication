The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Smt. R. Saroja against Sri Ningaiah. The petitioner had requested the court to set aside an order rejecting her application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. r/W 66 of Indian Evidence Act and an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 66 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that any person summoned to produce a document or thing shall be bound to attend and produce it, subject to certain exceptions.

Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in issue.

The trial court had found that the documents sought to be summoned by the petitioner were irrelevant for proving the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I.Act) and that there was no need to summon them. Section 138 of the N.I.Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer.

The petitioner had argued that the documents were necessary to prove her case and that the trial court had erred in not summoning them. However, the court upheld the trial court's decision and dismissed the petitioner's appeal.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial court had considered the relevance of the documents sought to be summoned and had found them to be irrelevant for proving the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. The court noted that the trial court had also considered the fact that the petitioner had not made out a case for summoning the documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. r/W 66 of Indian Evidence Act.

The court observed that the power to summon documents or witnesses under Section 91 or Section 311 of Cr.P.C. is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The court noted that the trial court had exercised its discretion in a proper manner and that there was no reason to interfere with its decision.

The court's decision highlights the importance of relevance in the context of summoning documents or witnesses in a criminal trial. It also underscores the need for parties to make out a case for summoning documents or witnesses under the relevant provisions of the Cr.P.C. and the Indian Evidence Act.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Smt. R. Saroja against Sri Ningaiah. The court upheld the trial court's decision to reject the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. r/W 66 of Indian Evidence Act and an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial court had considered the relevance of the documents sought to be summoned and had found them to be irrelevant for proving the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. The court's decision underscores the importance of relevance and the need to make out a case for summoning documents or witnesses in a criminal trial.
