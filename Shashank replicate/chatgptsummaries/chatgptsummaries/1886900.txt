In a recent court order, a petition filed by accused persons in a wildlife protection case seeking to quash the proceedings against them was rejected. The accused were charged with trespassing into a wildlife protection area and removing an iron post. The court rejected the petitioners' argument that they had a right to enter the sanctuary as residents and allowed the case to proceed. The accused were advised to raise their contentions before the magistrate and seek an order of discharge if advised.

The case in question pertains to a wildlife protection area where the accused were found to have trespassed and removed an iron post. The accused argued that they had a right to enter the sanctuary as residents, but the court rejected this argument. The court held that the accused had no right to enter the sanctuary without permission and that their actions constituted trespassing.

The court also rejected the petitioners' argument that the removal of the iron post was not a serious offence. The court held that the removal of the post was a serious offence as it could have led to damage to the sanctuary and the wildlife within it.

The court advised the accused to raise their contentions before the magistrate and seek an order of discharge if advised. This means that the accused can still argue their case before the magistrate and seek to have the charges against them dropped. However, the court's order indicates that the accused will have to provide strong evidence to support their arguments.

Overall, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of respecting wildlife protection areas and the laws that govern them. The court's decision to reject the petitioners' argument that they had a right to enter the sanctuary as residents sends a clear message that such arguments will not be accepted in court. The court's advice to the accused to raise their contentions before the magistrate and seek an order of discharge if advised also indicates that the accused still have a chance to argue their case, but they will have to provide strong evidence to support their arguments.
