The Delhi High Court recently passed an order in two writ petitions filed by Naushad Ali and Jatinder Kumar against AVIVA Life Insurance. The petitioners had challenged the order passed by the Ombudsman regarding their claims against the insurance company. They claimed that they were promised a doubling of their policy amount after a lock-in period of three years, but the Ombudsman rejected their claims stating that there was no deficiency of service on the part of the insurance company.

The court observed that detailed evidence was required to prove the terms and conditions of the policy. The petitioners could file a civil suit under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure to establish their claims. The court granted the petitioners the liberty to file a civil suit and disposed of the writ petitions.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of an insurance policy before investing in it. It is essential to read the policy document carefully and seek clarification from the insurance company if any doubts arise. In case of any dispute, it is advisable to approach the Ombudsman or file a civil suit to seek redressal.

The court's order also emphasizes the need for detailed evidence to establish claims in such cases. It is not enough to make a claim based on verbal promises or assumptions. The policy document and other relevant documents must be produced to support the claim.

The order also highlights the role of the Ombudsman in resolving disputes between policyholders and insurance companies. The Ombudsman is an independent body set up by the government to provide speedy and cost-effective resolution of disputes. However, the Ombudsman's decision is not binding on the parties, and they can approach the court if they are not satisfied with the decision.

In conclusion, the court's order in the Naushad Ali and Jatinder Kumar case underscores the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of an insurance policy and the need for detailed evidence to establish claims. It also highlights the role of the Ombudsman in resolving disputes and the option of approaching the court if necessary. It is essential to be aware of these aspects while investing in an insurance policy to avoid any future disputes or complications.
