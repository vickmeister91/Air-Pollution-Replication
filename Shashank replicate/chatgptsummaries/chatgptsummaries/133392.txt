The court has recently issued two orders pertaining to the interpretation of provisions in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The first order deals with the power of authorities to release vehicles seized in the course of an alleged offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The second order discusses the interpretation of provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act regarding the seizure and release of property.

In the first order, the court examines the question of whether authorities have the power to release vehicles used in the course of an alleged offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, after the deletion of Sub-section (2) of Section 50 of the Act. The court concludes that the omission of Sub-section (2) of Section 50 by amendment has the necessary consequence of taking away the power of the prescribed authorities under the Act to grant interim release of seized property, including vehicles, to the person claiming ownership to the same. However, the court finds that the power of the Magistrate as a Criminal Court empowered to deal and try the offense under the Act is not in any manner affected.

The court's decision in this case has significant implications for the release of seized property, including vehicles, in cases involving offenses under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court's ruling clarifies that authorities do not have the power to release seized property, including vehicles, to the person claiming ownership to the same, after the deletion of Sub-section (2) of Section 50 of the Act. However, the court's ruling also clarifies that the power of the Magistrate as a Criminal Court empowered to deal and try the offense under the Act is not affected.

In the second order, the court discusses the interpretation of provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act regarding the seizure and release of property. The court concludes that property seized under Section 50 of the Act cannot become property of the state unless there is a trial and a finding reached by the competent court that the property was used for committing an offense under the Act. The court also holds that any property seized on accusation or suspicion of commission of an offense under the Act can be released by the Magistrate pending trial in accordance with Section 50(1) read with Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

The court's decision in this case has significant implications for the seizure and release of property in cases involving offenses under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The court's ruling clarifies that property seized under Section 50 of the Act cannot become property of the state unless there is a trial and a finding reached by the competent court that the property was used for committing an offense under the Act. The court's ruling also clarifies that any property seized on accusation or suspicion of commission of an offense under the Act can be released by the Magistrate pending trial in accordance with Section 50(1) read with Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

The court further states that the interpretation placed by the State would mean that a specified officer under the Act merely by seizure of property of an accused would deprive him of his property which he might be using for his trade, profession or occupation, which would be a serious encroachment on the fundamental right of a citizen under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution to carry on his trade, occupation or business. This statement by the court highlights the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of citizens, even in cases involving offenses under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

In conclusion, the court's recent orders clarify the interpretation of provisions in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act regarding the seizure and release of property. These orders have significant implications for the release of seized property, including vehicles, in cases involving offenses under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and for the seizure and release of property in cases involving offenses under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The court's rulings emphasize the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of citizens, even in cases involving serious offenses.
