On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in response to multiple cases (CWP Nos.) involving individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The cases revolved around the issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners.

The court order pertained to several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land in Himachal Pradesh. While the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers/unauthorized occupants over the government land(s). The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state government was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land(s) in certain cases and subject to prescribed conditions. Some of the encroachers were 'proprietors' of the village and had sufficient land holdings under their ownership, while others were landless and homeless and had constructed small structures on a piece of government land.

The court refrained from expressing any views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and the authorities were directed to take a holistic view of the matter. The court clarified that the decision would be subject to judicial review and until then, status quo shall be maintained.

The court order highlighted the complexity of the issue of encroachment on government land and the need for a comprehensive policy decision. The court recognized the different categories of people involved in the issue, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court acknowledged that the decision-making process involved more than one government department and required a holistic view of the matter.

The court order also emphasized the importance of judicial review in the decision-making process. The court clarified that the decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land would be subject to judicial review. This ensured that the decision-making process was transparent and accountable.

In conclusion, the court order addressed the issue of encroachment on government land in Himachal Pradesh and directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The court recognized the complexity of the issue and the need for a comprehensive policy decision. The court also emphasized the importance of judicial review in the decision-making process to ensure transparency and accountability.
