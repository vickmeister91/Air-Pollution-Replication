The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also prohibits the trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Bhagdi and Bhuriya were accused of possessing skin and meat of a wild female Blue bull Neelgay, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The Forest Department, Badamalhara, District Chattarpur, registered a case against them under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 52 of the Act. These sections deal with the hunting of wild animals, possession of wildlife products, and punishment for offences under the Act.

The applicants, Bhagdi and Bhuriya, were poor labourers with no criminal antecedents. The court considered this fact and granted them bail. The court also noted that there was no likelihood of their absconding or tampering with the prosecution witness.

The granting of bail to Bhagdi and Bhuriya in this case raises questions about the effectiveness of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in protecting wildlife. The Act was enacted to protect plants and animal species, but cases like this show that violations of the Act still occur. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, possession of wildlife products, and trade in wildlife and wildlife products, but these activities continue to take place.

The case also highlights the issue of poverty and its impact on the enforcement of laws. Bhagdi and Bhuriya were poor labourers, and the court considered this fact while granting them bail. Poverty is a major issue in India, and it affects the enforcement of laws in many ways. Poor people are often unable to access legal services, and they may not be aware of their rights. This can lead to violations of laws, including environmental laws like the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

In conclusion, the granting of bail to Bhagdi and Bhuriya in this case raises important questions about the effectiveness of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in protecting wildlife. The Act was enacted to protect plants and animal species, but violations of the Act still occur. The case also highlights the issue of poverty and its impact on the enforcement of laws. Poverty is a major issue in India, and it affects the enforcement of laws in many ways. It is important to address these issues to ensure that laws are enforced effectively and that wildlife is protected.
