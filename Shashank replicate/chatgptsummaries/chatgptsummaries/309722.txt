The Delhi High Court heard a case in 2008 involving Avnish Bajaj, the Managing Director of a company that owned a website where a video clip of two children engaging in a sexual act was sold. Bajaj sought to have his criminal prosecution for making the video available for sale and causing it to be published annulled. The case raised questions about the criminal liability of directors for offenses attributable to a company, particularly when the company is not arraigned as an accused. The court also discussed the regulation of pornography on the internet and the challenges it poses to governments and legislatures. The court heard evidence about the process of registering as a seller or buyer on the website and the steps taken to prevent objectionable material from being listed. The court ultimately found Bajaj not guilty of the charges against him.

In another court order, the case discussed involved the sale of an obscene video clip on the website baazee.com. The petitioner, Avnish Bajaj, sought to quash the criminal proceedings against him on various grounds. The court examined whether a prima facie case for offenses under Sections 292 and 294 IPC and Section 67 IT Act was made out. The court found that the listing on the website prima facie answered the definition of obscenity and that the website possessed and publicly exhibited the listing. The court also found that the website facilitated the sale of the video clip by carrying the listing, which informed potential buyers that such a pornographic video clip could be procured for a price. The court rejected the petitioner's arguments that he had no direct role in the placing of the listing or its filtering and subsequent removal and that the revenue generated by the website was not profit as contemplated by Section 292 IPC. The court held that a prima facie case had been made out against the petitioner for the offenses under Sections 292 and 294 IPC and Section 67 IT Act.

The court order discusses the charges against Baazee.com for offering obscene material for sale on their website. The court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the company for the offenses under Section 292 IPC and Section 67 IT Act, but not for the offense under Section 294 IPC. The court also discusses the issue of corporate criminal liability and notes that a company can be prosecuted for any offense punishable under law, but the law does not automatically attach liability to a director or employee. Therefore, a specific case must be made out against the petitioner in his individual capacity for the IPC offense.

The court order explains that the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not have a provision for criminal liability of a director or employee when the company is the accused. This means that if a director or employee is to be made an accused, the prosecution will have to make a case against them in their individual capacity. The court also notes that while there is no provision in the IPC for vicarious liability of a director, other statutes like the Essential Commodities Act and the Negotiable Instruments Act have created such provisions. The court further examines the charge sheet in the case at hand and notes that the prosecution will have to establish a prima facie case against the petitioner in his individual capacity and not just as the MD of the company.

In another court order, the case discussed involves a charge sheet against three accused persons for selling/transmitting a pornographic/obscene MMS clip. The charge sheet does not bring out the individual culpability of the petitioner, who was the MD of the company, and only brings out the culpability of the company. The court explains that a director does not automatically become criminally liable for the criminal acts of the company. The court also discusses the offense under Section 67 of the IT Act and the liability of the person in charge of the company. The court cites previous cases to explain that the person-in-charge or an officer of the company may be separately prosecuted or along with the company.

The court order discusses a case involving the liability of directors of a company for offenses under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974. The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court and held that the directors could be made liable even without the company being accused, as long as the company was later arraigned as an accused. The court also discusses the legislative response to regulating the use of the internet to prevent dissemination of pornographic material and concludes that India needs to develop a different legislative model to regulate the use of the internet with a view to prohibiting its use for disseminating child pornographic materials. The court order quashes the case against the petitioner for offenses under Sections 292 and 294 IPC but allows the prosecution of the petitioner for the offense under Section 67 read with Section 85 IT Act to continue.

In summary, these court orders discuss various cases involving the criminal liability of directors for offenses attributable to a company. The courts examine the Indian Penal Code and other statutes to determine the liability of directors and employees in their individual capacity. The courts also discuss the regulation of pornography on the internet and the challenges it poses to governments and legislatures. The courts ultimately make decisions based on the evidence presented and the specific circumstances of each case.
