The first court order pertains to the cancellation of the promotion of Rajeev Sharma, an ex-teacher, to the post of Master due to a mistake in his date of appointment. The petitioner argues that the cancellation of his promotion without an inquiry or opportunity to be heard is a violation of natural justice. The respondents argue that since the promotion was not in accordance with the law, the cancellation was justified.

The court considers the principles of natural justice and the fact that the petitioner was not eligible for promotion and ultimately concludes that the failure to afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner before the cancellation of his promotion does not render the order impugned illegal. The court also discusses the discretion of the court to refuse relief even if there has been a breach of natural justice.

The court order states that two government orders were not legally passed due to lack of notice and lack of power. The court concludes that it is not always necessary to strike down an order passed in violation of natural justice, as doing so may restore an illegal order. In the present case, the petitioner's promotion was based on a wrong assumption and was not entitled to it. Therefore, the court declines to interfere and dismisses the writ petition.

In both court orders, the principles of natural justice are discussed. Natural justice is a fundamental principle of law that requires that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made. The principle of natural justice is based on the idea that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. The principle of natural justice is an essential component of the rule of law and is a fundamental right of every citizen.
