The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order in a writ petition filed by Naresh Mohan Goel. The petitioner had challenged the rejection of his application for an alternative plot under the relocation scheme. The court has set aside the rejection order and given the petitioner two weeks to make a fresh representation to the respondent-DSIIDC. The representation should contain all the documents placed on record by the petitioner before the court.

The court has directed the General Manager (Relocation) DSIIDC to decide the representation by way of a reasoned order within four weeks after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court order is significant as it provides relief to the petitioner who had been denied an alternative plot under the relocation scheme.

The relocation scheme was introduced by the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) to provide alternative plots to those whose land had been acquired for public purposes. The scheme aimed to provide a fair compensation to the landowners and ensure that they were not left without any means of livelihood.

However, the implementation of the scheme has been marred by several issues. Many landowners have complained of irregularities in the allocation of alternative plots. Some have alleged that the plots allotted to them were not suitable for their needs, while others have claimed that they were not given a fair compensation for their land.

In this context, the court order in the case of Naresh Mohan Goel assumes significance. The court has set aside the rejection order and given the petitioner an opportunity to make a fresh representation. This indicates that the court is willing to intervene in cases where there are allegations of irregularities in the implementation of the relocation scheme.

The court has also directed the General Manager (Relocation) DSIIDC to decide the representation by way of a reasoned order within four weeks. This is an important directive as it ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and accountable. The General Manager will have to provide reasons for the decision taken, which will enable the petitioner to understand the basis of the decision.

The court order also highlights the importance of due process in decision-making. The court has given the petitioner an opportunity to make a fresh representation and has directed the General Manager to provide a reasoned order. This ensures that the decision-making process is fair and transparent.
