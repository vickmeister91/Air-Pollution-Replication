The State of Kerala filed an appeal against the judgment in C.C.No.349/2002 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Sulthan Bathery, which acquitted the accused of trespassing into the Rampur Reserve Forest in Sulthan Bathery Range of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and killing a wild pig by using explosives. The trial court acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence connecting him to the crime. The High Court of Kerala, while considering the appeal against acquittal, stated that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of an accused person and that the appellate court is generally reluctant to disturb the finding of fact recorded by the trial court. The court also stated that interference with the judgment of acquittal is not justified if the view taken by the court is a possible view.

The court order states that evidence presented in an appeal must not interfere with the judgment of the trial court. The court refers to several previous cases and concludes that the evidence presented in this case is not reliable enough to convict the respondent of trespassing into a wildlife sanctuary. The prosecution did not provide enough evidence to prove the offense beyond reasonable doubt, and the respondent is entitled to the benefit of doubt. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.
