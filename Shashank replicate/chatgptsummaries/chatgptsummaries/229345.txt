The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to a road widening project in Vadodara-Halol, Gujarat, India. The Lok Hitrakshak Samiti challenged the decision of the State of Gujarat to construct a four-lane toll road from Baroda to Halol, citing concerns about environmental damage and lack of public consultation. They sought an order to restrain the respondents from executing the project and to obtain environmental clearance from the Central Government. The respondents argued that the project was a mere widening and strengthening of the existing road and did not require environmental clearance. 

In the first court order, the court considered the Notification dated 27.1.1994, which required environmental clearance for highway projects except for those relating to improvement work, and ultimately dismissed the petition. The court ruled that the construction of the four-lane highway did not require environmental clearance under the notification. The court also noted that public interest litigation should not be used for private gain and that those who bring such cases should exercise restraint.

In the second court order, the petitioners argued that the project requires environmental clearance, which was not obtained, and that the project violates the statutory notification issued under Section 3(2)(v) read with Rule 5(3)(d) of the Rules framed thereunder. The respondents argued that the project is exempt from environmental clearance under the amended notification dated 10.4.1997. The court considered the arguments of both parties and examined the provisions of the notification. The court also considered the issue of delay in filing the petition and the interpretation of the exemption clause in the notification. Ultimately, the court ruled that the construction of the four-lane highway did not require environmental clearance under the notification.

In the third court order, the court examined the definition of a highway and the power of the executive government to decide on the need for widening or improving existing highways. The court also noted that every policy has to remain within Constitutional bounds and cannot violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution or be contrary to law. The court rejected the petition and discharged the notice with no order as to costs.

In the fourth court order, the court stated that the extent of road widening would not be a justiciable issue unless it is contrary to law. The work of widening the existing highway cannot be scuttled on the basis of a circular by imposing a requirement of environmental clearance from which road widening has been exempted. The court also mentioned that every policy has to remain within Constitutional bounds and cannot violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution or be contrary to law. The court rejected the petition and discharged the notice with no order as to costs.

Overall, these court orders all relate to the same road widening project in Vadodara-Halol, Gujarat, India. The court considered the arguments of both parties and examined the provisions of the notification. Ultimately, the court ruled that the construction of the four-lane highway did not require environmental clearance under the notification. The court also noted that public interest litigation should not be used for private gain and that those who bring such cases should exercise restraint. The court emphasized that every policy has to remain within Constitutional bounds and cannot violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution or be contrary to law.
