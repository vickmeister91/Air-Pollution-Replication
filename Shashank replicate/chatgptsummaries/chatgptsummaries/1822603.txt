The court order in question pertains to a special appeal against an order passed by a learned Single Judge in a civil writ petition. The case involves the exercise of power under Section 6-G of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which allows the State Government to transfer certain proceedings from one Labour Court to another. The court found that the State Government had not given sufficient reasons for the transfer and that the transfer was not justified. 

The order of transfer was set aside, and the records of the proceedings were directed to be transferred to the Labour Court at Allahabad. The Labour Court was directed to complete the proceedings within six months. The appeal was allowed, and the rule was made absolute.

To provide some context, the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is a piece of legislation that governs industrial disputes in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Section 6-G of the Act deals with the power of the State Government to transfer proceedings from one Labour Court to another. This power is typically exercised when there is a need to expedite the proceedings or when there are concerns about the impartiality of the presiding officer.

In this particular case, the State Government had transferred certain proceedings from one Labour Court to another without providing sufficient reasons for the transfer. The court found that this was not justified and set aside the order of transfer. The records of the proceedings were directed to be transferred to the Labour Court at Allahabad, which was instructed to complete the proceedings within six months.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it underscores the importance of providing sufficient reasons for the exercise of power under Section 6-G of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The court's ruling also serves as a reminder that the power to transfer proceedings should be exercised judiciously and only when there is a compelling reason to do so.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the principles of fairness and impartiality in the administration of justice. By setting aside the order of transfer and directing the proceedings to be completed within a specific timeframe, the court has ensured that justice will be served in a timely and efficient manner.
