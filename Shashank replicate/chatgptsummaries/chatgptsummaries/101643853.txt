The court recently heard the case of Bipinkumar Ramanbhai Patel and Subhash Bhaurao, who had filed applications to avoid arrest in connection with an FIR registered against them for selling and distributing genetically modified seeds without the approval of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee. The court issued a notice returnable on 14/08/2019 and granted ad interim protection to the applicants, stating that they shall be released on furnishing PR bond of Rs.50,000/- each and surety in the like amount if they are arrested. The applicants were also required to remain present before the Investigating Officer on 24/07/2019 without fail.

The court order further required the applicants to appear before the Investigating Officer on a specific date and attend the police station once a week until the charge-sheet is filed. They were also instructed to cooperate with the investigation and not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. Failure to appear before the Investigating Officer would result in the withdrawal of the ad interim protection granted by the order.

The use of genetically modified seeds is a contentious issue in India, with many farmers and activists opposing their use due to concerns about their impact on the environment and human health.
