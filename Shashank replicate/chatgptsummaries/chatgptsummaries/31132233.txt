The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Durga Devi against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples and analyze them to determine the standard of water running through the distributories. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court also directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. Compliance report regarding publication of notices imposing compensation or damages for contaminating water shall be placed before the court on the next date of hearing. The court also directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund.

The court order directs the State to take steps for the construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments along the banks of distributories and canal. The State/local authorities are directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. Compliance report regarding publication of notices imposing compensation or damages for contaminating water shall be placed before the court on the next date of hearing. The court also directs the State to prepare a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court orders the removal of all encroachments within one month and directs the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State is also directed to issue show cause notice to persons contributing to pollution and recover compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund.

The court has ordered the removal of structures in an area meant for canal maintenance, as they were found to be causing contamination of the canal water. The state was directed to remove the structures and file a compliance report. The compliance report claimed that there were no structures contributing to contamination, but the court disagreed and ordered an inspection. The court also ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The court has repeatedly ordered the removal of encroachments and the collection of compensation from those polluting the water, but progress has been slow. The court has directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to the environment.

The court order discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching a writ court, which is subject to several checks and restrictions. The court concludes that the petitioner cannot deviate from this principle in this case, as the tribunal has not exceeded its jurisdiction and the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is efficacious. The court dismisses the writ petition but allows the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court has ordered that an appropriate application/representation be filed by December 31, 2016 in the Original Application Nos. 86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Until then, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone the delay and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the State can proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition has been disposed of.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Durga Devi against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies.
