The court order pertains to a criminal appeal against a conviction for possession of a female elephant calf in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The case arose from a search conducted by the Wild Life Department, during which the appellant was found in possession of the elephant calf. The identity of the elephant calf was disputed, and it was found not to have a microchip for identification. The appellant claimed to have acquired the elephant from Itanagar and to possess an ownership certificate, but failed to produce proper documentation. The elephant was seized, and the appellant was arrested and charged with an offense under the Wild Life Act.

The appellant's brother filed an application for the release of the elephant on superdari, claiming ownership, but the application was denied. The court upheld the conviction and sentenced the appellant to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000.

The court order discusses the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and its provisions regarding the ownership and possession of captive animals, specifically an Indian elephant that was seized from the appellant. The court examines the appellant's claim that he had procured the elephant from Itanagar and his subsequent attempts to deny this claim. The court also discusses the relevant sections of the Act, including the requirement for permission to acquire or possess animals listed in Schedule I or Part II of Schedule II, and the regulation of the transfer of such animals. The court ultimately seeks to determine whether the seized elephant is in lawful ownership and possession and what effect this has on the appellant's possession and control of the animal.

The court order discusses the relevant statutory provisions related to the acquisition, possession, and transfer of captive animals under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court examines documents presented by the appellant and his brother claiming ownership of a female elephant named "Rangili" purchased from a fair in Bihar. However, the court finds that the appellant's claim is not supported by evidence, and his assertion that the elephant was acquired from Itanagar was found to be false. The court concludes that the appellant's possession of the seized elephant was illegal under the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court order states that the appellant's claim about a microchip implanted on an elephant's body was found to be false, and the appellant did not produce any documents regarding the purchase of the elephant. Even if the appellant had purchased the elephant, he did not have a valid certificate of ownership, making the custody and control of the animal illegal. The appellant was found guilty of contravening the provisions of Section 40(2) of the Wild Life Act and was sentenced to a minimum of three years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/-. The court also expressed concern about the disorderly manner in which court records are being maintained and urged for strict enforcement of rules and instructions on the subject.

In summary, the court order deals with a case of possession of a female elephant calf in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The appellant claimed ownership of the elephant but failed to produce proper documentation. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Act and found that the appellant's possession of the elephant was illegal. The court upheld the conviction and sentenced the appellant to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. The court also expressed concern about the disorderly maintenance of court records and urged for strict enforcement of rules and instructions on the subject.
