The court order in question pertains to two individuals who had filed for anticipatory bail after being charged with an offence under Section 26(l)(g) of the Indian Forest Act. The offence was registered against them by the Range Forest Officer (Protection), Chandrapur, for carrying out mining activities without prior permission under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The applicants argued that their mining activities were not illegal as their mining lease had been deemed to be extended under Rule 24A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. However, the court rejected their arguments and denied them anticipatory bail, stating that prima facie an offence had been committed.

The case revolves around the interpretation of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The applicants argued that their mining lease had been deemed to be extended under Rule 24A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, which allows for the extension of a mining lease if the lessee has applied for a renewal of the lease before its expiry. They claimed that they had applied for a renewal of their lease before its expiry and therefore their lease had been deemed to be extended.

However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the applicants had failed to produce any evidence to support their claim that they had applied for a renewal of their lease before its expiry. The court also noted that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, requires prior permission from the government before any non-forest activity can be carried out in a forest area. The court held that the applicants had carried out mining activities without obtaining prior permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and therefore prima facie an offence had been committed.

The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the applicants is significant as it indicates that the court believes that there is a strong case against them. Anticipatory bail is granted to individuals who apprehend arrest in a non-bailable offence, and is usually granted if the court believes that the individual is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. However, in this case, the court denied anticipatory bail to the applicants, indicating that it believes that there is a strong case against them and that they are likely to be arrested.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining prior permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, before carrying out any non-forest activity in a forest area. The Act was enacted to protect forests and wildlife in India, and requires prior permission from the government before any non-forest activity can be carried out in a forest area. The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the applicants sends a strong message that the Act must be complied with, and that individuals who carry out non-forest activities without obtaining prior permission are likely to face legal consequences.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the applicants in this case is significant as it indicates that the court believes that there is a strong case against them. The case highlights the importance of complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and obtaining prior permission from the government before carrying out any non-forest activity in a forest area. The court's decision sends a strong message that individuals who carry out non-forest activities without obtaining prior permission are likely to face legal consequences.
