The first court order pertains to a case where a petitioner applied to the Small Cause Court in Bombay to sue as a pauper to recover Rs. 218 due to him on a promissory note. However, the Deputy Registrar of the Small Cause Court refused to allow the petitioner to sue as a pauper. The petitioner then made an application to the Small Cause Court requesting permission to file a suit that day on payment of four annas and to pay the balance of the Court-fees in seven days. The Court allowed the suit to be filed on payment of Re. 1 as court-fee and granted one week's time to pay the balance of court-fee. The petitioner wanted the suit to be deemed to have been instituted on the day on which he made the application under Order XXXIII, Rule 2, of the Civil Procedure Code, for permission to sue as a pauper. However, the Court dismissed the suit as time-barred. The question was whether the Court could grant time to pay the requisite Court-fees after the order refusing leave was passed under Order XXXIII, Rule 7, Civil Procedure Code. The Court held that the order granting time to pay Court-fees on the application under Order XXXIII, Rule 2, must be made before or at the time of the refusal to grant permission to sue as a pauper.

The second court order discusses the process of applying for permission to sue as a pauper and the options available to the court when rejecting such an application. The court may treat the application as an unstamped plaint and allow the applicant time to pay the requisite court fees, but must consider the provisions of Order XXXIII, Rule 15, which requires the payment of costs incurred in the proceedings relating to the inquiry into the applicant's pauperism. If the court rejects the application without keeping it alive as an unstamped plaint and granting the applicant time to pay the requisite court fees, the proceedings come to an end, and the only remedy for the applicant is to file a regular suit under Order XXXIII, Rule 15. The court dismisses the current application and refuses to consider the application of Section 14 of the Indian Limitation Act.

In summary, the court orders deal with the process of applying for permission to sue as a pauper and the options available to the court when rejecting such an application. The court may allow the applicant time to pay the requisite court fees or dismiss the application without keeping it alive as an unstamped plaint. The court must also consider the provisions of Order XXXIII, Rule 15, which requires the payment of costs incurred in the proceedings relating to the inquiry into the applicant's pauperism. If the court rejects the application, the only remedy for the applicant is to file a regular suit under Order XXXIII, Rule 15. Additionally, the court held that the order granting time to pay court fees on the application under Order XXXIII, Rule 2, must be made before or at the time of the refusal to grant permission to sue as a pauper.
