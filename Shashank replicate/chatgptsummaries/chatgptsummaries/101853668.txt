The court order in question pertains to a case where the plaintiff is seeking a declaration that the construction and encroachment made by the defendants in a public area is illegal and a mandatory injunction for its removal. The defendant, in turn, filed an application for dismissal of the suit, stating that the plaintiff has not approached the court with clean hands and that a single person is not competent to file a suit for removal of public nuisance. 

The court, however, dismissed the defendant's application and stated that any person directly affected by encroachment over public land is entitled to maintain a suit for removal of the encroachment. This is a significant ruling as it establishes the right of individuals to take legal action against encroachment on public land, even if they are not part of a larger group or organization. 

The court also addressed the issue of whether the defendant is the owner of the suit land, stating that it is a triable issue. This means that the court will need to hear evidence and arguments from both sides before making a determination on the matter. 

The concept of clean hands is an important one in legal proceedings. It refers to the idea that a plaintiff must come to court with "clean hands," meaning that they have not engaged in any wrongdoing themselves. In this case, the defendant argued that the plaintiff had not approached the court with clean hands, but the court did not find this argument persuasive. 

The court's ruling in this case has important implications for the protection of public land and the rights of individuals to take legal action against encroachment. It establishes that any person who is directly affected by encroachment on public land has the right to take legal action to have the encroachment removed. This is an important protection for public spaces and ensures that individuals have a voice in protecting these spaces. 

Overall, the court's ruling in this case is a significant one that establishes important legal precedents. It affirms the right of individuals to take legal action against encroachment on public land and establishes that the issue of ownership of the land is a triable issue. It also underscores the importance of coming to court with clean hands and the need for individuals to act responsibly in legal proceedings.
