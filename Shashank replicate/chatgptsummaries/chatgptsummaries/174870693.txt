The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal against the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board regarding the relocation of an ash pond for a thermal power plant. The appellants, villagers of six villages in Muthukur Mandal, argued that the relocation violated the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2006 and endangered the environment, agriculture, and human health. The MoEF argued that the EC was granted in accordance with the notification and that the public welcomed the power project. The tribunal ordered the respondents to conduct a fresh Environmental Impact Assessment in accordance with the notification.

The court order discusses a dispute over the relocation of an ash pond for a thermal power project. The project proponent argues that the relocation is necessary to avoid contamination of water bodies and has followed all necessary procedures. The appellants argue that a fresh clearance is required for relocation and that the MoEF's permission is illegal and suffers from non-application of mind. The Pollution Control Board's permission is also questioned. The court will need to determine whether the relocation is legal and whether proper procedures were followed.

The court order discusses a dispute over the relocation of an ash pond for a thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh. The project proponent argues that a fresh environmental clearance is not required as the relocation is within the existing project area, while the appellant argues that a fresh reference to the Ministry is necessary. The court analyzes the Environmental Clearance given to the project proponent and the Environmental Clearance Regulations 2006, and concludes that if a project is proposed to be deviated or altered without expansion and modernization, it does not require a fresh prior Environmental Clearance. However, if a proposal for expansion and modernization with additional capacity crosses the threshold limits given in the schedule after the expansion or modernization, it is deemed to be a fresh proposal which requires fresh consideration and issuance of fresh prior EC.

The court order discusses a case regarding the relocation of an ash pond within the original area of a project. The project proponent requested permission to shift the ash pond to a new location within the project area to avoid proximity to existing fresh water bodies and water creeks. The Ministry of Environment and Forests granted permission for the relocation, subject to certain conditions. The court found that the relocation did not require a fresh Environmental Clearance from the Ministry and that there was no malafide on the part of the respondents. The court also addressed concerns about the new location being a water body, but found that due process had been followed and compensation had been paid to occupants of the area.

The court order states that the reference made to previous judgments in other cases is not applicable to the present case. The court also mentions a previous case where the authorities had found a pond, and the High Court had made significant observations regarding the protection of natural resources. However, the court concludes that the impugned orders of the respondent are valid in law and dismisses the appeal. The order was delivered by Justice Dr. P. Jyothimani and signed by Expert Member Prof. Dr. R. Nagendran on December 17, 2013.
