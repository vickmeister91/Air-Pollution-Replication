The appellants disputed the ownership of the respondent and relied on various provisions of the Revenue Act, 1964. They also contended that the tree felling permission granted under Section 8 of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976 on 01.02.2014 permitting to cut, fell, remove and transport 107 Rosewood trees and 506 of trees of other species in an area of 93.62 acres (37.89 hectares) in Sy.No.56/3 of Kirudale Village, Suntikoppa Hobli, Somarpet Taluk, Kodagu District was contrary to Section 2 of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976.

The respondent was not given an opportunity to contest the claim that the government was the owner of the trees. The court set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and directed the appellants to issue a show-cause notice to the respondent, highlighting relevant statutory provisions and judicial pronouncements, and provide an oral hearing before passing a speaking order. The respondent was also awarded a cost of Rs. 50,000 due to the appellants' dereliction in the matter.
