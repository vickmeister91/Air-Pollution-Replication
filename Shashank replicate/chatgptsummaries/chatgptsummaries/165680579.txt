The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently heard 13 applications filed by different fabric bleaching and dyeing units in Tamil Nadu. The units alleged that they were being wrongly accused of discharging industrial effluents into the Noyyal River, thereby creating water pollution. The NGT heard the matter and directed the Pollution Control Board to inspect each unit and issue orders of consent to operate only to those who have fulfilled all the conditions. The NGT also stated that extra machinery found to be installed or any pipelines laid shall be removed.

The Madras High Court also issued directions to close down the CETPs/IETPs Bleaching & Dyeing units in Tirupur area and disconnect electricity supply until they achieve zero liquid discharge. The court order pertains to the removal of pipelines and machinery from factory premises due to pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching industries in Tirupur. The order also directs the initiation of criminal prosecution against units that have flouted the court's directions and failed to comply with pollution control measures.

The court has granted time to the units to comply with the conditions, failing which they will face closure. The applicants have approached the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board seeking permission to commence operation of their plants, but the Board has not granted any permission. The court has disposed of all applications with the observation that the competent authority shall take a decision on the applications to be filed by the applicants, individually, as expeditiously as possible.
