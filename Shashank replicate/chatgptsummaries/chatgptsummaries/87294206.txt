The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by Mohan Lal and others seeking directions to the respondents to repair and complete forest roads in two different villages. The first petition concerns a forest road from village Tunna to Chandyas (Kamrunag), while the second petition concerns an ambulance road for the residents of Shawa village and other adjoining villages.

In the case of the first petition, the court had ordered a spot inspection to be conducted to assess the condition of the road. The inspection revealed that the bridle path was not motorable and required changes in alignment to be converted into a motorable road. The court noted that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 needed to be followed for processing forest clearance for the same.

In the case of the second petition, the court noted that changes were required to convert a forest department bridle path into an ambulance road. However, permission must be obtained under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court stated that it could not grant the relief sought in the writ petition, but left it open to the state to take appropriate steps in accordance with the law to provide an ambulance road for the residents of Shawa village and other adjoining villages.

Both petitions were disposed of by the court, and all pending applications were also disposed of. The order was issued on December 4, 2019.
