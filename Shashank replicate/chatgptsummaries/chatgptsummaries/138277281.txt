The court has granted bail to Ramu Singh, who had been in custody since March 26, 2017, for offences under Sections 9/51, 39/51, 3(a)/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court did not comment on the merits of the case but found that there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant and his further custody was not warranted. The applicant was ordered to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs.25,000/- with a solvent surety in the like amount to secure his presence before the trial court on all the dates of hearing and to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Ramu Singh was charged under this act, and he had been in custody for over a year. However, the court found that there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant, which means that he did not have a history of criminal activity. This was a significant factor in the court's decision to grant him bail.

The court did not comment on the merits of the case, which means that it did not express an opinion on whether Ramu Singh was guilty or not. The court's decision to grant him bail was based on the fact that his further custody was not warranted. This means that the court did not see any reason to keep him in custody any longer.

The court ordered Ramu Singh to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs.25,000/- with a solvent surety in the like amount. This means that he had to provide a guarantee that he would appear before the trial court on all the dates of hearing. He also had to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code lays down the conditions for granting bail.

The conditions for granting bail include that the accused shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, that he shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, and that he shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer.

In summary, the court granted bail to Ramu Singh, who had been in custody for over a year for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court found that there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant and his further custody was not warranted. The court ordered him to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs.25,000/- with a solvent surety in the like amount to secure his presence before the trial court on all the dates of hearing and to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.
