The court recently issued two orders in relation to a writ petition filed by a petitioner who was denied a quarrying permit and transit passes to extract ordinary earth. The respondents had cited the need for an environmental clearance certificate to carry out the activities. The court examined relevant notifications under the Environment Protection Act and Rules, as well as the provisions of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015, and found that the petitioner would not require an environmental clearance certificate for the construction of a building with a plinth area of up to 20,000M2. However, the petitioner would require a mining permit for excavation in connection with the foundation of the building.

In the first order, the court directed the respondents to consider and pass orders on the petitioner's application for a mining permit and transit passes. This order was issued after the court found that the petitioner did not require an environmental clearance certificate for the construction of the building. The court's decision was based on a careful examination of the relevant notifications and rules, which clearly stated that an environmental clearance certificate was not required for the construction of a building with a plinth area of up to 20,000M2.

In the second order, the court directed the first respondent not to require an environmental clearance certificate from the petitioner for the construction outlined in the building permit. The petitioner was also instructed to provide a copy of the writ petition and the court's judgment to the first respondent for further action. This order was issued after the court found that the petitioner did not require an environmental clearance certificate for the construction of the building.

The court's orders were based on a careful examination of the relevant notifications and rules, as well as the petitioner's application and the respondents' objections. The court found that the petitioner was entitled to a mining permit for excavation in connection with the foundation of the building, but did not require an environmental clearance certificate for the construction of the building itself.

Overall, the court's orders provide clarity on the requirements for obtaining a mining permit and transit passes for the extraction of ordinary earth. The court's careful examination of the relevant notifications and rules ensures that the petitioner's rights are protected while also ensuring that environmental concerns are addressed. The court's orders are a testament to the importance of careful consideration of all relevant factors in making legal decisions.
