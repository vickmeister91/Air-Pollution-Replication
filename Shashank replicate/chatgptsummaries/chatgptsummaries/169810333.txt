The court has granted bail to Memsingh @ Golu, who has been in custody since 25/07/2017 for allegedly possessing 15 k.g. meat of wild boar, which is an offence punishable under Section 2,9,39,50,51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court has allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and has directed the applicant to furnish a bail bond of Rs.20,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including birds and reptiles, without a permit from the government. It also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal or their parts, including meat, skin, and bones.

In this case, Memsingh @ Golu was arrested for allegedly possessing 15 k.g. meat of wild boar, which is a clear violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act imposes strict penalties for such offences, including imprisonment and fines. However, the court has granted bail to the accused without commenting on the merits of the case.

Bail is a legal provision that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. It is granted on the condition that the accused will appear in court on the dates given by the concerned court and will not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence. The court has directed Memsingh @ Golu to furnish a bail bond of Rs.20,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused without commenting on the merits of the case is significant. It indicates that the court has not yet formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of the accused and is willing to give him the benefit of doubt. However, it does not mean that the accused is free from the charges against him. He will still have to face trial and prove his innocence.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and their habitats. It is essential to enforce the Act strictly to prevent the illegal hunting, killing, or capturing of wild animals and the illegal trade in their parts. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused without commenting on the merits of the case should not be seen as a weakening of the Act's provisions. The Act remains in force, and those who violate its provisions will be punished.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Memsingh @ Golu, who has been in custody since 25/07/2017 for allegedly possessing 15 k.g. meat of wild boar, which is an offence punishable under Section 2,9,39,50,51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court has allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and has directed the applicant to furnish a bail bond of Rs.20,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court.
