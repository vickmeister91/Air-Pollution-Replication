The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where individuals were dismissed from their jobs without being given a fair hearing. The principles of natural justice, which are grounded in the Indian Constitution, were cited in all of these cases. The court emphasized that not giving a hearing results in arbitrary decisions that are antithetical to equality.

In the first case, Mrs. Sunita Joshi filed a writ petition against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others, challenging her termination from the Integrated Child Development Programme. She argued that the termination was passed without holding any enquiry and without complying with the provisions of a statutory circular. The court referred to a previous case and held that the principles of natural justice were violated as no procedure was followed for the petitioner's removal and no enquiry with her participation was conducted. The court explained that natural justice is the administration of justice in a commonsense liberal way and is based on natural ideals and human values.

The court order in the second case discusses the importance of natural justice in legal proceedings. Natural justice is called upon when legal justice fails to achieve its purpose. The court emphasizes the principle of audi alteram partem, which means that no one should be condemned unheard. Notice must be precise and unambiguous, and the time given for representation should be adequate. The court also notes that natural justice has undergone changes in recent years and that even administrative orders must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The court provides various definitions of natural justice given by different judges.

In the third case, the court discusses the principles of natural justice, including the rules of 'nemo judex in causa sua' (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side). The court also mentions the "useless formality theory" and its varying interpretations in different cases. The court emphasizes that natural justice is fundamental to fair adjudication and aims to prevent miscarriage of justice. In the specific case being discussed, the court believes that following the audi alteram partem rule is necessary, as the dismissal orders for the Anganwadi workers were identical and lacked individual consideration.

In the fourth case, the court order pertains to three separate cases where the petitioners were dismissed from their jobs without being given a fair hearing. The court cites the principles of natural justice, which are grounded in the Indian Constitution, and states that not giving a hearing results in arbitrary decisions that are antithetical to equality. The court quashes the impugned orders and directs the respondents to reinstate the petitioners forthwith, with backwages and all consequential benefits. In one case, the respondent who did not mark her presence despite notice is to be adjusted somewhere else by the respondents in the neighboring area wherever possible.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of natural justice in legal proceedings and the need for fair hearings before any decision is made. The court cites various principles and rules of natural justice, including the principle of audi alteram partem, and notes that even administrative orders must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The court also emphasizes that natural justice is fundamental to fair adjudication and aims to prevent miscarriage of justice. In all of these cases, the court quashes the impugned orders and directs the respondents to reinstate the petitioners forthwith, with backwages and all consequential benefits.
