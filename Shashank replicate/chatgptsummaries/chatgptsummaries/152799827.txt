The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ petitions filed against the State of Jharkhand and others. The first two court orders do not provide any details about the content or outcome of the petitions. The third court order pertains to a batch of writ petitions challenging the decision of the Government of Jharkhand fixing the distance of saw mills to be 5 kms from the notified forest area and the consequential action taken against the petitioners. The petitions involve a common question of law and are being heard together. The court has taken two lead cases and heard submissions from the petitioners' counsel, who argue that the licenses of the petitioners have been suspended arbitrarily without violation of any terms and conditions of the license granted to them under the Act, 1990 and the Rules, 1993. The court will decide on the matter.

The fourth court order discusses the regulations surrounding saw mills in the State of Jharkhand. The court found that the state authorities did not follow proper procedure in issuing letters to saw mill owners to shift their mills beyond 5 km from the notified forest area. The court also noted that the terms and conditions of the saw mill license, as enumerated in Rule 4 of the Rules 1993, do not mention a condition that saw mills cannot be operated within a distance of 5 km from the notified forest. The court found that the state authorities failed to adopt proper procedure and did not provide an impeccable reason to justify the rationale behind issuing the direction to the saw mill owners to shift their saw mills beyond the 5 km from the notified forest area. The court also noted that the petitioners were not granted any opportunity of hearing before issuance of the impugned notices, directing them to shift their saw mills beyond 5 km from the notified forest area, and thus the action of the respondents is in violation of the principles of natural justice.

The fifth court order discusses the regulation of saw mills in the State of Jharkhand, India. The order outlines the history of regulations and committees established to monitor the location and operation of saw mills, including the formation of a State Level Committee (SLC) under the chairmanship of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests. The order also discusses the guidelines issued by the Government of India regarding the establishment and operation of wood-based industries, including restrictions on location and the role of the SLC in granting licenses and permissions. The court rejects the argument that the newly constituted SLC should revisit previous exercises undertaken by expert committees and upholds the notices issued to saw mill owners to relocate their mills beyond 5 km from notified forests.

The sixth court order directs the Government of India to issue guidelines in accordance with the orders and directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court relating to assessment of timber availability for wood-based industries and grant of license/permission to the said industries. The court has also stated that the petitioners cannot seek any relaxation in the distance fixed by the State Government after due examination of the issue. The court has further held that administrative orders can be issued to supplement the statutory rules, and the government can direct reservation by executive orders.

The seventh court order states that the government can issue executive orders to supplement statutory rules if the rules are silent on a particular point. The regulatory provisions of the Act, 1990 contemplate not only for refusal to grant or renewal of a license but also cessation of the saw mill business even during the currency of the license without any compensation to be paid by the State Government in the interest of the conservation of forests and environment. The court also states that the decision of the State Government fixing the optimum distance of saw mills as 5 Kms. from the notified forest in pursuance of direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and on the basis of the finding of the expert committee is appropriate to protect and safeguard the forests and environment.

The eighth court order states that regulating the business affairs of saw mills and other timber-related industries is necessary for the effective safeguarding of forests and the environment. The writ petitions are dismissed, but the petitioners can file applications for renewal/grant of licenses after shifting their saw mills beyond the distance of 5 kms from the nearest boundary of the notified forest. Several other applications in different cases are also dismissed.

In summary, these court orders pertain to the regulation of saw mills in the State of Jharkhand and the actions taken by the state authorities to protect and safeguard the forests and environment. The court found that the state authorities did not follow proper procedure in issuing letters to saw mill owners to shift their mills beyond 5 km from the notified forest area and that the terms and conditions of the saw mill license do not mention a condition that saw mills cannot be operated within a distance of 5 km from the notified forest. The court also directed the Government of India to issue guidelines in accordance with the orders and directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court relating to assessment of timber availability for wood-based industries and grant of license/permission to the said industries. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petitions but allowed the petitioners to file applications for renewal/grant of licenses after shifting their saw mills beyond the distance of 5 kms from the nearest boundary of the notified forest.
