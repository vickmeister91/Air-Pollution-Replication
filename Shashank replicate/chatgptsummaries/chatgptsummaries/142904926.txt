The recent court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s Omaxe Ltd. and others against the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners sought to quash a complaint case filed against them under the Environment Protection Act. The petitioners argued that they already had an Environment Clearance Certificate before the complaint was filed, making it invalid. The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint case and all subsequent proceedings. The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case and disposed of the petition accordingly.

The case involved a dispute between M/s Omaxe Ltd. and the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners had obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate before the complaint was filed against them. The complaint alleged that the petitioners had violated the provisions of the Environment Protection Act by carrying out construction activities without obtaining the necessary clearances. The petitioners argued that the complaint was invalid as they already had the necessary clearance before the complaint was filed.

The court examined the arguments put forth by both parties and referred to a previous order passed in a similar case. The court observed that in the previous case, it was held that if a person has obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate before the complaint is filed, then the complaint is not maintainable. The court noted that the same principle applied in the present case as well. The court held that since the petitioners had already obtained the necessary clearance before the complaint was filed, the complaint was not maintainable.

The court further observed that the Haryana State Pollution Control Board had not produced any evidence to show that the petitioners had violated the provisions of the Environment Protection Act. The court noted that the mere fact that the petitioners had carried out construction activities did not necessarily mean that they had violated the provisions of the Act. The court held that the complaint was based on conjecture and surmise and was therefore liable to be quashed.

The court also noted that the Haryana State Pollution Control Board had not followed the due process of law while filing the complaint. The court observed that the Board had not given the petitioners an opportunity to be heard before filing the complaint. The court held that this was a violation of the principles of natural justice and that the complaint was therefore liable to be quashed.

In conclusion, the court quashed the complaint case and all subsequent proceedings against the petitioners. The court held that since the petitioners had already obtained the necessary clearance before the complaint was filed, the complaint was not maintainable. The court also held that the complaint was based on conjecture and surmise and was therefore liable to be quashed. The court further held that the Haryana State Pollution Control Board had not followed the due process of law while filing the complaint and that the complaint was therefore liable to be quashed. The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case and disposed of the petition accordingly.
