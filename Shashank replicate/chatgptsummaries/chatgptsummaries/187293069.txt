The National Wildlife Action Plan and the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats scheme are based on this principle and aim to protect wildlife and their habitats. The scheme provides financial assistance for non-recurring and recurring expenditures for conservation efforts, including those for the critically endangered species of Asian Wild Buffalo. The State of Chhattisgarh's lack of funds cannot be accepted as an excuse for not implementing conservation programs for the wild buffalo. The wild buffalo is listed as a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
