In the case of WPMS No.1072 of 2017 in the Uttaranchal High Court, the petitioner, Ms Jai Sai Motors, had filed a writ petition seeking relief against an order passed by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB) directing the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 as environmental compensation for violating the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The petitioner had contended that the order passed by the UPCB was arbitrary and without any basis. However, the court order stated that the petitioner had an alternative statutory remedy to approach the appellate authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Therefore, the writ petition stood dismissed on the ground of an equal efficacious alternative remedy.

The court order was given by Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. on May 16, 2017. The court held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them under the statute, and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable. The court relied on the principle of alternative remedy, which states that a person cannot approach the court directly if there is an alternative remedy available to them under the law.

The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted the alternative remedy available to them under the statute. The court held that the petitioner should have approached the appellate authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, before approaching the court. The court further held that the appellate authority was the appropriate forum to decide the matter, and the petitioner should have approached them first.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference by the court. The court held that the order passed by the UPCB was based on the material available on record, and there was no arbitrariness or illegality in the order. The court held that the petitioner had not been able to show any error in the order passed by the UPCB.

The court order highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies available under the law before approaching the court. The principle of alternative remedy is based on the idea that the court should not interfere in matters where an alternative remedy is available, as it would lead to unnecessary burden on the court and delay in the disposal of cases.

In conclusion, the court order in WPMS No.1072 of 2017 in the Uttaranchal High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Ms Jai Sai Motors on the ground of an equal efficacious alternative remedy available to them under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the petitioner should have approached the appellate authority under the statute before approaching the court. The court order highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies available under the law before approaching the court.
