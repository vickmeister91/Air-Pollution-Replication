The court order discusses the case of DPCC vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing, where the accused is accused of running an industrial unit that was found to be discharging effluent without any treatment or ETP, and thus committed an offense under the Water Act. The court examines the evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense, including the statement of the accused recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. The court notes that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution and that there is no substantial evidence connecting accused no. 2 Shyam Sunder Saini with the said industrial unit. The court ultimately finds that the prosecution has failed to establish the identity of the accused and thus acquits them of the charges.
