The court order pertains to a case where Dena Bank is seeking to recover a loan of Rs.4,65,768.94 with interest and cost from Nilesh Karunakar Shetty and two others. The loan was taken to secure admission for G.P. Rating Cadet Course 51 months with International Maritime Academy, Chennai. The plaintiff claims that the defendants executed various documents in respect of education loan, and the plaintiff sanctioned the loan of Rs.3,51,000/- in favour of the first defendant. The fourth defendant, a training provider company, guaranteed sponsorship for the students for 36 months on board ship training. However, it was discovered that the defendant had committed fraud in collusion with the bank officers, and had not provided the promised training or stipend to the students.
