The Delhi High Court recently disposed of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Manu Mishra against the Government of NCT of Delhi and others. The petitioner had sought various writs and directions to remove encroachments affecting freedom of movement and right of way, frame a comprehensive parking policy, maintain infrastructure concerning roads, footpaths, dividers, crossings, and signages, repair and rebuild roads within a specified time frame, clean rainwater drains, fix responsibility for future encroachments, and issue appropriate writs, orders, or directions to stop encroachments and ensure free movement and right of way.

However, the court observed that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had already passed an order on 2nd September 2019 in a similar case, M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors., which dealt with all the prayers of this writ petition. Therefore, the court disposed of the writ petition and related applications.

The court's decision was based on the principle of res judicata, which means that a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be re-litigated. In this case, the Supreme Court had already dealt with the issues raised by the petitioner in the present writ petition, and therefore, the Delhi High Court could not entertain the same issues again.

The Supreme Court's order in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors. had directed the Delhi government to take various measures to address the issue of encroachments and ensure free movement and right of way. The court had directed the government to remove encroachments from public land, including footpaths, pavements, and roadsides, and to take action against those who had encroached upon public land.

The court had also directed the government to frame a comprehensive parking policy and take steps to ensure that parking was not allowed on footpaths and pavements. The government was also directed to maintain infrastructure concerning roads, footpaths, dividers, crossings, and signages, and to repair and rebuild roads within a specified time frame.

In addition, the court had directed the government to clean rainwater drains and fix responsibility for future encroachments. The court had also directed the government to issue appropriate writs, orders, or directions to stop encroachments and ensure free movement and right of way.

The Delhi High Court's decision to dispose of the present writ petition and related applications was therefore in line with the Supreme Court's order in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors. The court's decision ensures that the issues raised by the petitioner have already been addressed by the Supreme Court, and there is no need to re-litigate the same issues in a different court.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision to dispose of the present writ petition and related applications is a reminder of the principle of res judicata and the importance of following the decisions of higher courts. The court's decision ensures that the issues raised by the petitioner have already been addressed by the Supreme Court, and there is no need to re-litigate the same issues in a different court.
