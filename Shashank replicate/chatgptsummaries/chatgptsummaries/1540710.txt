The court order in question pertains to a case where an application under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) was ordered without the court applying its mind to the provisions of the said section. The section allows a suit to be stayed only if the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties or between the parties under whom they all or any of them claim litigating under the same title. The court found that the order granting stay under Section 10, CPC was wholly unwarranted and in fact, the learned Subordinate Judge has exercised a jurisdiction which is not vested in him by law. The trial court is directed to take up the suit for disposal immediately.
