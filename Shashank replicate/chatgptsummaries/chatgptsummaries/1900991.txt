The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri V Venkateshalu against the Union of India and various state departments. The petitioner had applied for a mining lease and forest land diversion for mining iron ore in Bhavihalii village. The mining lease was subject to clearance certificates from the forest and environment departments. Despite submitting relevant documents, the petitioner did not receive forest clearance certificates for five years. 

The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief in the form of a direction to the respondents to dispose of his application for approval under Section 2 of Forest Conservation Act, 1983.
