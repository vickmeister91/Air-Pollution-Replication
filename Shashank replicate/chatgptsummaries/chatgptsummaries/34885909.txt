The Noyyal River, located in Tamil Nadu, India, has been severely polluted by dyeing, bleaching, and other factories in and around Tiruppur Town. The pollution has rendered the river water unfit for irrigation and drinking purposes, affecting downstream agricultural lands and groundwater. The Noyyal River Ayacutdars Protection Association and individual farmers filed petitions highlighting the pollution caused by these factories. The court had previously passed orders directing the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to take action against the polluting units and to ensure the installation of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) to treat the effluents. However, the units failed to comply with the orders, and the pollution continued.

In response, the court has appointed an expert committee to suggest ways to clean up the stored water and prevent the discharge of polluted trade effluents into the Noyyal river. The Pollution Control Board has also directed all units to set up Reverse Osmosis Plants to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge. The court order mandates that the polluted water bodies, including the Noyyal river, be remediated using the sediment cleared from the Orathapalayam Dam. The Expert Committee recommends that the industry be given until December 2006 to implement Zero Discharge and that all individual units cease discharge to land, river, or other water bodies.

The court emphasizes the duty of the State and every citizen to maintain a hygienic environment and notes that the development and protection of the environment are not enemies, and a balance must be struck. The Polluter Pays Principle and Precautionary Principle are essential features of Sustainable Development. The court directs the CETPs to achieve zero liquid discharge of trade effluents by July 31, 2007, subject to fines and conditions. The court also orders the respondents to deposit compensation and cleaning costs for the dam and river, and directs the Pollution Control Board to process applications for consent and monitor compliance.

The court further orders the demarcation of the river boundary, removal of quarry waste, and cleaning of the river. The Expert and Monitoring Committees are to submit periodical reports, and the Monitoring Committee is to be paid for their services. The matter is adjourned to March 2007.

The Expert Committee has recommended imposing fines on the defaulting CETPs and their member units to neutralize the commercial advantage gained by non-compliance and using the fines for remediation of the Noyyal river and compensating downstream farmers. The court discusses the issue of pollution in the Noyyal river and the need to balance economic interests with environmental protection.

In conclusion, the court orders aim to remediate the polluted water bodies, including the Noyyal river, and prevent the discharge of polluted trade effluents into the river. The court emphasizes the importance of maintaining a hygienic environment and balancing economic interests with environmental protection. The Expert Committee has recommended imposing fines on defaulting CETPs and their member units to neutralize the commercial advantage gained by non-compliance and using the fines for remediation of the Noyyal river and compensating downstream farmers. The matter is adjourned to March 2007, and the Expert and Monitoring Committees are to submit periodical reports.
