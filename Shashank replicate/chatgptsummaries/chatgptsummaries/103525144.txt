The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by B. Ravi Raja against the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and other forest officials in Tamil Nadu. Ravi Raja owns 34 acres of land within a forest region and is seeking the right to use vehicular transport along an existing pathway to access his property. The court recognizes the pre-existing rights of the estate owner and orders the forest authorities to recognize the petitioner's right of way as an easement of necessity. The court also refers to a previous order in a similar case.

The court order states that there is a restriction on the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. Rule 6 of the Forest Conservation Rules provides a procedure for obtaining permission to use forest land for non-forestry purposes. The court recognizes the right of landowners to use forest pathways for vehicular movement and access to their land, but only for authorized purposes. The court also notes that the use of forest land for non-authorized purposes can result in legal action. The court order is based on previous decisions by the Hon'ble First Bench and various learned Single Judges. The respondents claim that allowing vehicular movement on forest pathways would cause hardship and disturbance to wildlife animals and interfere with their natural habitat.

The court order allows the petitioner to use a pathway for vehicular movement, as it is a reasonable request and the petitioner's right of way has been admitted by the respondents. The court also notes that covering the distance by foot would pose a danger to life. The court order does not impose any costs and the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. The court order is dated February 21, 2019.
