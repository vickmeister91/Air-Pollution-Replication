In a recent court order, the case between Ag Ventures Private Limited and M.P. State Bio Diversity Board was addressed. The respondents in the case stated that the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board would be withdrawn, and as a result, the petitioners sought permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court allowed the prayer, and the petitions were dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed.

The case between Ag Ventures Private Limited and M.P. State Bio Diversity Board was centered around a notice issued by the Biodiversity Board. The respondents in the case stated that the notice would be withdrawn, which led the petitioners to seek permission to withdraw their petitions. The court ultimately allowed the prayer and dismissed the petitions as withdrawn.

The court's decision to allow the petitions to be withdrawn with liberty to file afresh if needed provides the petitioners with the opportunity to pursue legal action in the future if necessary. This decision also indicates that the court recognized the validity of the respondents' statement that the notice would be withdrawn.

Overall, this court order serves as a resolution to the case between Ag Ventures Private Limited and M.P. State Bio Diversity Board. The withdrawal of the notice and the dismissal of the petitions provide closure to the matter, while the liberty to file afresh if needed ensures that the petitioners have the ability to pursue legal action in the future if necessary.
