The court order in question pertains to a case where Jitendra Bahadur Singh was appointed on an adhoc basis by the Committee of Management in a substantive vacancy of Assistant Teacher in L.T. Grade at Patel Memorial Inter College, Atraulia, Azamgarh. The legality and validity of the appointment were examined by the court, which found that it was violative of Sub-section (9) of Section 18 of U.P. Act No. 24 of 1992. This was because the candidature of the petitioner was not considered by the Selection Committee constituted under Sub-section (9) of Section 18 of U.P. Act No. 24 of 1992, nor was his name recommended by such Selection Committee.

The court also found that the appointment was violative of the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 16 E of the Intermediate Education Act, 1921. This was because no advertisement of the vacancy in question was made by the Committee of Management in two newspapers having wide circulation in the area. As a result, the court dismissed the special appeal and held that the petitioner may not be entitled to salary from the State Exchequer. However, he may realize it from the Committee of Management if it has taken work from him.
