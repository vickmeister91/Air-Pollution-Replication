The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to stone crusher owners in Rajasthan who challenged orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners claimed that they had been operating their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners had filed detailed replies and requested relevant documents, but the Board had refused to grant consent and directed the closure of their units.

In the first court order, the court heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions and the violation of principles of natural justice. The court noted that the Board had the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent, control, or abate air pollution. The court also observed that the impugned orders were non-speaking orders and violated principles of natural justice. The court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter to the Board for fresh consideration.

The second court order discusses the powers of the Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court also addresses the distinction between orders and directions, and the right to file an appeal against them. The petitioners in the case argue that the Board violated the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The Board argues that it was justified in its actions and cites a similar case where the court upheld its decision. Ultimately, the court finds that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court and that the impugned orders were legally untenable.

The third court order discusses the legal requirements for obtaining consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court finds that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond adequately. The court concludes that the impugned orders are legally unsustainable and dismisses the writ petitions.

In the fourth court order, the court discusses the renewal of consent for an industry and the State Board's ability to refuse consent if pollution control measures are not adequate or properly maintained. The court finds that the Board did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims against the petitioner, M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher, and violated principles of natural justice. The court quashes the impugned orders and directs the Board to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of consent within four months, issue a temporary consent for one month, inspect the sites, and collect air samples. The State Government is also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, in the fifth court order, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, these court orders address the legal requirements for obtaining consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas, the powers of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and the violation of principles of natural justice. The court has quashed impugned orders, remitted matters to the Board for fresh consideration, and directed the Board to consider applications for renewal of consent within a specified time frame. The court has also ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones.
