The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Salochana Devi against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In addition, the court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them for contamination. The state is also ordered to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal within a given time frame. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and directs citizens to be made aware of this through notices. The State is also directed to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the State fails to comply.

The District Collector is ordered to be present on the next posting date, and the State is directed to furnish copies of all compliance reports to the Applicant. The State is also directed to remove all encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through the municipal areas.

The National Green Tribunal has issued an order for the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and for the marking and removal of encroachments. The state government has been directed to comply with the order and remove all encroachments within one month. The District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner of Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust have been directed to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The state government has also been directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000 from them. The compliance report filed by the state government was found to be inadequate, and the Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to file a detailed affidavit.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide relevant information and records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and notes that in certain cases, a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available.

Finally, the court order states that the original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not yet been decided. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order passed by the subordinate court or tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The Tribunal has the power to condone the delay in filing the application within the prescribed limitation. The remedy given under Section 22 of the Act of 2010 is efficacious to meet the injury caused to the petitioner. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until December 31, 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
