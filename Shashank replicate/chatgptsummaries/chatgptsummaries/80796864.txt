The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri N. Bhaskar against the State of Karnataka and others. The petitioner challenged an order issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board directing the petitioner to stop the operation of their silk spinning unit and BESCOM to stop power supply to the petitioner's industry. The petitioner argued that the order was made without notice and without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.

The court noted that the petitioner had never applied for requisite consent under the provisions of The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and without valid consent of the State Pollution Control Board, the industry could not be allowed to operate at the premises where it is located. The court disposed of the petition, stating that the petitioner could make an appropriate application for consent of the Pollution Control Board, and the Board would examine and entertain it in accordance with the law.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board before operating an industry. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 mandates that industries obtain consent from the Pollution Control Board before commencing operations. This is to ensure that industries do not cause harm to the environment and public health.

The court's decision in this case is in line with the provisions of the Act. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board and therefore could not be allowed to operate the industry. The court also noted that the order issued by the Pollution Control Board was in accordance with the law.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of due process. The petitioner had argued that the order was made without notice and without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court did not address this argument directly, but disposed of the petition on the grounds that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board.

The court's decision in this case is likely to have implications for other industries that operate without obtaining the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board. The decision sends a clear message that industries must comply with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and obtain the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board before commencing operations.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board before operating an industry. The decision is in line with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and sends a clear message that industries must comply with the law. The decision also underscores the importance of due process and the need to afford parties an opportunity of hearing before making decisions that affect their rights.
