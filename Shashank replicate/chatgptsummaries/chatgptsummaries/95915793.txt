Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This provision is available to a person who has reason to believe that he or she may be arrested for a non-bailable offence. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect the person from unnecessary harassment and detention.
