The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by M/S Paranjape Schemes, a builder and developer, seeking to quash a complaint lodged by the fifth respondent before the Karnataka Lokayukta and the report of the Lokayukta. The petitioner had entered into a partnership business with M/s.Niketan Shelters Private Limited to construct a housing project named 'Athashri' for senior citizens. The petitioner had received approval from the Mahadevapura City Municipal Council to construct the project, but the Pollution Control Board issued a notice alleging that the construction was without Consent For Establishment (CFE) from the Board and Environment Clearance Certificate (ECC) from the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The petitioner challenged the complaint and charge sheet filed against them. The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner sought to quash a private complaint and charge sheet filed against them. The criminal cases registered on the basis of the complaint were quashed, but a case filed by the Pollution Control Board was rejected and is pending before the Supreme Court. The Division Bench of the Court dismissed the writ petitions filed by the fifth respondent and dropped the contempt case. The Lokayukta issued directions to withdraw permission for construction of a building, but the petitioner argued that the Division Bench had already held that there was no violation of zonal regulations or building bye-laws.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and perused the materials on record. The court order states that the construction of a building by a construction company on a residential plot is not in violation of zoning regulations or building bye-laws. The Supreme Court has dismissed a challenge to this order, and a subsequent complaint filed by the fifth respondent has been rejected. The court finds that the writ petition challenging the validity of the direction of the Hon'ble Lokayukta is not barred under Order 2 Rule 2 of CPC. The complaint, report, D.O. letter, and letter issued by various respondents are quashed.
