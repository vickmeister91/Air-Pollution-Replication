In a recent court order, a criminal miscellaneous petition was dismissed in a case where the petitioner had issued a cheque that was dishonored. The petitioner had requested for the opinion of a handwriting expert to prove that the handwriting on the cheque was not his. However, the court rejected the petitioner's request, stating that the matter had been pending since 2012 and that the case had to be conducted in a summary manner.

The case in question pertains to a criminal complaint filed against the petitioner for issuing a cheque that was dishonored. The petitioner had claimed that the cheque was not issued by him and that the handwriting on the cheque was not his. In order to prove his innocence, the petitioner had requested for the opinion of a handwriting expert.

However, the court rejected the petitioner's request, stating that the matter had been pending since 2012 and that the case had to be conducted in a summary manner. The court noted that the petitioner had not raised any objection to the handwriting on the cheque when it was presented to him for payment. The court also observed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to support his claim that the handwriting on the cheque was not his.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to challenge the authenticity of the cheque or to prove that it was forged. The court observed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the cheque was not issued by him or that it was issued by someone else.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the criminal miscellaneous petition filed by the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for the opinion of a handwriting expert and that the matter had to be conducted in a summary manner.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of presenting evidence in a timely and effective manner. The petitioner in this case had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that the handwriting on the cheque was not his. As a result, the court was unable to consider his request for the opinion of a handwriting expert.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder that evidence is crucial in any legal proceeding. Parties to a case must present their evidence in a timely and effective manner in order to ensure that their case is heard and considered by the court. Failure to do so may result in the dismissal of their case, as was the case with the petitioner in this instance.
