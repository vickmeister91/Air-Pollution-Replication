In a recent court case, the petitioner, Arun, was the fourth accused in a forest range office case for offences under the Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. Arun filed an application for interim custody of his vehicle, which was seized by forest officials along with 3kgs of meat of a protected animal. The learned Magistrate allowed the application subject to the condition that the petitioner produced a bank guarantee for Rs. 40,000. However, the petitioner was unable to produce the bank guarantee, and hence, the court modified the condition and directed the petitioner to execute a bond for Rs. 40,000 with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate. Other conditions imposed by the learned Magistrate will remain in force.
