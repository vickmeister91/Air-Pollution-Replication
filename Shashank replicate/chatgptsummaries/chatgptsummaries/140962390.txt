Two court orders have been summarized in this text. The first court order pertains to a lawsuit filed by Shri Parvin Kumar Sethi against several traffic police officers for damages and compensation due to illegal acts committed by them during the impounding of his commercial vehicle. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined evidence presented by the plaintiff and defendants. The court found in favor of the plaintiff on issues related to notice requirements and non-joinder of parties. The court also examined the impounding of the vehicle and the alleged violation of guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court. The judgment did not provide a final decision on the case but rather discussed the issues and evidence presented.

The second court order pertains to a case where a bus was impounded for violating guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court. The plaintiff claimed that the driver did not violate any guidelines and was asked to pay an illegal gratification by the defendant, which he refused, resulting in the impounding of the vehicle. However, the court found the plaintiff's evidence to be hearsay and unreliable. The court also noted that the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence to support his claims, such as the testimony of passengers or the conductor of the bus. As a result, the court dismissed the plaintiff's case and ordered the file to be consigned to the record-room.
