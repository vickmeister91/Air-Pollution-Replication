The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Bhante Surai Sasai and others against Pawan Maroti Shelare and others. The respondents had filed an application under Section 41-E of the Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950, seeking to restrain the petitioners from selling the Trust property and operating the bank account. The petitioners had filed an application for dismissal of the proceedings on the ground that it was not filed by the persons having interest as required by the Act.

The Joint Charity Commissioner had directed that the application would be decided along with the main proceedings. However, the court set aside the order and directed the Joint Charity Commissioner to decide the application at Exhibit 10 expeditiously on its own merits.

The Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950, is an important piece of legislation that governs the functioning of public trusts in the state of Maharashtra. The Act provides for the registration of public trusts and lays down the rules and regulations that govern their functioning. It also provides for the appointment of a Charity Commissioner who is responsible for overseeing the functioning of public trusts in the state.

In this case, the respondents had filed an application under Section 41-E of the Act, which deals with the power of the Charity Commissioner to restrain the sale or mortgage of any property belonging to a public trust. The respondents had sought to restrain the petitioners from selling the Trust property and operating the bank account.

The petitioners, on the other hand, had filed an application for dismissal of the proceedings on the ground that it was not filed by the persons having interest as required by the Act. The petitioners argued that the respondents did not have the necessary interest to file the application under Section 41-E of the Act.

The Joint Charity Commissioner had directed that the application would be decided along with the main proceedings. However, the court set aside the order and directed the Joint Charity Commissioner to decide the application at Exhibit 10 expeditiously on its own merits.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the procedure to be followed in cases where an application is filed under Section 41-E of the Act. The court has made it clear that such applications must be filed by persons who have a direct interest in the property of the public trust. The court has also directed the Joint Charity Commissioner to decide the application expeditiously on its own merits.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development for the functioning of public trusts in the state of Maharashtra. It provides clarity on the procedure to be followed in cases where an application is filed under Section 41-E of the Act and ensures that only those with a direct interest in the property of the public trust can file such applications.
