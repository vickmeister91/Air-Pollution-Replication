The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case in which the U.P. Pollution Control Board filed a complaint against M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench quashed the complaint case, and the U.P. Pollution Control Board appealed the decision. The only point of consideration was whether the complaint disclosed any material against Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi, Joint Managing Director of M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. The High Court concluded that there was no material to show that Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business. 

However, the Supreme Court reviewed the complaint and found that the accused persons intentionally failed to comply with the conditions of consent order and were responsible for the conduct of the business. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court. The court order pertains to a complaint filed by the appellant-Board against the Director/Joint Managing Director, Directors, Secretaries, and Managers of M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. for not complying with the conditions and not constructing a proper plant for the treatment of their highly polluting trade effluent. The accused persons are deliberately avoiding the provisions of Section 25 of the Act for which they are punishable under Section 44 read with Section 47 of the Act. The court has issued summons to the named persons in the complaint. 

The court also discusses various provisions of the Act, including Sections 25, 26, 44, and 47. The court also cites various decisions of the Supreme Court with reference to the same provisions and the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.PC. The court concludes that the Magistrate is mainly concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in support of the same and he is only to be prima facie satisfied whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. The court also provides guidelines to indicate contingencies where the High Court can quash the proceedings.

The court order states that the High Court was justified in quashing proceedings against the directors of a company as no offense was revealed against them. The court refers to previous cases where the prosecution against directors was quashed due to lack of evidence or improper application of the law. However, in the current case, the company and its directors have been accused of violating environmental laws and causing pollution. The court notes that if an offense has been committed by a company, then every person responsible for the conduct of its business can also be held liable. Therefore, the court allows the trial to proceed against the accused directors and managers of the company.

The court order states that a company in Lucknow is responsible for constructing proper works and plants for the treatment of their highly polluting trade effluent. The directors, managers, and other responsible officers of the company are also liable for not abiding by the provisions of the Act. The court declined to accept the reasoning of the High Court and Sessions Court for quashing the complaint and directed the trial court to proceed with the case. The court emphasizes that cases involving pollution of air and water should not be dealt with lightly and those who discharge noxious polluting effluents should be dealt with strictly. The court also discusses the exercise of inherent jurisdiction and the circumstances under which it may be exercised. The court allows the criminal appeal and directs the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) to proceed with the case in accordance with the law.

In summary, the court order pertains to a complaint filed by the U.P. Pollution Control Board against M/s Modi Carpets Ltd. for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench quashed the complaint case, but the Supreme Court reviewed the complaint and found that the accused persons intentionally failed to comply with the conditions of consent order and were responsible for the conduct of the business. The court allows the trial to proceed against the accused directors and managers of the company. The court emphasizes that cases involving pollution of air and water should not be dealt with lightly and those who discharge noxious polluting effluents should be dealt with strictly. The court also discusses the exercise of inherent jurisdiction and the circumstances under which it may be exercised.
