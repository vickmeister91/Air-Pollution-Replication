The Delhi High Court recently dismissed an application filed by the petitioners, who had prayed for their discharge in a case where a complaint was filed under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The petitioners had filed an application for dropping the proceedings against them, stating that they had ceased to be the Directors of the company before the alleged offence was committed. However, the court held that the complaint must contain averments to attract the rigour of Section 141 and that necessary ingredients must be averred to prompt the court to proceed in this regard.

The court order states that whether a complaint can continue or not depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. If there are no necessary averments and a person is being unnecessarily harassed, the court will not permit the abuse of process of law. However, if the necessary averments exist, the complaint can continue. In this particular case, the necessary ingredients had been pleaded, which prompted the court to issue the notice. Therefore, the petitions must fail and are dismissed.
