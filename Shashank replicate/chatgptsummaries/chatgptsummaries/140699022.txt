The Bombay High Court recently passed a court order in a case filed by Bharatesh Construction Company against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The petitioner claimed that the impugned order passed by the Board on 26/11/2018 was in breach of the principles of natural justice as they had not been given an opportunity to respond to the show cause notice. The court agreed with the petitioner and remanded the matter back to the Board, directing them to treat the impugned order as a show cause notice and grant the petitioner an opportunity to file a reply and a personal hearing.

The court clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The court order is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice, which are fundamental to the rule of law. The principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. This is a basic requirement of fairness and is essential to ensure that justice is done.

The court order also highlights the importance of due process in administrative decision-making. Administrative bodies like the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board are required to follow the principles of natural justice when making decisions that affect the rights and interests of individuals and companies. Failure to do so can result in decisions being overturned by the courts, as was the case in this instance.

The court order is a reminder to administrative bodies to follow due process and to ensure that the principles of natural justice are upheld. It is also a reminder to individuals and companies that they have the right to be heard and to have their views taken into account before any adverse action is taken against them.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the Bombay High Court in the case filed by Bharatesh Construction Company against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and highlights the importance of due process in administrative decision-making. The court order is a reminder to administrative bodies to follow due process and to ensure that the principles of natural justice are upheld. It is also a reminder to individuals and companies that they have the right to be heard and to have their views taken into account before any adverse action is taken against them.
