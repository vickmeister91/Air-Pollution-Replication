The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a revision petition against a criminal complaint filed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complaint was filed by the Divisional Officer without the written consent of the State Board, as required by Section 49 of the Act. The Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the complaint, but the Additional Sessions Judge set aside the order and remanded the case after considering two documents filed by the non-applicant. The petitioners argued that the revisional judge erred in passing the order based on the new documents.

The court held that the documents did not constitute written consent of the Board and that the revisional judge should not have filled gaps in the prosecution's case. The court allowed the revision petition, set aside the impugned order, and restored the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

The case involved a complaint filed by the Divisional Officer against the non-applicant under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complaint alleged that the non-applicant had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby river, causing pollution. The Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it had been filed without the written consent of the State Board, as required by Section 49 of the Act.

The non-applicant then filed a revision petition before the Additional Sessions Judge, who set aside the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Additional Sessions Judge had considered two documents filed by the non-applicant, which he believed constituted written consent of the Board.

The petitioners, who were the original complainants, filed a revision petition before the High Court, challenging the order of the Additional Sessions Judge. They argued that the revisional judge had erred in passing the order based on the new documents filed by the non-applicant.

The High Court examined the documents filed by the non-applicant and held that they did not constitute written consent of the Board. The court noted that Section 49 of the Act required that the complaint be filed with the written consent of the State Board. The court observed that the documents filed by the non-applicant did not contain any express or implied consent of the Board.

The court also held that the revisional judge had erred in filling gaps in the prosecution's case. The court noted that the Additional Sessions Judge had relied on the documents filed by the non-applicant to fill the gap in the prosecution's case, which was the absence of written consent of the Board. The court held that the revisional judge should not have filled gaps in the prosecution's case and that the complaint should have been dismissed for want of written consent of the Board.

In light of these findings, the High Court allowed the revision petition and set aside the order of the Additional Sessions Judge. The court restored the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, dismissing the complaint filed by the Divisional Officer.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has held that a complaint filed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, must be accompanied by the written consent of the State Board. The court has also held that the revisional judge should not fill gaps in the prosecution's case and that the complaint should be dismissed for want of written consent of the Board. This decision reinforces the importance of complying with the procedural requirements of environmental laws and highlights the need for strict adherence to the provisions of such laws.
