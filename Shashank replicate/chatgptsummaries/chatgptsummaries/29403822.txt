Mr. A. Chidambaram had filed two Criminal Original Petitions in the court seeking to set aside an order passed by the learned Judicial Metropolitan Magistrate, IV Fast Track, George Town. The order had dismissed his petitions filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act. The petitioner had argued that the document needed to be sent to the forensic department to ascertain the age of the ink and to prove that the cheque was issued only as security and filled up subsequently.

The court allowed one of the petitions and directed the Postal Department to produce documents, while dismissing the other petition as there is no mechanism available to ascertain the age of the ink. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided sufficient evidence to support his claim that the cheque was issued only as security and filled up subsequently.

The court's decision to allow one of the petitions was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided sufficient evidence to support his claim. The court directed the Postal Department to produce documents that would help ascertain the age of the ink. This decision was significant as it showed that the court was willing to consider the petitioner's arguments and take steps to ensure that justice was served.

However, the court dismissed the other petition as there was no mechanism available to ascertain the age of the ink. This decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not provided sufficient evidence to support his claim. The court's decision was significant as it showed that the court was not willing to accept claims that were not supported by sufficient evidence.

Overall, the court's decision was a balanced one that took into account the evidence presented by the petitioner. The court's decision to allow one of the petitions and direct the Postal Department to produce documents was a positive step towards ensuring that justice was served. However, the court's decision to dismiss the other petition showed that the court was not willing to accept claims that were not supported by sufficient evidence.
