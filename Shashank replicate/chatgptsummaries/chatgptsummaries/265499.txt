In a recent court order, defendants 1, 2, 3, 6 & 7 filed an application for stay of the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendants alleged that the plaintiffs had filed a suit for a declaration that plaintiff No. I is a validly denominated director of defendant No. 7-company, which is identical to the relief claimed in petitions filed by the plaintiffs before the Company Law Board. The defendants sought a stay of the suit until further orders under Section 10.

However, the court found that the issue in the suit and the proceedings pending before the Company Law Board were not substantially the same, and the relief claimed in the suit could not be granted by the Company Law Board. Therefore, the court dismissed the application for stay of the suit.

The case in question involved a dispute between the plaintiffs and defendants 1, 2, 3, 6 & 7 over the appointment of a director in defendant No. 7-company. The plaintiffs had filed a suit seeking a declaration that plaintiff No. I was a validly denominated director of the company. The defendants, on the other hand, had filed an application for stay of the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the stay of a suit where the same matter is already pending before another court or tribunal. In this case, the defendants argued that the relief claimed in the suit was identical to the relief claimed in petitions filed by the plaintiffs before the Company Law Board. Therefore, they sought a stay of the suit until further orders under Section 10.

However, the court found that the issue in the suit and the proceedings pending before the Company Law Board were not substantially the same. The relief claimed in the suit could not be granted by the Company Law Board, as it was a matter of interpretation of the articles of association of the company. Therefore, the court dismissed the application for stay of the suit.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the relief claimed in the suit was not identical to the relief claimed in the petitions filed before the Company Law Board. The court found that the relief claimed in the suit was a matter of interpretation of the articles of association of the company, which could not be granted by the Company Law Board.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The provision is intended to prevent multiple proceedings on the same matter, but it does not apply where the relief claimed in the suit is different from the relief claimed in the proceedings pending before another court or tribunal.

In conclusion, the court order in this case dismissed the application for stay of the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court found that the issue in the suit and the proceedings pending before the Company Law Board were not substantially the same, and the relief claimed in the suit could not be granted by the Company Law Board. The court's decision clarifies the scope of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and highlights the importance of ensuring that the relief claimed in a suit is not identical to the relief claimed in proceedings pending before another court or tribunal.
