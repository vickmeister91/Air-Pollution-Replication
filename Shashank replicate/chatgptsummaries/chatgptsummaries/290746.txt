The New India Assurance Co Ltd had appealed against the award of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Kasargod in O.P.(MV)No.509 of 1998. The claimant, a dealer of Bharath Petroleum, had claimed compensation of Rs.50,000/- for the loss of 400 litres of diesel due to a collision with a bus insured by the appellant company. The Tribunal had found that the accident was due to the negligence of the bus driver and had awarded Rs.36,030/- by way of damages. 

The insurance company had argued that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide the question involved in the case and that the remedy for the party was elsewhere. However, the court had held that the Tribunal had jurisdiction and had dismissed the appeal. This case highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal before filing a claim or appeal.

In this case, the claimant had suffered a loss due to the negligence of the bus driver, who was insured by the appellant company. The claimant had filed a claim for compensation with the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, which had found in their favor and awarded damages. However, the insurance company had appealed the decision, arguing that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide the question involved in the case.

The court had disagreed with the insurance company's argument and had held that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the matter. The court had noted that the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, had conferred jurisdiction on the Tribunal to adjudicate claims for compensation arising out of accidents involving motor vehicles. The court had also observed that the insurance company had not raised any specific ground to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The court had further noted that the insurance company had not denied the fact that the accident had occurred due to the negligence of the bus driver. The court had held that the insurance company was liable to pay compensation to the claimant for the loss suffered by them due to the accident.

This case highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal before filing a claim or appeal. It also emphasizes the need for insurance companies to fulfill their obligations towards their policyholders and pay compensation in cases where their insured vehicles are involved in accidents due to the negligence of their drivers.

In conclusion, the court had dismissed the appeal filed by The New India Assurance Co Ltd and had upheld the decision of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Kasargod. The insurance company was directed to pay the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimant. This case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in motor vehicle accidents to understand their rights and obligations under the law and to seek legal advice if necessary.
