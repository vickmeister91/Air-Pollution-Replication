The court has recently issued two orders in cases related to the construction of a vegetable market yard by a Market Committee in Gujarat. In the first case, a housing society had challenged the permission granted by the authorities for the construction of the market yard on land situated in a residential zone. The court examined the Gujarat Development Control Regulations (GDCR) and found that the development of the land for a wholesale market in a residential zone is not permissible. The court also examined the Gujarat Agricultural Produces Market Act, 1963, and found that the establishment of a vegetable market yard by a Market Committee can be termed as a wholesale market. The court observed that the construction of a vegetable market yard by the Market Committee can be termed as a wholesale market irrespective of whether the vegetables are stored or not. 

The court found that the District Collector and the State Government had committed jurisdictional errors in confirming the permission granted by the authorities for the construction of the market yard. The court held that the permission granted by the authorities is illegal and invalid. This order is significant as it emphasizes the need for compliance with regulations and planning laws specifying the use of land. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that the authorities follow due process and do not grant permissions that are not in line with the law.

In the second case, the Market Committee had started construction of a vegetable market yard without proper building use permission. The court quashed the permission granted by the authorities and stated that the Market Committee must follow the law and the provisions of the Act read with GDCR. The court emphasized the need for compliance with regulations and planning laws specifying the use of land. The court allowed the Market Committee to submit an application for development using the construction already made or to be made, which is expressly permitted under GDCR. However, the court clarified that the petitioner must be given an opportunity of hearing before any decision is taken by the authorities.

These orders are significant as they highlight the need for compliance with regulations and planning laws when it comes to the use of land. They also emphasize the importance of ensuring that the authorities follow due process and do not grant permissions that are not in line with the law. The orders also provide clarity on the definition of a wholesale market and the need for proper building use permission before starting construction. 

Overall, these orders serve as a reminder to all stakeholders involved in the construction and development of land to ensure that they follow the law and regulations in place. Failure to do so can result in legal challenges and the quashing of permissions granted by the authorities. It is important to ensure that the development of land is done in a sustainable and legal manner, taking into account the needs of all stakeholders involved.
