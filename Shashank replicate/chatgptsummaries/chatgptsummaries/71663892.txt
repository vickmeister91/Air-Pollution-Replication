In a recent wildlife protection act case, the court has granted bail to three applicants who had been in custody since November 28, 2014. The applicants were accused of offences punishable under Sections 19, 39 & 48-A/51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicants are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case, and that the trial would take considerable time. The applicants were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.25,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court securing their presence before the trial Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The act has been amended several times over the years to strengthen its provisions and make it more effective in protecting wildlife.

In this particular case, the three applicants had been accused of offences under Sections 19, 39 & 48-A/51 of the act. Section 19 deals with the hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 deals with the possession of wildlife and their products. Section 48-A/51 deals with the punishment for offences under the act, and provides for imprisonment and fines for those found guilty.

The court, however, found that the applicants had been falsely implicated in the case and were innocent. The court also noted that the trial would take considerable time, and therefore granted bail to the applicants. The court directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.25,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court securing their presence before the trial Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

Bail is a legal provision that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused person will appear in court on all the dates of hearing and will not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence. Bail is usually granted when the court is satisfied that the accused person is not a flight risk and will not pose a threat to society.

The court also noted that the applicants had been falsely implicated in the case and were innocent.
