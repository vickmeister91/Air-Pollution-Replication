The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently issued an order in the case of M/s Soni Rice & General Mill. The court ordered that the petitioner must appeal the order (Annexure P-1) through the statutory remedy of appeal as per the provisions of Section 31-B of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This section provides for an appeal before the National Green Tribunal.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief from the order issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). The order had directed the petitioner to shut down their rice mill due to non-compliance with pollution control norms. The petitioner had argued that they had taken necessary steps to comply with the norms and that the order was unjustified.

The court, however, noted that the petitioner had not exhausted the statutory remedy of appeal before the National Green Tribunal. The court observed that the remedy of appeal was available to the petitioner under Section 31-B of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court further noted that the National Green Tribunal was the appropriate forum to decide on the matter.

The court, therefore, disposed of the petition and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal through the statutory remedy of appeal. The court also observed that the National Green Tribunal should decide on the matter expeditiously.

This order highlights the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before approaching the court. The court has reiterated that the National Green Tribunal is the appropriate forum to decide on matters related to pollution control. The order also emphasizes the need for industries to comply with pollution control norms to avoid legal action.
