In a recent case, the petitioner, who was an accused in a Sessions Trial, approached the court to challenge an order passed by the trial court. The trial court had ordered the CID to produce documents and reports prepared by them after investigation. The trial had been pending for over four years, and the trial court had given the accused the right to use documents obtained under the RTI Act as secondary evidence in their defense if the CID failed to produce the original documents.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the trial court had no right to make such an observation as the CID was bound to produce the original documents. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the trial court had not reversed or reviewed its earlier order and had only made provisions to expedite the trial. The court also directed the CID to comply with the trial court's order to produce the original documents.

The case highlights the importance of producing original documents in a trial. The trial court had rightly ordered the CID to produce the original documents, and the accused had the right to use them as evidence in their defense. The court's decision to allow the use of documents obtained under the RTI Act as secondary evidence was a fair provision to expedite the trial, but it should not be used as a substitute for original documents.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for timely disposal of cases. The trial had been pending for over four years, and the court's order to expedite the trial was a step in the right direction. The accused had the right to a speedy trial, and the court's decision to direct the CID to comply with the trial court's order was a positive development.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petition and direct the CID to comply with the trial court's order was a fair and just decision. The accused had the right to use original documents as evidence in their defense, and the court's decision to expedite the trial was a positive step towards timely disposal of cases. The case highlights the importance of producing original documents in a trial and the need for timely disposal of cases.
