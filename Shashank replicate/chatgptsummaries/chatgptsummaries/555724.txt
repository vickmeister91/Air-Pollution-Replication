The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case regarding the levying of a cess on the glass industry under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioner argued that the glass industry was not specified in Schedule 1 of the Act and therefore, the cess could not be levied. The court examined the definition of pollution and the aims and objects of the Act, which were to prevent and control pollution and provide funds to the pollution boards. The court ultimately found that the glass industry fell under the purview of the ceramic industry and was liable to pay the cess.

The court order discusses the classification of the glass industry under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court concludes that the glass industry falls under the non-ferrous metallurgical industry and is subject to the cess levied on water consumption. The court also cites the "polluter pays" principle and the need to prevent pollution in the environment. The writ petitions are dismissed.

The case before the Allahabad High Court centered around the question of whether the glass industry was liable to pay a cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioner argued that the glass industry was not specified in Schedule 1 of the Act and therefore, the cess could not be levied. The court examined the definition of pollution and the aims and objects of the Act, which were to prevent and control pollution and provide funds to the pollution boards.

The court ultimately found that the glass industry fell under the purview of the ceramic industry and was liable to pay the cess. The court noted that the ceramic industry was listed in Schedule 1 of the Act and that the glass industry was similar in nature to the ceramic industry. The court also noted that the Act was intended to be interpreted broadly to achieve its aims and objectives.

The court further noted that the Act was based on the "polluter pays" principle, which holds that those who cause pollution should bear the costs of preventing and controlling it. The court found that the glass industry was a significant consumer of water and that the cess levied on water consumption was a reasonable means of preventing and controlling pollution.

The court also emphasized the need to prevent pollution in the environment. The court noted that the Act was enacted to protect and improve the quality of water and to prevent and control water pollution. The court found that the cess levied on the glass industry was a reasonable means of achieving these objectives.

In its order, the court dismissed the writ petitions filed by the petitioner. The court held that the glass industry fell under the non-ferrous metallurgical industry and was subject to the cess levied on water consumption. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support its claim that the glass industry was not liable to pay the cess.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's order in this case clarifies the classification of the glass industry under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court found that the glass industry fell under the purview of the ceramic industry and was liable to pay the cess.
