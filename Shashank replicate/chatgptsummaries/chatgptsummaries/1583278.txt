In a recent court order, the petitioner, M. Kalanithi Maran, Managing Director of Sun TV Limited, filed a criminal original petition seeking to quash a written order issued by the respondent under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The respondent had directed the petitioner to produce certain documents related to a case registered against him for offenses punishable under Sections 120-B r/w.417 and 153 IPC. The petitioner argued that the respondent had exceeded his jurisdiction in issuing the order as Section 91 does not apply to an accused person. 

The court considered the arguments of both parties and held that the term 'the person' employed in Section 91 does not include the 'accused person' and therefore, the respondent cannot invoke his powers under Section 91 against the petitioner. The court order states that the term 'the person' in Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. does not include the accused person. Therefore, the respondent has no authority to summon the petitioner, who is an accused in the case, to produce materials. The order quashes the notice sent by the respondent to the petitioner and closes the case.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section provides that the summons or order may be issued to any person who is in possession of such document or thing. However, the court order clarifies that the term 'the person' does not include the accused person.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and limits the powers of the respondent to summon an accused person to produce materials. The order also highlights the importance of protecting the rights of the accused and ensuring that they are not subjected to unnecessary harassment or inconvenience.

The court order is likely to have a significant impact on future cases where Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is invoked against accused persons. It is expected that the order will be cited as a precedent in similar cases and will be relied upon by accused persons to protect their rights.

In conclusion, the recent court order clarifying the scope of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is a significant development in criminal law. The order limits the powers of the respondent to summon an accused person to produce materials and highlights the importance of protecting the rights of the accused. The order is likely to have a significant impact on future cases and will be relied upon by accused persons to protect their rights.
