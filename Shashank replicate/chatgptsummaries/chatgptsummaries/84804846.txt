The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues of pollution and encroachment on canals in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, India. The first order, which was filed by Smt. Krishna Devi against the State of Rajasthan and various officials, concerns the pollution of water in minor canals passing through the district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court also noted that one of the related cases, WP No. 718/2009, which concerns the main Ganga Nahar Canal, had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The second court order concerns the pollution and contamination of the Ganganahar Canal and its distributories. The State was directed to come up with short and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court ordered the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this direction. The court also directed the State to submit a report on the steps taken for construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. The case was listed for further hearing on 10th July 2015. The court later directed the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next date of posting. The court also directed the State to furnish copies of all compliance reports to the applicant.

The third court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, and the State's lack of action in removing them. The court directs the State to remove all encroachments within one month and provides a list of officials who must provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State is also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation for causing pollution. The court notes that the State has not complied with previous orders and warns that appropriate action will be taken if they do not comply. The order also discusses the possibility of covering the canal with concrete and removing structures meant for maintenance of the canal.

The fourth court order directs the state to comply with the directions given by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments from the Indira Gandhi Canal and the collection of compensation from the encroachers. The State is also directed to file a compliance report. The court expresses concern over the slow progress made by the District Administration and orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to the environment. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The final court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist on a party to avail alternative remedy if it is efficacious. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation. The NGT possess ample power to condone the delay, and the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December, 2016.

Overall, these court orders highlight the ongoing issues of pollution and encroachment on canals in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, and the efforts being made by the courts and the NGT to address these issues. The orders direct the State to take effective measures to remove encroachments and pollution, and to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The courts also warn that appropriate action will be taken if the State does not comply with these orders.
