The case in question involved a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. by the petitioner, seeking to set aside the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate and the revisional court, which had refused to release Tractor No.RJ-11-RA-6902 along with Trolley, to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of case FIR No.21/2018, registered at Police Station Langra, District Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor along with trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The petitioner was required to keep the tractor and trolley so released intact and not change their identification. The petitioner was also required to produce the tractor and trolley as and when the trial court required the same for proposed identification of the case property. Additionally, the petitioner was required to execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court was empowered to impose any or other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. Finally, the trial court was required to make verification that the petitioner is the registered owner of the tractor.

The case involved the release of a tractor and trolley that had been seized as case property in a criminal case. The petitioner had sought the release of the tractor and trolley, which had been seized by the police in connection with a case registered at Police Station Langra, District Karauli. The case involved offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The petitioner was required to keep the tractor and trolley so released intact and not change their identification. The petitioner was also required to produce the tractor and trolley as and when the trial court required the same for proposed identification of the case property. Additionally, the petitioner was required to execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court was empowered to impose any or other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. Finally, the trial court was required to make verification that the petitioner is the registered owner of the tractor.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the tractor and trolley were not required for the purpose of investigation or trial, and that their continued detention would cause undue hardship to the petitioner. The court also noted that the petitioner had provided sufficient evidence to establish that he was the registered owner of the tractor, and that there was no reason to believe that he would not comply with the conditions imposed by the court.

Overall, the court's decision was a balanced one, taking into account the interests of both the petitioner and the state. The court recognized the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases, but also recognized that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley would cause undue hardship to the petitioner. By imposing conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley, the court ensured that the interests of both parties were protected.
