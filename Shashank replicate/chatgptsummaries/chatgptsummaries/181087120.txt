The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Mohsin Ali against a judgment passed by the Trial Court in 2007. The appellant had been convicted for the unlawful trade of wild birds and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000. The appeal was filed in 2013 on the grounds that the appellant had already completed his sentence and was serving six months for not depositing the fine.

However, the court dismissed the appeal, stating that a fresh appeal against the same order was not maintainable. The court ordered the trial court record to be sent back with a copy of the order. This means that the appellant's appeal was not accepted, and the original judgment of the Trial Court stands.

The case against Mohsin Ali was related to the illegal trade of wild birds. The appellant was found guilty of violating the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal or bird. The act also prohibits the trade of any wild animal or bird or their parts.

The conviction and sentencing of Mohsin Ali were based on evidence presented by the prosecution. The prosecution had presented evidence that the appellant was involved in the illegal trade of wild birds. The evidence included the recovery of several wild birds from the appellant's possession.

The Trial Court had found the evidence presented by the prosecution to be sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellant. The court had also found that the appellant had violated the Wildlife Protection Act and had sentenced him to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000.

The appellant had filed an appeal against this judgment in 2013. The appeal was based on the grounds that the appellant had already completed his sentence and was serving six months for not depositing the fine. The appellant had argued that since he had already served his sentence, the appeal against the original judgment was not maintainable.

However, the court dismissed the appeal, stating that a fresh appeal against the same order was not maintainable. The court ordered the trial court record to be sent back with a copy of the order. This means that the appellant's appeal was not accepted, and the original judgment of the Trial Court stands.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Mohsin Ali against a judgment passed by the Trial Court in 2007.
