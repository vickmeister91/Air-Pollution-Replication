In a recent court order, the Madurai Judicial Magistrate No.V has refused to quash the charge sheet in C.C.No.206 of 2016 filed against Vijayakumar and Jeiganesh. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioners were found in possession of some animal parts of wild animals without a valid license. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to a relevant judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The court did not quash the charge sheet and allowed the case to proceed.

The court order states that a complaint cannot be quashed unless it does not disclose any offense or is frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive. The court cannot interfere with the investigation if the FIR discloses prima facie commission of a cognizable offense. The personal appearance of the petitioner before the trial court may be dispensed with, except for certain procedures. The court is not inclined to quash the Charge Sheet and directs the trial court to complete the trial within three months. The order cites relevant judgments to support its decision.
