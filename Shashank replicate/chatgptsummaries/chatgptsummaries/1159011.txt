The court order in question pertains to an application made by the plaintiffs to appeal to the Privy Council against the judgment of the court that dismissed their suit. The plaintiffs argued that the subject matter of the suit was worth Rs. 10,000 or more and that the decree involved a claim to property of similar value. However, the court found that the subject matter was not worth Rs. 10,000 or more and that the claim did not involve property of similar value. The court also found that no substantial question of law of general interest or importance was involved in the case. Therefore, the court refused the application for leave to appeal.

The plaintiffs had brought a suit before the court, which was dismissed. They then sought to appeal the decision to the Privy Council, arguing that the subject matter of the suit was worth Rs. 10,000 or more and that the decree involved a claim to property of similar value. However, the court found that the subject matter was not worth Rs. 10,000 or more and that the claim did not involve property of similar value. This finding was crucial, as it meant that the plaintiffs did not meet the threshold for appealing to the Privy Council.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of the law governing appeals to the Privy Council. Under this law, an appeal can only be made to the Privy Council if the subject matter of the suit is worth Rs. 10,000 or more, or if the decree involves a claim to property of similar value. The court found that neither of these conditions was met in the present case.

In addition to the above, the court also found that no substantial question of law of general interest or importance was involved in the case. This finding was also crucial, as it meant that even if the plaintiffs had met the threshold for appealing to the Privy Council, their appeal would still have been refused. This is because appeals to the Privy Council are only allowed in cases where a substantial question of law of general interest or importance is involved.

The court's decision to refuse the application for leave to appeal was therefore based on two grounds: firstly, that the subject matter of the suit was not worth Rs. 10,000 or more and did not involve property of similar value, and secondly, that no substantial question of law of general interest or importance was involved in the case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application made by the plaintiffs to appeal to the Privy Council against the judgment of the court that dismissed their suit. The court refused the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that the subject matter of the suit was not worth Rs. 10,000 or more and did not involve property of similar value, and that no substantial question of law of general interest or importance was involved in the case.
