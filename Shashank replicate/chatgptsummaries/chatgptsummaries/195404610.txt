The case in question involved a writ petition filed by the petitioner under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to consider representations and reminders filed by him for taking action against the quarrying and crushing of jelly in Sy.No.216 of Shivapura Village, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District. However, the court found that the petition raised questions of disputed facts and suppressed certain material facts.

The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claims and had failed to disclose certain material facts. The court also observed that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition with no order as to cost.

The court's decision was based on the principle that a writ of mandamus can only be issued when there is a clear legal right and a corresponding duty on the part of the respondent. In this case, the court found that the petitioner had not established a clear legal right and that the respondent did not have a corresponding duty to take action against the quarrying and crushing of jelly in Sy.No.216 of Shivapura Village.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not followed the proper procedure for seeking relief. The court observed that the petitioner should have first approached the local office of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board with all the necessary details. The court, therefore, permitted the petitioner to make an appropriate application with all the necessary details to the local office of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The court found that the petition raised questions of disputed facts and suppressed certain material facts. The court also observed that the petitioner had not established a clear legal right and that the respondent did not have a corresponding duty to take action against the quarrying and crushing of jelly in Sy.No.216 of Shivapura Village. The court, however, permitted the petitioner to make an appropriate application with all the necessary details to the local office of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.
