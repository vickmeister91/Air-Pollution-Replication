The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Mallikarjun Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit. The court found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and allowed the operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court also referred to a similar case where the Division Bench had quashed the closure notice and allowed the petitioner to continue the stone crushing activity till its application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. This indicates that the court has taken a consistent approach in allowing stone crushing activities to continue until the competent authority has considered and disposed of the relevant applications.

The second court order, on the other hand, appears to be a random string of characters and does not contain any meaningful information. It is not possible to summarize this court order as it does not provide any context or details about the case at hand.

Overall, the first court order highlights the importance of following due process and allowing businesses to operate until their applications are considered and disposed of by the relevant authorities. It also emphasizes the need for consistency in judicial decisions, as evidenced by the reference to a similar case where the court had taken a similar approach.
