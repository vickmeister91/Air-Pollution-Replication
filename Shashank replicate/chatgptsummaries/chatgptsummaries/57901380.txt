The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues of pollution and encroachment on water bodies in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. The first order, which was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The second court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state is also directed to provide a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments on the water bodies. The court imposes a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to recover the same from the person. The court also directs the District Collector to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date. The state is warned that if they fail to submit the action plan and scheme, the cost would be imposed.

The third court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in the canals providing drinking water in Sriganganagar. The Divisional Bench constituted a committee to demarcate and remove encroachments and monitor the issue. The State Government was directed to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered the State to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution. The court gave the State Government another opportunity to file a comprehensive compliance report.

The fourth court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has given multiple opportunities to the state authorities to comply with the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and remove encroachments and collect compensation from the encroachers. However, the authorities have been slow in taking action, and the court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief, as it has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The fifth court order discusses a plea of limitation concerning the jurisdiction of the court and the discretion of the court to insist on alternative remedies. The case in question involves an original applicant who filed a petition for writ alleging a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, but the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 was transferred to the tribunal. The tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear all civil cases in which a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The court concludes that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is efficacious and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015 by December 31, 2016. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until December 31, 2016. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the court requests that the NGT consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner(s) sympathetically.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting water bodies and preventing pollution in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. The court has issued various directives to the state authorities to take effective measures to remove encroachments and prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court has also imposed fines on those found contaminating the water and directed the state to recover the same from the person. The court has given multiple opportunities to the state authorities to comply with the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal and remove encroachments and collect compensation from the encroachers. The court has also emphasized the importance of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and suggested that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief.
