The court order in question relates to a writ application filed by M/s Victory Mica Ltd. The company had challenged the rejection of their application for the renewal of a mining lease for Mica. However, the court dismissed the application, citing the mandatory requirement of obtaining approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act for the grant as well as renewal of mining leases in forest areas. This requirement had been established by a previous Supreme Court decision.

The Forest (Conservation) Act was enacted in 1980 to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act requires that any proposal for the diversion of forest land must be approved by the Central Government. This approval is necessary for the grant as well as renewal of mining leases in forest areas.

In the present case, M/s Victory Mica Ltd. had applied for the renewal of a mining lease for Mica. The lease was located in a forest area, and the company had not obtained the necessary approval from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act. The company had argued that the requirement for approval did not apply to the renewal of mining leases. However, the court rejected this argument and held that the requirement applied to both the grant and renewal of mining leases in forest areas.

The court's decision was based on a previous Supreme Court decision in the case of Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India. In that case, the Supreme Court had held that the requirement for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act applied to both the grant and renewal of mining leases in forest areas. The court had also held that the renewal of a mining lease was not a mere continuation of the original lease, but a fresh grant of lease.

The court's decision in the present case has significant implications for mining companies operating in forest areas. It makes it clear that the requirement for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act applies not only to the grant but also to the renewal of mining leases in forest areas. This means that mining companies will have to obtain the necessary approval from the Central Government before applying for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental protection and conservation. The Forest (Conservation) Act was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes and to ensure that such diversion is carried out in a manner that is ecologically sustainable. The court's decision reinforces the need for mining companies to comply with the provisions of the Act and to obtain the necessary approvals before carrying out any mining activities in forest areas.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the present case has clarified the legal position with respect to the renewal of mining leases in forest areas. The court has held that the requirement for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act applies to both the grant and renewal of mining leases in forest areas. This decision has significant implications for mining companies operating in forest areas and reinforces the need for environmental protection and conservation.
