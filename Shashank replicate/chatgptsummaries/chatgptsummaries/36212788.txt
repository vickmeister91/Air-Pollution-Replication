The court order pertains to three different cases, each with its own unique set of circumstances and legal implications. The first case involves a writ petition filed by D. Krishnan and two others against The Federal Bank Ltd. The petitioners had availed a term loan of Rs. 50,00,000/- from the bank for the purpose of repair and renovation of a building. The bank had initially released a sum of Rs. 19,43,900/- for the same. The petitioners requested the bank to disburse the remaining loan amount of Rs. 30,56,100/-, but the bank refused to do so, citing a monetary rival claim between the 1st petitioner and one Mr. Loganathan. The bank issued a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, demanding the petitioners to pay a sum of Rs. 21,23,386/-. The petitioners challenged the notice and sought a direction to the bank to disburse the remaining loan amount. The court ordered a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the notice and directed the bank to disburse the balance loan amount to the petitioners.

The second case discusses the guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India for income recognition, asset classification, and provisioning for banks' advances portfolio. It also defines non-performing assets and specifies the conditions under which an advance can be classified as an NPA. The court refers to previous cases and concludes that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India may be maintainable against a State, Authority, statutory body, instrumentality or agency of the State, a company which is financed and owned by the State, a private body run substantially on State funding, a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature, a person or a body under liability to discharge any function under any Statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory function. However, a private banking company with all freedom that it has, has to act in a manner that it may not be in conflict with or against the fiscal policies of the State and for such purposes, guidelines are provided by the Reserve Bank so that a proper fiscal discipline, to conduct its affairs in carrying on its business, is maintained.

The third case discusses the regulation of financial and commercial activities to maintain fiscal equilibrium and prevent malfunctions in companies involved in banking. Private companies carrying out commercial activities, including banking, cannot be classified as carrying out statutory or public duties, and therefore cannot be subject to writ jurisdiction unless they fail to enforce statutory obligations or obligations of public nature. The court allows an appeal against a writ petition challenging the termination of an employee by a private bank, as the respondent was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the bank. The court also dismisses a writ petition against a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, as writ of certiorari cannot be issued to quash the notice, and mandamus cannot be issued against a scheduled private limited bank.

In the first case, the court ordered The Federal Bank Ltd. to disburse the remaining loan amount to the petitioners, as the bank had no legal grounds to withhold the funds. The bank had cited a monetary rival claim between the 1st petitioner and one Mr. Loganathan as the reason for not disbursing the remaining loan amount. However, the court found that this claim did not have any legal basis and ordered the bank to release the funds to the petitioners. This case highlights the importance of banks adhering to legal guidelines and not withholding funds without proper legal grounds.

The second case discusses the guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India for income recognition, asset classification, and provisioning for banks' advances portfolio. The court emphasizes the importance of private banking companies adhering to these guidelines to maintain fiscal discipline and conduct their affairs in carrying on their business. The court also clarifies that private banking companies cannot be subject to writ jurisdiction unless they fail to enforce statutory obligations or obligations of public nature. This case highlights the importance of private banking companies following legal guidelines and maintaining fiscal discipline.

The third case involves an appeal against a writ petition challenging the termination of an employee by a private bank. The court allows the appeal, as the respondent was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the bank. The court also dismisses a writ petition against a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, as writ of certiorari cannot be issued to quash the notice, and mandamus cannot be issued against a scheduled private limited bank. This case highlights the limitations of writ jurisdiction against private banking companies and the importance of adhering to legal guidelines and obligations.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of private banking companies adhering to legal guidelines and obligations to maintain fiscal discipline and conduct their affairs in carrying on their business. The court clarifies the limitations of writ jurisdiction against private banking companies and emphasizes the importance of following legal guidelines and obligations. These cases serve as a reminder to private banking companies to act in a manner that is not in conflict with or against the fiscal policies of the State and to conduct their affairs in a manner that maintains proper fiscal discipline.
