The court order pertains to a revision filed by the accused, Usman Ghani, against an order declaring him a proclaimed offender in a case under U/s 448/420/506 IPC. The court notes that the impugned order is an interlocutory order and does not decide any valuable right of the accused. The court defines interlocutory order and cites various cases to explain its meaning. The court also notes that the accused did not appear in court despite repeated calls and imposes a cost of Rs. 1800/- on him.

The court ruled that the term "interlocutory order" in Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. refers to orders of a purely interim or temporary nature which do not decide or touch the important rights or the liabilities of the parties. Any order which substantially affects the right of the accused or decides certain rights of the parties cannot be said to be an interlocutory order so as to bar a revision to the High Court against the order. Orders summoning witnesses, adjourning cases, passing orders for bail, calling for reports, and such other steps in aid of the pending proceeding may no doubt amount to interlocutory orders against which no revision would lie under Section 397 (2). But orders which are matters of moment and which affect or adjudicate the rights of the accused or a particular aspect of the trial can not be said to be interlocutory orders so as to be outside the purview of the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court.

The court order states that an exemption granted during trial is an interim order and does not determine the final rights of the parties. The court also cites previous cases where interference with interlocutory orders has contributed to delays in trial. The revision is dismissed as not maintainable and a new offense under IPC section 174A is added. The accused is ordered to pay a cost of Rs. 1800 and the trial court is instructed to ensure its deposition.

In summary, the court order deals with a revision filed by the accused, Usman Ghani, against an order declaring him a proclaimed offender in a case under U/s 448/420/506 IPC. The court notes that the impugned order is an interlocutory order and does not decide any valuable right of the accused. The court defines interlocutory order and cites various cases to explain its meaning.
