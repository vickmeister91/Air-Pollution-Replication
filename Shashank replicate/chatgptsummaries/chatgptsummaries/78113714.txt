In a recent court order, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to preserve the Call Detail Record and call location chart of a mobile phone belonging to the complainant. The application was dismissed by the trial court on the grounds that the call detail record is maintained only for one year. The petitioner filed a revision petition challenging the order, and the court allowed the petition, stating that the trial court should have called a witness from the mobile company to determine if the records were available and if so, directed the company to preserve them until the case was decided.

The case in question pertains to a dispute between the petitioner and the complainant, where the petitioner had requested the preservation of the Call Detail Record and call location chart of the complainant's mobile phone. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to preserve the records, which was dismissed by the trial court on the grounds that the call detail record is maintained only for one year.

The petitioner then filed a revision petition challenging the order of the trial court. The court allowed the petition, stating that the trial court should have called a witness from the mobile company to determine if the records were available and if so, directed the company to preserve them until the case was decided.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial court had not taken into account the possibility that the records may still be available, despite the fact that they are only maintained for one year.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases. The court noted that the preservation of evidence is crucial in ensuring that justice is served and that the guilty are punished.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for trial courts to take a more proactive approach in preserving evidence, rather than simply dismissing applications on technical grounds. The court's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that justice is served and that the guilty are punished.
