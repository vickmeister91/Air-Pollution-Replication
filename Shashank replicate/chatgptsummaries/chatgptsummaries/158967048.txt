The Supreme Court of India heard appeals regarding the establishment and operation of a mechanized slaughterhouse called Alkabeer Abattoir in Rudraram village, Andhra Pradesh. The court order required the state government to prepare a report on the environmental impact and effect on cattle wealth in the area, and submit it to the central government for consideration before making a decision on the establishment of the slaughterhouse.

The Krishnan Committee was formed to examine the matter and reported that the slaughterhouse would require a large number of buffaloes and sheep/goats, leading to a depletion of cattle wealth in the area. The Food and Agriculture department also expressed concerns about the decline in cattle population in the state.

The court order discusses the establishment of a slaughterhouse and the concerns raised by the Food and Agriculture Department regarding the depletion of useful cattle. The court-appointed Krishnan Committee recommended that the slaughterhouse be allowed to operate only if it raised its own feed cattle to minimize the impact on existing cattle wealth. The court ultimately allowed the establishment of the slaughterhouse but with conditions.

The court also criticized the government for not paying attention to the committee's report and for violating the court's directions. The order also discusses various writ petitions filed against the establishment of the slaughterhouse and their dismissal by the court.

In 1993, a court order directed the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) to grant consent to Alkabeer Exports Limited subject to certain conditions. The court also ordered the disposal of a writ petition on its merits in accordance with the law.

The court heard arguments from both sides, with the appellants arguing that the granting of consent by the APPCB was a failure to discharge its duties under the law, and that the location of the factory was contrary to the law. The respondent argued that the slaughterhouse was established in accordance with the law and that safeguards were in place to prevent pollution.

The court found that the Central Government had not complied with the directions of the High Court in its judgment and order dated November 16, 1991, and ordered the Central Government to consider the Krishnan Committee report and pass appropriate orders in the matter. The court also ordered the Central Government to record its opinion in a reasoned proceeding, which would be placed before the court for further orders.

The court has ordered that a report be recorded in a reasoned proceeding and presented to the court. The further orders will depend on the contents of the report and material presented. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case but has indicated the failure of the Central Government to follow directions. Other questions raised by the appellants will be considered later.

The Central Government must submit the report within four months and the appeals will be listed for further hearing after the report is received.

In summary, the court order pertains to the establishment and operation of a mechanized slaughterhouse called Alkabeer Abattoir in Rudraram village, Andhra Pradesh. The court-appointed Krishnan Committee examined the matter and reported that the slaughterhouse would require a large number of buffaloes and sheep/goats, leading to a depletion of cattle wealth in the area. The Food and Agriculture department also expressed concerns about the decline in cattle population in the state.

The court ultimately allowed the establishment of the slaughterhouse but with conditions, including the requirement that the slaughterhouse raise its own feed cattle to minimize the impact on existing cattle wealth. The court also criticized the government for not paying attention to the committee's report and for violating the court's directions.
