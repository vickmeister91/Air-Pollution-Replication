The court order pertains to two separate criminal appeals filed by Santosh Naik against his conviction and sentence for illegal possession of 449.700 kilograms of Ganja. The first appeal was filed against the conviction and sentence of 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000, while the second appeal was filed against the conviction and sentence of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000.

The prosecution's case in both appeals was based on evidence provided by witnesses and the recovery of the contraband from a vehicle driven by the accused. The court found no illegality in the conviction in both appeals and upheld the sentence of 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000 in the first appeal. In the second appeal, the court reduced the jail sentence from 14 years to 10 years, but maintained the fine amount of Rs. 1,00,000 and default sentence. The appellant is to remain in jail until completion of the remaining sentence.

The defense counsel argued for a reduction in the sentence in both appeals, citing the accused's lack of criminal antecedents and his role as a mere carrier. However, the court found the evidence provided by the prosecution to be sufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

In the first appeal, the court noted that the accused was found in possession of a large quantity of Ganja, which is a serious offense under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The court also noted that the accused had not cooperated with the investigation and had not disclosed the source of the contraband. Therefore, the court upheld the sentence of 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000.

In the second appeal, the court noted that the accused had no criminal antecedents and was a mere carrier of the contraband. The court also noted that the accused had been in jail for a considerable period of time and had already served more than four years of the sentence. Therefore, the court reduced the jail sentence from 14 years to 10 years, but maintained the fine amount of Rs. 1,00,000 and default sentence.

Overall, the court order highlights the seriousness of drug offenses under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The court also takes into account the accused's criminal antecedents and role in the offense when determining the appropriate sentence.
