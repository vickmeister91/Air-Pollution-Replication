The court order pertains to a tax dispute between the Commissioner of Income Tax and ACC Rio Tinto Exploration Ltd. The dispute revolves around the applicability of Section 35E of the Income Tax Act, which allows for deductions on expenses related to prospecting and mining of minerals. The court concluded that the provisions of Section 35E would not apply until there is actual commercial production of minerals, and that the assessee was only engaged in prospecting and exploring ores and minerals, not commercial production. Therefore, the addition made by the Assessing Officer was deleted.

The dispute arose when the Assessing Officer made an addition to the income of the assessee, ACC Rio Tinto Exploration Ltd., on account of disallowance of deduction claimed under Section 35E of the Income Tax Act. The Assessing Officer held that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction as it was engaged in prospecting and exploring ores and minerals, and not in commercial production. The assessee challenged the addition before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who upheld the addition. The assessee then appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), which allowed the appeal and deleted the addition. The Revenue then appealed to the High Court.

The High Court examined the provisions of Section 35E of the Income Tax Act and observed that the section provides for a deduction in respect of expenditure incurred on prospecting and exploration of minerals. The court noted that the section uses the phrase "year of commercial production" in sub-section (2), which implies that the deduction is available only after the commencement of commercial production. The court further observed that the phrase "year of commercial production" would be meaningless unless there is actual commercial production.

The court also examined the objects of the company and the permission granted to it for carrying out prospecting and exploration activities. The court noted that the objects of the company were to carry on the business of prospecting, exploring, and mining of minerals, and that the permission granted to it was for prospecting and exploration only. The court concluded that the assessee was not engaged in commercial production of minerals and was only carrying out prospecting and exploration activities. Therefore, the provisions of Section 35E were not applicable to the assessee.

The court also observed that the provisions of Section 35E are not applicable in a case where there is no possibility of commercial production due to the objects of the company and the permission granted to it. The court noted that the assessee was not granted permission for mining and that its objects were limited to prospecting and exploration only. Therefore, the court dismissed the appeal as no substantial question of law arises.

In conclusion, the court order clarifies that the provisions of Section 35E of the Income Tax Act are applicable only after the commencement of commercial production of minerals. The court also clarifies that the provisions of Section 35E are not applicable in a case where there is no possibility of commercial production due to the objects of the company and the permission granted to it. The court's decision provides clarity on the applicability of Section 35E and will have implications for companies engaged in prospecting and exploration activities.
