The case in question pertains to a petitioner who was convicted and sentenced under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. However, due to being sent to judicial custody on the same day as the conviction, the petitioner was unable to file an appeal in time. The petitioner subsequently filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay in filing the appeal, but this was dismissed by the District & Sessions Judge.

The petitioner then approached the court with a revision petition, seeking relief from the dismissal of their application for condonation of delay. The court found that the delay in filing the appeal was only 25 days and that the explanation for the delay was sufficient. As a result, the court allowed the revision petition and remanded the matter back to the District & Sessions Judge for deciding the appeal on its merits.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to protect and preserve the country's wildlife. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and other illegal activities. It is a comprehensive law that seeks to balance the needs of conservation with the interests of local communities and other stakeholders.

In this case, the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced under the Act, but was unable to file an appeal in time due to being sent to judicial custody on the same day as the conviction. The petitioner subsequently filed an application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, which provides for the extension of time limits in certain circumstances.

However, the District & Sessions Judge dismissed the petitioner's application for condonation of delay, prompting the petitioner to approach the court with a revision petition. The court found that the delay in filing the appeal was only 25 days and that the explanation for the delay was sufficient. As a result, the court allowed the revision petition and remanded the matter back to the District & Sessions Judge for deciding the appeal on its merits.

This case highlights the importance of timely filing of appeals and the need for courts to consider the circumstances of each case when deciding on applications for condonation of delay. The court's decision to allow the revision petition and remand the matter back to the District & Sessions Judge for deciding the appeal on its merits is a positive development, as it ensures that the petitioner's case will be heard and decided on its own merits.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and the need for strict enforcement of its provisions. It also underscores the need for courts to be mindful of the circumstances of each case when deciding on applications for condonation of delay, in order to ensure that justice is served.
