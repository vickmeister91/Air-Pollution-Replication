The court order pertains to multiple petitions filed by various organizations and individuals against the State of Maharashtra and others regarding environmental issues. The petitions include Public Interest Litigation and Writ Petitions. The order is modified/corrected by a Speaking to Minutes Order dated 03/09/2015.

One of the court orders pertains to a writ petition filed by Sanstha (Maryadit) Malvani Laxminarayan Sahakari Grihanirman against the State of Maharashtra and others. The petitioners have requested a modification of an order dated 6 October 2005 in Public Interest Litigation No. 86 of 2006 to exclude certain plots in Malvani-Malad and Versova-Andheri. The court lists the specific plots and societies involved in the petition and the respondents' legal representation. The order is an oral judgment delivered on 29 July 2015 by Chief Justice Mohit S. Shah and Justice A.K. Menon.

Another court order pertains to several writ petitions and chamber summonses related to the Bombay Urban Development Project (BUDP) initiated by the Government of Maharashtra in 1985 for the allotment of plots for residential purposes to economically weaker sections and lower-income groups. The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Board (MHADB) prepared complete layout plans for various areas and invited applications from the public and co-operative housing societies for allotment of plots. MHADA allotted plots under the BUDP project to various persons, and the court order refers to the dates of approval of the layout by the Municipal Corporation and the date of allotment of plots in the respective layout. The court order also mentions that the Ministry of Environment and Forest issued a notification in 1991 putting restrictions on construction activities within the Coastal Regulatory Zone, and necessary environmental clearance was required to be obtained. MHADA sent a proposal to the MoEF, and on 10 February 2003, the MoEF granted environmental clearance.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests granted environmental clearance to several housing projects, subject to certain conditions, including the protection of mangroves and the prohibition of untreated sewage discharge into creeks. The clearance was later extended to a residential zone in Malvani-Malad (West) on the same terms and conditions. A writ petition was filed for the protection of mangroves, and the court gave several directions, including a total freeze on the destruction and cutting of mangroves in Maharashtra.

The court order prohibits construction and dumping on mangrove areas in Mumbai and within 50 meters of all sides of mangroves. No development permission will be issued for any area under mangroves, and the Municipal Commissioner of Greater Mumbai must issue directions to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai Building Proposals Department not to entertain any applications for development. The State Government and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority must file monthly reports on the action plan, including the number of complaints received, action taken, number of offenders named, and details of prosecutions/action taken against such offenders. The order also directs the State of Maharashtra to file and furnish copies of maps referred to in an affidavit and identifies areas shown as mangrove areas in a satellite study report as part of Phase I of mapping by the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre. The order also outlines steps for identifying and declaring government-owned and privately-owned mangrove areas as protected forests or forests, updating revenue records, and taking necessary steps for protection, conservation, and regeneration of the areas.

The court order requires necessary steps for protection, conservation, and regeneration of areas that would be declared as "protected forests." This includes removing obstructions that impede mangrove growth, rejuvenating sparse and denuded areas, removing garbage and debris, and taking action against offenders who damage or destroy mangroves. Officers designated for this purpose must submit a report every three months. The State Government must provide necessary staff and funds, and the Principal Secretaries of Environment, Revenue, and Forest Departments are responsible for ensuring compliance. The order modifies a previous court order and directs the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra to send a circular to ensure compliance. MHADA has sought exemption from the order for certain lands.

The court order excludes certain lands from a previous judgment and order regarding a housing project in Mumbai. The MHADA had launched a project in 1985 to provide affordable housing to the economically weaker sections and lower income groups. The PIL petitioner questions whether the development permitted on the plots within a 50-meter buffer zone is governed by the CRZ Notification dated 6 January 2011. The relevant provisions of the CRZ Notification are reproduced in the order. The CRZ area is classified into CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III, and CRZ-IV. Areas falling within 50 meters of the buffer zone shall fall in CRZ-I, and no construction activity is permitted in CRZ-I except for specified categories of construction.

The court order discusses the classification of coastal regulation zones (CRZ) in India and the guidelines for protecting the critical coastal environment. The court directed the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) to submit a report on whether certain plots fall within the buffer zone of 50 meters from the mangroves and whether the mangrove area near the plots is 1000 sq.meters or larger. The court also considered arguments from MHADA and other parties regarding whether the plots fall
