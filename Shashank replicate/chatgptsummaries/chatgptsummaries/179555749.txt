The case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioners against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.2, Udaipur, in Criminal Revision No.5/2017. The trial court had partly allowed an application filed by respondent No.2 under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and directed the SHO, Police Station Ghantaghar, District Udaipur to produce certain documents before passing any final order on the FR submitted by the police as well as on the protest petition filed by the respondent No.2.

The petitioners argued that the trial court had erred in partly allowing the application filed by respondent No.2 under Section 91 Cr.P.C. They contended that the order was illegal and that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing it. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that there was no illegality in the order passed by the trial court.

The issue at hand is whether the trial court had erred in partly allowing the application filed by respondent No.2 under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioners argued that the order was illegal and that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing it. However, the court disagreed and dismissed the petition.

Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing if it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In the present case, respondent No.2 had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking the production of certain documents before the trial court passed any final order on the FR submitted by the police as well as on the protest petition filed by respondent No.2.

The trial court had partly allowed the application filed by respondent No.2 and directed the SHO, Police Station Ghantaghar, District Udaipur to produce the documents in question. The petitioners had challenged this order on the grounds that it was illegal and that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing it.

However, the court disagreed with the petitioners and held that there was no illegality in the order passed by the trial court. The court noted that the trial court had the power to direct the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. if it was necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The court also noted that the trial court had not exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the order. The court held that the trial court had the power to pass any order that was necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court further held that the trial court had acted within its jurisdiction in passing the order.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioners against the order passed by the trial court. The court held that there was no illegality in the order passed by the trial court and that the trial court had acted within its jurisdiction in passing the order. The court also noted that the trial court had the power to pass any order that was necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.
