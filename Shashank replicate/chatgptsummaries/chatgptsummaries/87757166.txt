The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the sealing of a commercial building in New Delhi by the Monitoring Committee due to alleged misuse of the property. The LGF Occupants Association appealed against the order, arguing that it was illegal and violated natural justice. They claimed that the Monitoring Committee's scope was limited to recommending action for misuse of residential premises and that the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in IA No. 22 was not applicable to their purely commercial property. The association further argued that the public notice was published before the premises were sealed and that the building had all necessary sanctions and approvals from development authorities.

The appeal was heard by the District & Sessions Judge, who reserved judgment on August 10, 2016. The court heard arguments from both parties regarding the sealing of the appellant's premises. The appellant argued that the public notice used to seal the premises was void and infructuous due to changes in the Master Plan 2021 and subsequent amendments. The NDMC argued that the premises were sealed due to the appellant's violation of the law by running professional offices in a building sanctioned for storage. The court also considered the appellant's argument that a nearby building was allowed to operate professional activities. The court noted that the commercial use of the basement for offices and shops is not against the law and that the building had all necessary sanctions and approvals. The court ordered the NDMC to reconsider the sealing of the premises.

In another court order, the court discussed the unauthorized use of a basement in a commercial building in Delhi. The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) failed to recognize that the building bylaws permit the use of the basement for commercial purposes if it is air-conditioned storage and part of the floor area ratio (FAR). The building has several deviations from the sanctioned plan, and the entire building has not been constructed as per the plan. The Monitoring Committee ordered the sealing of the property due to misuse, and the appellant association challenged the validity of the notice. The court ruled that the nomenclature of the property cannot be changed as per the wishes of the seller or buyer, and the basement must be used strictly according to the sanctioned plan. The mutation in house tax records and the length of occupancy by the appellant cannot legalize the misuse of the property.

In the third court order, the court stated that even if there is a mutation in the house tax record and the property has been occupied for a long time, it does not legalize the misuse of the property. The appellant has concealed material facts from the court, and there are deviations from the sanctioned building plan and unauthorized construction on each floor, including sealed portions. The Monitoring Committee rightly passed an order for sealing the property on account of misuse. The plea of the appellant that no notice was given to it or that notice was given three years prior cannot be treated as a notice. The court finds no infirmity in the impugned order and upholds and confirms it. The appeal stands dismissed on all grounds.

In summary, the court orders discussed the sealing of a commercial building in New Delhi due to alleged misuse of the property. The LGF Occupants Association appealed against the order, arguing that it was illegal and violated natural justice. The court heard arguments from both parties and ordered the NDMC to reconsider the sealing of the premises. However, in another court order, the court ruled that the nomenclature of the property cannot be changed as per the wishes of the seller or buyer, and the basement must be used strictly according to the sanctioned plan. The court also stated that even if there is a mutation in the house tax record and the property has been occupied for a long time, it does not legalize the misuse of the property. The Monitoring Committee rightly passed an order for sealing the property on account of misuse, and the appeal stands dismissed on all grounds.
