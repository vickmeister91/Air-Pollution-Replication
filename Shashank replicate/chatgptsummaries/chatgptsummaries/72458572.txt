The court has sentenced him to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. However, Ravi Singh has filed an application for suspension of sentence and exemption from filing typed copies.

The court has allowed the exemption and admitted the revision for hearing. This means that Ravi Singh will not be required to file typed copies of the documents related to his case.

Ravi Singh's conviction under this act suggests that he has violated one or more of its provisions. The court's decision to sentence him to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 indicates that the offence was serious.

The court's decision to allow the application for suspension of sentence, but with conditions, suggests that it is taking a cautious approach. By requiring Ravi Singh to deposit the fine amount and furnish a bail bond, the court is ensuring that he will comply with its orders and appear for the final hearing.
