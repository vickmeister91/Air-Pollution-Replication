The court order pertains to four different cases, each with its unique set of circumstances and legal issues. The first case involves a writ petition filed by M/s Himanchal Construction Company Private Limited against the State of Jharkhand. The petitioner had filed a money suit claiming Rs. 10,17,45,402/- along with interest and cost of suit. The petitioner had sought to amend the suit by invoking the jurisdiction of the Court as conferred under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC. The trial court had rejected the amendment petition on the ground of delay. The petitioner had challenged this order in the writ petition.

The court reflects on the provision of Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, which allows for amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, subject to certain conditions. The court assesses the factual aspect of the case and concludes that the trial court's decision was legal and proper. The petitioner had filed multiple amendment petitions, and the documents sought to be incorporated were obtained under RTI after a delay of almost two years. The court emphasizes that while amendments are allowed to avoid multiplicity of litigations, they cannot be claimed as a matter of right and should not cause irretrievable prejudice to the other side.

In the second case, the court discusses a petition for amendment of pleadings in a money suit. The petitioner sought to incorporate certain documents in the plaint, but the trial court dismissed the petition on the grounds of delay and lack of due diligence. The court allows the amendments as they do not change the nature and character of the suit and do not cause prejudice to the defendant. The court reflects on the provision of Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, which allows for amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, subject to certain conditions. The court emphasizes that while amendments are allowed to avoid multiplicity of litigations, they cannot be claimed as a matter of right and should not cause irretrievable prejudice to the other side.

The third case involves a dispute over the revocation of a bank guarantee without the plaintiff's consent and depositing the amount in the defendant's bank accounts, causing heavy losses to the plaintiff. The court finds that the defendants were wrong in revoking the bank guarantee without the plaintiff's consent and orders them to pay the plaintiff the amount with interest and other losses. The order also includes references to previous court cases and amendments sought by the plaintiff to incorporate government circulars in the plaint. The court allows the amendments as they do not change the nature and character of the suit and do not cause prejudice to the defendant.

In the fourth case, the court allows an amendment to be made to the pleading for proper adjudication of the issues raised by the parties. The court believes that the documents sought to be incorporated have a direct nexus with the pleading made in the plaint. The court sets aside the impugned order and allows the amendment petition. The court also provides an opportunity for the defendants to file additional evidence if they wish. The writ petition is allowed and stands disposed of.

In all four cases, the court emphasizes the importance of due diligence and the need to avoid causing irretrievable prejudice to the other side while seeking amendments to pleadings. The court also reflects on the provisions of Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, which allows for amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, subject to certain conditions. The court's orders reflect a balanced approach to the legal issues involved and seek to ensure that justice is done to all parties involved.
