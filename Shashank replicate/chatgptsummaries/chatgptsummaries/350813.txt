The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues related to quarrying operations in India. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by villagers seeking to quash a quarrying lease granted to the sixth respondent by the third respondent. The petitioners argue that the land in question was originally meant for cattle grazing and that the quarrying operations have adversely impacted the environment and caused damage to houses in the village. The respondents argue that the lease was granted after due process and that the quarrying operations have provided employment to villagers. The court considers the arguments of both sides and examines relevant rules and regulations before deciding on the matter.

The court order emphasizes the importance of following the rules and regulations set forth by the Karnataka Land Revenue Act and the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules. The court notes the potential environmental hazards caused by quarrying operations and the responsibility of miners to comply with environmental protection laws. The court cites the concept of sustainable development and the precautionary principle in making decisions that prioritize environmental protection over economic interests.

The court also discusses the need for precautions to protect the environment and control pollution during mining operations. The court suggests short and long-term actions for restoring environmental quality and monitoring air, water, and noise pollution. The court also notes instances where mining operations have caused damage to the environment and nearby communities, leading to closure of mining operations. The court relies on reports and photographs to support its decision to cancel the mining license and remove machinery from the quarry lease area.

In another court order, the court discusses a challenge to the cancellation of a quarry lease due to non-payment of royalty. The revisional authority focused only on the non-payment of royalty and did not consider the reasons for the cancellation of the license. The court found that the revisional authority did not apply its mind to the reason for cancellation and that monetary compensation is not the remedy in such cases. The court also considered the concerns of people living near mines or quarries and ordered that the authority which issued licenses for quarries in the area should consider the impact on the environment and nearby residents.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following rules and regulations related to quarrying operations and the need to prioritize environmental protection over economic interests. The court also emphasizes the need to consider the impact of mining operations on nearby communities and the environment. These court orders serve as a reminder to all stakeholders involved in quarrying operations to act responsibly and take necessary precautions to protect the environment and nearby communities.
