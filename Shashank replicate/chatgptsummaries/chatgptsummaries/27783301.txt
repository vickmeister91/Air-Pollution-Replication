In December 2012, the Karnataka High Court issued a court order in response to Writ Petition Nos. 51900-51901 of 2012 (GM-MMS) filed by Maleek Stone Crusher & Metal Industries and Syed Sadath Stone Crusher. The petitioners sought a writ of certiorari to quash closure notices issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court allowed the petitions and quashed the closure notices, directing the respondents to permit the operation of the stone crushing units of the petitioners at the present site till such time their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the closure notices were issued without giving the petitioners an opportunity to be heard. The court held that the principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them.

The court also noted that the petitioners had applied for renewal of their licenses and that the licensing authority had not yet taken a decision on their applications. The court held that the petitioners should be allowed to continue their operations until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority.

The court's decision was welcomed by the petitioners, who had argued that the closure notices had caused them significant financial losses. The court's decision allowed them to resume their operations and continue their business.

The court's decision was also significant because it reaffirmed the importance of the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making. The court held that the right to be heard is a fundamental right and that it cannot be denied without violating the principles of natural justice.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was a victory for the petitioners and for the principles of natural justice. The court's decision ensured that the petitioners were given a fair hearing and that their rights were protected. The decision also reaffirmed the importance of the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making.
