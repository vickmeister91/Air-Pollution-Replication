The Jharkhand High Court has issued an order for two petitioners to surrender within two weeks in connection with a case registered under Sections 379 of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 4, 21 of the Pollution Control Act and Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The court has directed that the petitioners be released on bail upon surrendering and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribag, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C.

The case in question involves allegations of theft of forest produce and illegal transportation of the same. The petitioners had approached the High Court seeking anticipatory bail, which was denied by the court. The court observed that the allegations against the petitioners were serious in nature and that the investigation was still ongoing. The court further noted that the petitioners had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to appear before the investigating officer despite being summoned.

The court, while denying anticipatory bail, directed the petitioners to surrender before the trial court within two weeks. The court also directed that the petitioners be released on bail upon surrendering and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribag, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C.

Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. deals with anticipatory bail. It allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. However, the grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions. Section 438(2) lays down the conditions that must be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. These conditions include that the person must cooperate with the investigation, must not tamper with evidence, and must not commit any offence while on bail.

In this case, the court found that the petitioners had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to appear before the investigating officer despite being summoned. The court, therefore, denied anticipatory bail and directed the petitioners to surrender before the trial court within two weeks.

The court also directed that the petitioners be released on bail upon surrendering and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribag, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C. This means that the petitioners will have to surrender before the trial court and furnish bail bonds with sureties before they can be released on bail.

The court's order is significant as it emphasizes the importance of cooperation with the investigation. The court has made it clear that failure to cooperate with the investigation can have serious consequences, including the denial of anticipatory bail. The court's order also highlights the importance of following the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C. while seeking anticipatory bail.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court has ordered two petitioners to surrender within two weeks in connection with a case registered under Sections 379 of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 4, 21 of the Pollution Control Act and Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The court has directed that the petitioners be released on bail upon surrendering and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribag, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C. The court's order emphasizes the importance of cooperation with the investigation and following the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Cr.P.C. while seeking anticipatory bail.
