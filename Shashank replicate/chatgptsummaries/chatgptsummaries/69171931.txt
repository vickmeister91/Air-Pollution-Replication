The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two writ petitions filed by M/S H R Industries and M/S Janukal Stone Industries against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners are stone crushing units that operate under a valid license issued by the competent authority. They sought a writ of certiorari to quash the closure notices issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider their applications to operate their crushing units.

The court found that the orders impugned in the writ petitions were similar to those in a previous writ action and quashed the closure notices. The court allowed the petitioners to continue operating their crushing units at the present site until their applications were considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court order is significant as it provides relief to the petitioners who were facing closure of their crushing units due to the closure notices issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board. The court found that the orders impugned in the writ petitions were similar to those in a previous writ action and quashed the closure notices. This decision is likely to have a positive impact on other stone crushing units that are facing similar closure notices.

The court also directed the competent authority to consider the applications of the petitioners to operate their crushing units. This is an important direction as it ensures that the petitioners are given a fair chance to operate their crushing units in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

The court order also allows the petitioners to continue operating their crushing units at the present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. This is a significant relief for the petitioners as it allows them to continue their operations without any interruption.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the stone crushing industry in Karnataka. It provides relief to the petitioners who were facing closure of their crushing units and ensures that they are given a fair chance to operate their units in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. The court order is likely to have a positive impact on other stone crushing units that are facing similar closure notices.
