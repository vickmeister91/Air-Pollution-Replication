The Madras High Court recently heard a Writ Petition filed by K. Jaganathan, the proprietor of M/s. K.J. Metal Industries, challenging the order of closure and disconnection of electricity service connection to his business premises by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The petitioner stated that he intended to discontinue industrial operations at the present site and relocate to a new location, using the present site as a godown unit. The court granted permission for the removal of all machinery and equipment from the present site and directed the respondent/TANGEDCO to provide electricity service connection to the petitioner's present unit until March 31, 2018.

The case was heard by Justice T. Raja, who considered the arguments of both parties before making a decision. The petitioner argued that he had already obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for the relocation of his business to a new site. He also stated that he had paid all the necessary fees and charges for the disconnection of electricity service connection to his present unit.

The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the closure and disconnection of electricity service connection was necessary to prevent further pollution and environmental damage caused by the petitioner's industrial operations. The respondent also argued that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary clearances and approvals from the local authorities for the relocation of his business to a new site.

After considering the arguments of both parties, the court granted permission for the removal of all machinery and equipment from the present site. The court also directed the respondent/TANGEDCO to provide electricity service connection to the petitioner's present unit until March 31, 2018. The court noted that the petitioner had already obtained a NOC from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for the relocation of his business to a new site. The court also noted that the petitioner had paid all the necessary fees and charges for the disconnection of electricity service connection to his present unit.

The court further directed the petitioner to submit a compliance report to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board within two weeks of the removal of all machinery and equipment from the present site. The compliance report should include details of the relocation of the petitioner's business to a new site and the measures taken to prevent pollution and environmental damage at the new site.

The court's decision is significant as it balances the interests of both parties. The petitioner is allowed to relocate his business to a new site, while the respondent is assured that the closure and disconnection of electricity service connection to the present unit will prevent further pollution and environmental damage. The court's direction for the submission of a compliance report also ensures that the petitioner takes necessary measures to prevent pollution and environmental damage at the new site.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in the Writ Petition filed by K. Jaganathan, the proprietor of M/s. K.J. Metal Industries, is a balanced and fair decision that takes into account the interests of both parties. The court's direction for the submission of a compliance report also ensures that the petitioner takes necessary measures to prevent pollution and environmental damage at the new site.
