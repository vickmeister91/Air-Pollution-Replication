The court heard multiple writ petitions filed by a member of the Central Armed Police Service who was approved for promotion to the rank of Inspector General of Central Reserve Police Force (IG CRPF) but had his formal promotion order withheld due to a medical report stating he was not medically fit. The petitioner challenged his transfer orders and subsequent withdrawal of his promotion order, alleging mala fide exercise of power and violation of Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India and principles of natural justice. The respondents argued that the petitioner consistently graded as SHAPE-2 or SHAPE-3 by six different medical boards, making him unfit for promotion.

The court order discusses the guidelines and procedures for medical examinations and classifications of personnel in Central Para Military Forces. It also mentions the petitioner's medical examination results, which categorized him as unfit for promotion due to his diabetes and hypertension. The court notes that the petitioner had suppressed this information in his writ petition and had exhausted his remedy of appeal against the medical report. The court also cites a note from the Home Secretary, which explains the circumstances under which the petitioner was placed in the P3 medical category. Overall, the court order clarifies the importance of medical examinations and classifications in determining eligibility for promotion in the Central Para Military Forces.

The court found that the respondents did not commit any illegality in subjecting the medical report to the parameters provided in the Standing Order No. 04/2008, which governs the medical examination of force personnel and determination of their medical category. The petitioner argued that he could not be demoted without recourse to the procedure mandated by Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India and without being given an opportunity to be heard. However, the court order states that the petitioner cannot be demoted or reverted without following the procedure mandated by the Constitution of India and giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

In another case, the petitioner was found unfit for promotion due to his medical condition. The petitioner underwent multiple medical examinations, including a review medical board and a special medical board, but was consistently found unfit for promotion. The petitioner made false statements and attempted to mislead the Home Secretary during an interview. The petitioner also alleged tampering of his medical examination report, but the court found that the report was not relevant to the promotion decision. The court ultimately concluded that the petitioner was not eligible for promotion due to his medical condition and that his promotion order was withdrawn.

The court order discusses a case involving a petitioner who had made incorrect medical declarations and had his medical category changed from P-3 to P-2. The petitioner underwent multiple medical examinations and was eventually categorized as P-2. The order also discusses the Standing Order No. 04/2008, which governs the medical examination of force personnel and determination of their medical category. The petitioner claimed that the orders against him were penalty acts due to malice, but the respondent argued that they were correcting an illegality. The court found that the petitioner had enough opportunities to demonstrate his medical condition and that the impugned orders were rightly revoked. The court dismisses the petition and the plea of mala fides and malice.

In another case, the petitioner had challenged orders related to a medical examination and temporary placement with Training Dte CRPF. The Ministry of Home Affairs had directed the petitioner to undergo a medical examination at AIIMS, and if he passed, he would be promoted to IG retrospectively. The petitioner can still undergo the medical examination within 15 days and request it in writing. The court has disposed of the writ petition and provided copies of the judgment to the relevant parties. No costs were ordered.

In summary, the court heard multiple cases related to medical examinations and classifications of personnel in Central Para Military Forces. The court emphasized the importance of medical examinations in determining eligibility for promotion and clarified the procedures for medical examinations and classifications. The court also found that petitioners cannot be demoted or reverted without following the procedure mandated by the Constitution of India and giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard. The court dismissed petitions alleging mala fides and malice and provided opportunities for petitioners to undergo medical examinations and request promotions.
