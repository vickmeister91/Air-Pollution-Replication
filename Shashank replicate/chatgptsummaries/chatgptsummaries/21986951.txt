The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by M. Laxman Hegde against M/s. Hosathota Arecanut Co. The petitioner is facing proceedings for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. During the evidence of the complainant, he had admitted that there is no account maintained by the complainant for the petitioner. 

On a subsequent date of hearing, the complainant witness had chosen to produce certain additional documents showing that there were transactions between the petitioner and the complainant with reference to certain documents of the Income Tax Department. The petitioner had made an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking that the said documents which were in the custody of the Income Tax Department should be summoned in order to test the veracity of the documents that were produced by the complainant. That application having been rejected, the present petition is filed.

The court held that since the complainant has already admitted that there were no transactions between the complainant and the present petitioner, the subsequent production of documents without an explanation that he had committed a mistake in stating that there were no transactions and that there were indeed transactions between the complainant and the respondent is evidenced by the documents thereafter produced would not advance the case of the complainant. Therefore, the petition is disposed of without prejudice to the case of the petitioner.
