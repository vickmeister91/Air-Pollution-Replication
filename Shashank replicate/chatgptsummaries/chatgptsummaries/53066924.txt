The court recently rejected the bail application of Ramkaran, who was facing charges under the Rajasthan Forest and Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Amendment Act, 1991. The petitioner had a history of jumping bail, having done so five times previously. As a result, the court deemed it necessary to deny his bail application.

The case against Ramkaran is related to the illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife in the state of Rajasthan. The Rajasthan Forest and Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Amendment Act, 1991, are designed to protect the state's wildlife and natural resources. The charges against Ramkaran are serious, and the court deemed it necessary to deny his bail application to ensure that he would not be able to continue his illegal activities.

The court also directed the trial court to expedite the disposal of the case. This means that the trial court will be required to move quickly to hear and decide the case against Ramkaran. The court's decision to expedite the disposal of the case is likely due to the seriousness of the charges against Ramkaran and the need to ensure that justice is served in a timely manner.

Overall, the court's decision to deny Ramkaran's bail application and expedite the disposal of the case sends a strong message that illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife will not be tolerated in the state of Rajasthan. The court's decision also serves as a warning to others who may be engaging in similar activities that they will be held accountable for their actions and will face serious consequences if they are caught.
