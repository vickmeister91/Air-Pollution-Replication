Roche Products (India) Pvt Ltd filed a suit for injunction against Drugs Controller General of India and others, which was listed before the court along with an interim application on 5th February 2014. The interim application was modified on 14th February 2014, and the remaining interim order already passed would continue. During the pendency of the hearing, both parties filed large numbers of applications, and the hearing of rejoinder arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs was stuck due to subsequent events in the matter. The plaintiffs filed a fresh application for amendment of the plaint as well as a fresh application for passing the interim order. The plaintiffs apprehended that the defendants may launch the drug for two additional indications, i.e. Early Breast Cancer and Metastatic Gastric Cancer for Trastuzumab, approval of which was granted to defendant No.2 by defendant No.1 by letter dated 17th March 2015, and another approval for the Carton, Labels and Package Insert on 28th July 2015. The plaintiffs sought an interim order against the defendants.

The court order discusses a case where the plaintiffs are seeking an injunction against the defendants from launching, introducing, selling, marketing, distributing, or representing their biosimilar version of Trastuzumab in the Indian market until appropriate tests and studies have been conducted and appropriate approvals have been obtained. The defendants have obtained approval for two additional indications without disclosing this information to the court. The court has not granted an interim order to launch the drug for the additional indications, and the objections of the plaintiffs on merit will be decided at the time of passing orders in the earlier interim applications. The court has also noted that the defendants have not disclosed vital information to the court and have reproduced the data of the plaintiffs for public announcement despite interim orders against them.

The court order states that despite interim orders against the defendants, defendant No.2 filed an application for two additional indications and reproduced the plaintiffs' references in the Package Insert. The defendants were allowed to use the Package Insert for the first indication, but the plaintiffs deny approval for the insert used by defendant No.2 to 4. The court finds that the approval of Carton, Labels, and Package Insert was granted contrary to the interim order and that defendant No.2's conduct was improper. The court passes an interim order against the reproduction of data for information to the public until the pending interim applications are decided on merit. The court clarifies that defendant No.2 can use different data in the Package Insert that is not contrary to the interim orders already granted.

The court order states that the drug CANMAb can now be prescribed for two additional indications, but the composition of the drug cannot be changed. The defendants are also not allowed to use the plaintiffs' trade marks in any press release or public announcement for their product. The plaintiffs argue that the approval for additional indications is in violation of interim orders and that the defendants did not conduct necessary testing for the new indications. The court has reserved its decision on the matter.

In summary, Roche Products (India) Pvt Ltd filed a suit for injunction against Drugs Controller General of India and others, seeking to prevent the defendants from launching, introducing, selling, marketing, distributing, or representing their biosimilar version of Trastuzumab in the Indian market until appropriate tests and studies have been conducted and appropriate approvals have been obtained. The plaintiffs also sought an interim order against the defendants, fearing that they may launch the drug for two additional indications without conducting necessary testing for the new indications.
