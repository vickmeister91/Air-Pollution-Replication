The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a revision petition challenging a Sessions Judge's order to remand a case to a Magistrate for further proceedings against two accused persons who were allegedly running a sugar factory and discharging effluents in contravention of the Water (Prevention and Control on Pollution) Act, 1974. The accused persons argued that the complaint was not made by the State Board or with its previous sanction in writing, as mandated by Section 49 of the Act. The Court allowed the accused persons to raise this contention and ultimately held that the complaint was not made "by" the State Board, as there was no resolution by the Board to file the complaint. Therefore, the Court held that the Magistrate could not have taken cognizance of the case, and the complaint was invalid.

The court order states that any offense under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, can only be prosecuted in the manner prescribed in Section 49, which requires a complaint made by the State Board or with previous written sanction from the State Board. In this case, there was no previous written sanction, so the complaint was not valid. Therefore, the present revision is allowed, and the impugned order is set aside, and the Magistrate's order is restored for a different reason.
