The court order in question pertains to a second bail application filed by Vijendra Joshi under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for the grant of bail. Joshi had been arrested in connection with a case registered at Police Station Jora, District Morena for the offence punishable under Sections 366, 376, 376(2) (E), 376(D) and 363 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO).

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the bail application and directed Joshi to furnish a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/- with two solvent sureties of Rs.50,000/- each to the satisfaction of the trial court. The bail was granted on the condition that Joshi shall remain present before the court concerned during the trial and shall also comply with the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C.

The case against Joshi pertains to allegations of sexual assault and kidnapping of a minor girl. The prosecution had opposed the bail application on the grounds that Joshi was a flight risk and that he may tamper with the evidence if released on bail. However, the court found that there were no grounds to deny bail to Joshi and that he had already been in custody for a considerable period of time.

The court also noted that the investigation in the case was complete and that the charge sheet had already been filed. The court further observed that the trial was likely to take some time and that Joshi had no criminal antecedents. The court, therefore, granted bail to Joshi on the conditions mentioned above.

The order of the court is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting the rights of the accused while ensuring that justice is served. The court, in this case, has balanced the interests of the accused and the prosecution and has granted bail to Joshi on reasonable conditions.

It is important to note that bail is not a right but a privilege granted to an accused person. The court, while granting bail, takes into consideration various factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of the accused tampering with the evidence.

In this case, the court has found that there were no grounds to deny bail to Joshi and that he had already been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the investigation in the case was complete and that the charge sheet had already been filed.

The court has, therefore, granted bail to Joshi on the condition that he shall remain present before the court concerned during the trial and shall also comply with the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C. This order of the court is a reminder that the rights of the accused must be protected while ensuring that justice is served.
