The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by petitioners who challenged the legality, validity, and correctness of an order passed by the Board of Revenue. The Board of Revenue had affirmed the order of the Commissioner, which had set aside the sale made by the original holders in favor of the petitioners and vested the land in favor of the government. The court heard both cases together and found that the lands in dispute were recorded as bade jhad ka jangal and reserved for nistari jangal, and the said lands had been allotted in violation of the provisions contained in Section 158(3) as well as Section 165(7)(b) of the Code of 1959. Therefore, the court upheld the orders passed by the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue.

In the second court order, the violation of clause 7 of a lease deed by the original grantees who transferred allotted lands in violation of the clause was discussed. The land in dispute was recorded as bade jhad ka jangal in revenue records. The court considered whether forest land can be allotted or leased without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court cited the Supreme Court's ruling that the term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of ownership. The court also noted that prior approval is required for the diversion of any forest land and its use for some other purpose.

The third court order stated that once an area is declared as protected forest, it becomes forest within the meaning of Section 2 of the Act of 1980 and prior approval of the Central Government is a condition precedent for grant of lease. The State Government or any authority cannot make an order or issue direction for de-reservation of reserved forest or permit for the use of forest land or any portion thereof by way of lease without obtaining prior approval of the Central Government. Bade jhad ka jangal cannot be allotted by State authorities without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court declared the transactions null and void and vested the lands in favor of the government.

In summary, the court orders dealt with the illegal allotment of forest land without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court upheld the orders passed by the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue, declared the transactions null and void, and vested the lands in favor of the government. The court also noted that once an area is declared as protected forest, it becomes forest within the meaning of Section 2 of the Act of 1980 and prior approval of the Central Government is a condition precedent for grant of lease. The State Government or any authority cannot make an order or issue direction for de-reservation of reserved forest or permit for the use of forest land or any portion thereof by way of lease without obtaining prior approval of the Central Government.
