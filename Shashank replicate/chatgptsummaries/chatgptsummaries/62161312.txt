The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court has heard several writ petitions claiming relief from an illegal demand notice for compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The petitioner had already deposited compensation for the land diversion, but the government demanded additional compensation under a new policy. The court reviewed the policy and found that the government was entitled to demand the compensation, and therefore dismissed the writ petitions.

Another dispute between mining lease holders and the Forest Department regarding the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land was also addressed in the court order. The petitioners argued that they were being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and also for the common area, which is being utilized commonly by the cluster members. They also argued that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argued that the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster show that only 63 mining lease holders including the petitioner deposited the said amount and rest of them out of total 136, either surrendered their leases or their leases were cancelled with the land lying unutilized with the Mining Department.

The court order also pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

In another dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, the court found that the mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and only the extension proposal for the rest of the mining leases was submitted. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

Overall, the court order addresses multiple disputes between mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare. The court has also dismissed writ petitions claiming relief from an illegal demand notice for compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining activities.
