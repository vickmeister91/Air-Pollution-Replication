The Madras High Court recently heard a case between MRF Ltd and MRF Thozhilalar Sangham. The MRF Employees Union had filed several writ petitions against MRF Ltd for terminating workers and hiring new ones. The court found that MRF's actions violated the workers' statutory rights and ordered them to reinstate the terminated workers with full back wages. However, MRF appealed the decision, arguing that the writ petitions were not maintainable against a private company. The court did not discuss all the claims and counterclaims but noted that industrial peace had been restored during the case's pendency.

The court order discusses a case involving the MRF company and its workers. The court restored industrial peace by reinstating some workers and confirming their employment, while others were terminated. The court also discussed the maintainability of writ petitions against private companies and the legality of termination under the Industrial Disputes Act. The court allowed the reinstatement of ten workers as probationers for one year and suggested that the union raise an industrial dispute for the remaining workers. The court modified the order of the single judge and disposed of the writ appeals with no order as to costs. The court also rejected a petition to cancel the registration of the MRF Employees Union.

The court order pertains to a dispute between two trade unions, MRF Thozhilaalar Sangam and MRF Employees Union, in Pondicherry. The Labour Department of the Government of Pondicherry rejected a petition by MRF Thozhilaalar Sangam to cancel the registration of MRF Employees Union. The court stated that it cannot determine the genuineness of either union and allowed the aggrieved party to seek appropriate relief through the appropriate forum. The court disposed of the case with no order as to costs.
