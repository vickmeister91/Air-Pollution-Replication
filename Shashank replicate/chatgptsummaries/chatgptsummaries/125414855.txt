The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by G. Janaki against C. Arasukumar, seeking to condone the delay of 122 days in filing a criminal revision against an order passed by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner claimed that the respondent had used forged documents in a case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and had failed to explain the different signatures in the pro-note. 

The petitioner had filed a petition seeking an expert opinion, which was dismissed by the trial court. The petitioner claimed that due to health and family problems, they could not contact their lawyer and obtain a copy of the order, resulting in the delay. The respondent argued that the petitioner had been dilatory in their tactics and had admitted to the execution of the cheque in question. 

The court ultimately dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner lacked bona-fides and had not satisfactorily explained the delay. The court found that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their claim of health and family problems, and that the delay was due to their own negligence. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their claim of forgery, and that the respondent had provided a plausible explanation for the different signatures on the pro-note.

The court further noted that the petitioner had admitted to the execution of the cheque in question, and that the delay in filing the criminal revision was a deliberate tactic to delay the proceedings. The court found that the petitioner lacked bona-fides and had not satisfactorily explained the delay, and therefore dismissed the petition.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in court, and the need for litigants to act in good faith and not engage in dilatory tactics. The court's decision also underscores the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for litigants to take responsibility for their own actions. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to litigants to act in good faith and to provide evidence to support their claims. It also highlights the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for litigants to take responsibility for their own actions.
