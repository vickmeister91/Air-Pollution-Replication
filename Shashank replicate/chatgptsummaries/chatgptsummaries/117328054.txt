The Punjab-Haryana High Court has heard several cases related to mining contracts in the state of Punjab. The court order lists the names of the petitioners and respondents and the lawyers representing them. The lead case is CWP No.12664 of 2017 titled Baljit Singh Vs. State of Punjab. The petitioners claim that the state has asked them to either surrender their existing contracts or execute a fresh contract at the rate at which mines within the districts have been given for prospecting of minor minerals by auction through 'progressive bidding'. The judgment will decide on the common questions of fact and law arising in these writ petitions.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the use of "progressive bidding" versus "reverse bidding" in the auction of mining contracts in the state of Punjab, India. The Director of Mining, Industries and Commerce Department issued a letter directing successful contractors to change their existing contracts to progressive bidding or surrender them in accordance with the Punjab Minor Minerals Rules. The State argues that the change is necessary to curb illegal mining and maximize state revenue, while the petitioners argue that the change is arbitrary and violates their legitimate expectations. The court examines the statutory scheme governing the contracts and the powers of the government.

The court order discusses the Act and Rules related to the development and regulation of mines and minerals under the control of the Union. These regulations provide a regulatory regime to govern the grant of concessions in respect of mines and minerals, which are the property of the State. The Act and Rules include provisions for the termination of prospecting licenses or mining leases, the power of State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals, and the grant of contracts by auction. The court order also highlights the importance of following these regulations, as any permit or lease granted in contravention of the Act or Rules shall be void and of no effect.

The court order outlines the procedures for auctioning mining contracts, including the requirement to post notices in various locations and provide detailed information about the auction. The order also includes rules for surrendering a mining contract and general restrictions for granting mineral concessions. The court notes that the state government has the power to regulate mining and mineral prospecting, including the terms and conditions for granting contracts and the procedure for obtaining them. The court also examines the argument that a Cabinet decision does not apply to the petitioners' contracts.

The court order discusses a decision made by the Cabinet of Punjab regarding contracts for excavation of minor minerals through progressive bidding/reverse bidding method. The proposal approved involves conducting auctions through progressive bidding procedure, increasing royalty rates gradually, and changing existing contracts under reverse bidding. The order includes a comparative chart of expected revenue under both procedures and mentions the potential for the government to receive a contract amount of Rs.459 crore through progressive bidding, which is Rs.320 crore more than the existing procedure.

The court order pertains to a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers in the State of Punjab to change the mode of auction for minor minerals. The decision was taken after considering the revenue enhancement that could be achieved through progressive bidding. The court rejected arguments by petitioners that the decision did not refer to their mines and that the impugned notices were beyond the Cabinet decision. The court also held that the terms of a subsisting contract can be changed by an executive decision if it is sanctioned by the Act, Rules, terms of the E-auction and conditions mentioned in Form-L. The court cited the Pallava Granite Industries case to support its ruling.

The court order discusses a policy decision made by the State regarding the exploitation of minor minerals. The court rejects the argument that the policy decision is not in the public interest and finds that the decision is legal and permissible in law. The court also rejects the argument that the decision violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court gives existing contractors the option to either carry on prospecting under the changed conditions or to surrender the contract. The court finds that the petitioners are a class apart from new entrants.

The court order states that the State provided a workable option and there was no malafide involved in exercising statutory powers. The petitioners cannot claim equal protection under Article 14 of the Constitution as they are a class apart from new entrants. The court rejects the argument of violation of legitimate expectation as there was no promise made by the State that the terms of the contract would not be changed during its subsistence. The court also states that the concept of regulate includes the power to vary or even destroy existing and subsisting contracts.

The court order discusses the Regulating (Temporary Powers) Act, 1949 and its application to the supply of essential articles, including electricity. The court held that the State Government has the power to regulate the supply of essential articles and modify contractual terms in respect of their supply or distribution. The court also stated that writ courts rarely interfere with policy decisions unless they suffer from want of authority or are patently arbitrary, capricious, and not informed by reason. The court dismissed the writ petitions and directed the petitioners to exercise their option in terms of the impugned notices within one week.

In summary, the Punjab-Haryana High Court has heard several cases related to mining contracts in the state of Punjab. The court order discusses the Act and Rules related to the development and regulation of mines and minerals under the control of the Union. The court also outlines the procedures for auctioning mining contracts and the rules for surrendering a mining contract. The
