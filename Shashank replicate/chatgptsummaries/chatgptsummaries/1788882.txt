The court order in question pertains to a case where Sapuram Pedda Reddenna Chetty filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 10,000 under a promissory note executed by Hussain Saheb. The suit was dismissed by the trial court, and the first appeal was also dismissed by the appellate court on the ground of non-joinder of legal representatives of a deceased defendant. The plaintiff filed a civil revision petition and a second appeal, which were allowed by the court.

The court held that the trial court was justified in proceeding with the suit even after the death of a defendant who remained ex parte, and the non-joinder of legal representatives of the deceased defendant cannot be allowed to defeat the remedy of appeal to the plaintiff. The matter was remanded to the first appellate court for disposal on merits as per law within eight weeks.
