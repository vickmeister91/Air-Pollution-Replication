The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Vishambhar Singh, who was arrested for the illegal transportation of Chambal sand. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicant on a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent and local sureties of Rs. 50,000 each. However, the court has also imposed several conditions on the applicant, which must be adhered to in order for the bail to remain valid.

The first condition imposed by the court is that the applicant must cooperate fully with the investigation and trial. This means that he must provide any information or evidence that is requested of him, and must attend all court hearings as required. Failure to do so could result in the bail being cancelled.

The second condition is that the applicant must not commit a similar offence while he is out on bail. This is a standard condition that is imposed in most bail orders, and is designed to prevent the applicant from engaging in any further criminal activity while he is awaiting trial.

The third condition is that the applicant must not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial. This means that he must attend all court hearings as scheduled, and must not request any delays or postponements unless there is a genuine reason for doing so. Again, failure to comply with this condition could result in the bail being cancelled.

The final condition imposed by the court is that the applicant must not leave India without prior permission from the trial court or the Investigating Officer. This is another standard condition that is imposed in most bail orders, and is designed to ensure that the applicant remains within the jurisdiction of the court while he is out on bail.

It is important to note that the court has made it clear that the bail order will stand cancelled in the event of a bail jump. This means that if the applicant fails to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the court, or if he fails to attend any court hearings as required, the bail will be cancelled and he will be taken back into custody.

Overall, the court order in question is a standard bail order that imposes several conditions on the applicant in order to ensure that he complies with the requirements of the court and does not engage in any further criminal activity while he is out on bail. It is important for the applicant to fully understand and comply with these conditions in order to avoid any further legal trouble.
