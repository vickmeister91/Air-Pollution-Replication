The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to various legal disputes related to beach resorts and constructions in Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala. The first court order pertains to three writ petitions filed by Nobert Lawrence regarding the demarcation of the high tide line (HTL) from the sea shore on the side of his property. The court heard all three writ petitions together and delivered a final judgment on November 8, 2016. The second court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by various parties regarding the demarcation of the HTL and the demolition of unauthorized constructions in the Azhimala Resorts. The order details the history of the case, including previous judgments and directions for demarcation and demolition. The third court order discusses multiple writ petitions filed by different parties regarding the construction of buildings in a coastal regulation zone. The petitioner had constructed buildings beyond the 200m limit and had violated the conditions of the permit. The court had directed the demarcation of the area within 200m of the high tide line, and the petitioner had filed objections to the demarcation. The fourth court order discusses two writ petitions, one filed by Smt. Prasannakumari and the other by Sri. Sivakumar. The court examined the relief sought in the writ petition and found that the directions in Ext.P3 had been complied with by the 3rd respondent-CESS. The fifth court order discusses a report (Exhibit P4) that was prepared by the 3rd respondent, an agency authorized by the government of India, to demarcate the high tide line (HTL) and the no development zone in the coastal regulation zone (CRZ). The court rejects the petitioner's contentions that the demarcation was without authority or notice, and that there were changes in the HTL due to vagaries of nature. The sixth court order discusses the transfer of cases involving environmental issues to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The court found that all matters that can be adjudicated by the NGT should be transferred to it, including those filed before the establishment of the Tribunals. The order also discusses a specific case involving the demarcation of a no-development zone and the construction of a resort in violation of CRZ regulations. The seventh court order discusses the demarcation of the High Tide Line (HTL) and the conduct of the petitioners in relation to their beach resorts. The court finds that the petitioners did not submit any application for permission from the Government of India and that there is no bonafide in their writ petition. The court dismisses the writ petitions and upholds the orders passed by the Ombudsman and the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions.

In the first court order, Nobert Lawrence alleged that the high tide line from the sea shore on the side of his property was not demarcated as directed in a previous judgment. The court heard all three writ petitions together and delivered a final judgment on November 8, 2016. The court found that the demarcation had been done as per the previous judgment and that the petitioner's contentions were baseless. The court also examined a request to transfer the case to the National Green Tribunal, but found no bonafides in doing so. The court cited Section 14 and Section 29 of the NGT Act, which establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and bar civil courts from entertaining appeals or settling disputes that can be adjudicated by the Tribunal. The court also referenced a caution from the Apex Court that cases filed before the establishment of the NGT involving environmental laws or statutes specified in Schedule I should be dealt with by the NGT.
