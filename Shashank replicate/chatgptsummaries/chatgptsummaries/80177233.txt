The court order pertains to a case involving M/S Al-Hamd Agro Food Products Pvt. Ltd. and the Commissioner of Customs, Noida. The appellant was accused of availing inadmissible export incentives by claiming drawback on the quantities of 17625.465 MT of frozen meat to the extent of Rs.4,94,01,708/-. The court found the appellant guilty and ordered confiscation of the meat, demanded the amount of drawback, and imposed a penalty. The appellant appealed the decision, arguing that drawback is not an incentive and that they fulfilled all the requirements for entitlement to drawback.

In response to the appeal, the court order states that the appellant has fulfilled all the conditions for grant of Drawback under Section 75 of the Act. The court notes that violation of any of the conditions of Section 75 of the Act is necessary for applying Rule 16 of the Drawback Rule for recovery of drawback already paid to the appellant. The court also notes that the allegations made in the SCN do not specify any violation of the conditions for grant of Drawback. The court further states that the allegations made in the SCN are based on presumption and assumption and that the Revenue has not produced any tangible evidence to support their allegations. The court concludes that the charges against the appellant are frivolous and not sustainable.

The court order also addresses the appellant's compliance with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and the Foreign Trade (D&R) Act, 1992. The appellant, a meat processing plant, had complied with all conditions set by APEDA and the Foreign Trade (D&R) Act, 1992, and had exported frozen meat from their APEDA-approved unit. The court found that the appellant had not contravened any provisions of APEDA or the Foreign Trade (D&R) Act, 1992, and that the allegations made against them were not sustainable.

However, the court also found that the appellant had exported more frozen meat than the quantity sanctioned by APEDA, and that they had contravened Section 50, sub-section (2) of the Customs Act with intent to export prohibited goods and to claim inadmissible draw-back claim. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order, but directed the concerned authority to refund the amount of duty drawback deposited by the appellant with interest as per rules.
