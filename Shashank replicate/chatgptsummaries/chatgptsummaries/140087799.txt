The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Boutique Hotels (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the State of Rajasthan and various government officials. The petitioner challenges the revocation/cancellation of an order that set aside land for the establishment of a hotel/tourism unit, as well as various notices and proceedings initiated against them. The petitioner also challenges the closure of a road to their resort/hotel and the reservation of the land-use for agriculture. The court is asked to hold that a lease deed not be set aside without due process of law. The factual background of the case is also provided in the order.

The court order discusses a dispute over land that was set aside for a hotel and later allotted to the petitioner for a period of 99 years. The petitioner was required to establish a hotel within two years, but was granted extensions. The petitioner received a show-cause notice in 2012, allegedly in response to a court order, but submitted a detailed reply and did not receive any further communication until 2018. In 2018, the allotment letter and lease deed were revoked without due process, and the petitioner's licenses and approvals were cancelled. The petitioner challenged these actions as arbitrary and violative of their rights under the Constitution. The petitioner also argued that the doctrine of Estoppel should be invoked against the respondents.

The court order pertains to a case of contempt petition filed in Rajasthan. The petitioner had been allotted land for a resort, but the Forest Department had not granted permission for the same. The court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioner's counsel arguing that the land did not fall within forest land and that existing laws permitted the operation of hotels and resorts in ecological sensitive zones. The state government's counsel argued that the lease deed and allotment letter had been cancelled in compliance with court orders and that the road to the resort fell within forest area. The court was tasked with deciding whether the cancellation of the allotment and lease deed was legal and whether the road to the resort fell within forest area.

The court order discusses the cancellation of a lease-deed and allotment order by the respondents, which the court finds to be arbitrary and lacking due process of law. The court emphasizes the importance of the Rule of Law and states that the cancellation of the lease-deed and allotment order could only be done by a competent court of law after a full-blown trial. The court also notes a concern regarding the use of an access road by the petitioner's resort/hotel, which falls within forest area and requires an NOC from the Forest Department. The court decides that this is a disputed question of fact and should be determined by a competent civil court after a full-blown trial. Until then, the Public Trust Doctrine prohibits the petitioner from using the road for commercial activities.

The court order discusses the public trust doctrine, which requires the government to protect natural resources for the enjoyment of the general public and prohibits their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. The doctrine imposes limits and obligations on government agencies and their administrators on behalf of all people, especially future generations. The order also discusses the Forest (Conservation Act), which requires prior approval from the Central Government before using forest land for non-forest purposes. The State Government must first examine the question of whether the land is a forest before submitting a proposal for forest diversion.

The court order pertains to the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. Rule 4 of the 1981 Rules was reframed, requiring User Agencies to submit proposals to the concerned Nodal Officer before undertaking any non-forest activity on forest land. The State Government must send the proposal to the Central Government within 90 days if it requires prior approval under Section 2. The court also discussed the scope of judicial review in matters relating to forests and environment. The court quashed and set aside the impugned order passed by the Revenue Department and the Collector, Jaipur, revoking/cancelling the order dated 10.08.2001, and the unilateral cancellation of Lease-Deed. The petitioner was directed not to use the approach road to its hotel/resort since part of the same allegedly falls within Forest area. The petitioner was given the liberty to invoke the jurisdiction of a competent court of law to determine whether it has a right to use the road or not and whether or not the road falls within forest area.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Boutique Hotels (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the State of Rajasthan and various government officials. The petitioner challenges the revocation/cancellation of an order that set aside land for the establishment of a hotel/tourism unit, as well as various notices and proceedings initiated against them.
