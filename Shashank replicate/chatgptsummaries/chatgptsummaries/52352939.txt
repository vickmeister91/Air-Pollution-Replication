The court has granted bail to Rafiq Khan and Nazir Khan, who were arrested in connection with an FIR filed by the Regional Forest Officer Unit III, Mohangarh, Dist. Jaisalmer for offences under Section 2(16)(17)(20), 9, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The accused must furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Rafiq Khan and Nazir Khan were arrested for offences under Section 2(16)(17)(20), 9, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Section 2(16) defines "hunting" as capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring, or trapping any wild animal, and Section 2(17) defines "poaching" as hunting in contravention of any law for the time being in force. Section 2(20) defines "trophy" as any part of an animal, other than meat, which is used as a trophy, and Section 9 provides for the protection of wild animals. Section 50 provides for the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary or national park, and Section 51 provides for the punishment for offences committed outside India.

The accused were granted bail on the condition that they furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. The stipulation was that they appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This is a standard condition for bail, and it ensures that the accused do not abscond or evade trial.

The granting of bail to the accused is a significant development in this case. It means that they will be released from custody and will be able to prepare for their trial. However, it is important to note that bail is not a verdict of innocence. The accused will still have to face trial, and the court will have to determine whether they are guilty or not.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Rafiq Khan and Nazir Khan, who were arrested in connection with an FIR filed by the Regional Forest Officer Unit III, Mohangarh, Dist. Jaisalmer for offences under Section 2(16)(17)(20), 9, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The accused must furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This is a significant development in the case, but it is important to remember that bail is not a verdict of innocence, and the accused will still have to face trial.
