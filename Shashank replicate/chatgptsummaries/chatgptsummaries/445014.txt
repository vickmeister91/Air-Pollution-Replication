However, the accused died during the pendency of the revision, and the court had to decide whether to abate the appeal or dispose of it on merit. The court decided to dispose of the case on merit and found that the prosecution had not proved the conscious possession and control of the arms and ammunition recovered from the accused's premises beyond doubt. Therefore, the conviction of the accused was not sustainable, and the revision was allowed.
