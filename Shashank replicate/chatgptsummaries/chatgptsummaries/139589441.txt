The court order in question pertains to a criminal complaint titled Ram Dulari versus Mamta and another, which is currently pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Ambala. The petitioner, who is an accused in the case, challenged an order dated 29.11.2016, which had declined her application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for calling documents.

The trial Magistrate had observed that the accused would have the liberty to lead evidence at the time of their turn, and that the order was well-reasoned. The court dismissed the petition accordingly.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue such summons or order either suo motu or on the application of any party to the proceeding.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought the production of certain documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the trial Magistrate had declined the application, stating that the accused would have the liberty to lead evidence at the time of their turn.

The petitioner had challenged this order before the court, contending that the trial Magistrate had erred in declining the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner had argued that the documents sought were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial, and that the trial Magistrate had failed to appreciate this fact.

However, the court dismissed the petition, holding that the trial Magistrate's order was well-reasoned and did not suffer from any infirmity. The court observed that the accused would have the liberty to lead evidence at the time of their turn, and that this was a sufficient safeguard against any prejudice that may be caused to them.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the trial court's discretion in matters relating to the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. While the section empowers the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, the court has the discretion to decline such requests if it deems fit.

In the present case, the trial Magistrate had exercised this discretion and declined the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court, in turn, had upheld this decision, emphasizing the importance of the trial court's discretion in such matters.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of the trial court's discretion in matters relating to the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. While the section empowers the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, the court has the discretion to decline such requests if it deems fit.
