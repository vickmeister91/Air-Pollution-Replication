The court order in question pertains to a motor vehicle accident case where the Divisional Manager of United India Insurance Company has filed an appeal against the judgment and award passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn) and Additional M.A.C.V., Hubli. The case involves the question of whether the insurance company is liable to pay compensation for the death or bodily injury caused to a person traveling in a goods carriage.

The court has declared that the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation for the death or bodily injury caused to a person traveling in a goods carriage. The direction issued by the Tribunal to pay compensation and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle is contrary to the law. Therefore, the appeal is allowed, and the compensation amount deposited by the insurance company is to be refunded.

The court's decision is based on the interpretation of the law regarding the liability of insurance companies in cases of motor vehicle accidents. The court has held that the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation for the death or bodily injury caused to a person traveling in a goods carriage. This is because the law only requires insurance companies to provide coverage for third-party liability in cases of motor vehicle accidents.

The court has also held that the direction issued by the Tribunal to pay compensation and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle is contrary to the law. This is because the law does not provide for such a direction. The court has therefore allowed the appeal filed by the Divisional Manager of United India Insurance Company and directed that the compensation amount deposited by the insurance company be refunded.

The court's decision in this case has important implications for insurance companies and owners of goods carriages. Insurance companies can take comfort in the fact that they are not liable to pay compensation for the death or bodily injury caused to a person traveling in a goods carriage. Owners of goods carriages, on the other hand, may need to consider obtaining additional insurance coverage to protect themselves against liability in cases of motor vehicle accidents.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of understanding the law regarding liability in cases of motor vehicle accidents. It is also a reminder of the need for insurance companies and owners of goods carriages to ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage to protect themselves against liability in such cases.
