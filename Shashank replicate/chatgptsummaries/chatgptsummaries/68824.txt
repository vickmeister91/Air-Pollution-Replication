The court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner claimed to have been appointed as a C.T. Grade teacher in a recognized Intermediate College in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1980. However, upon investigation, it was discovered that the petitioner was untrained at the time of appointment and did not follow the prescribed procedure for appointment under the Intermediate Education Act. As a result, the court held that the appointment was null and void, and the petitioner had no claim for payment of salary from the State exchequer. The writ petition was subsequently dismissed.

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and requirements when it comes to appointments in the education sector. The Intermediate Education Act lays out specific guidelines for the appointment of teachers, and failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in the appointment being deemed invalid. In this case, the petitioner's lack of training and failure to follow the prescribed procedure ultimately led to the nullification of their appointment.

The court's decision also has significant implications for the petitioner's claim for payment of salary from the State exchequer. As the appointment was deemed null and void, the petitioner has no legal basis for claiming payment from the State. This underscores the importance of ensuring that appointments are made in accordance with the law and that all necessary requirements are met.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and guidelines when it comes to appointments in the education sector. Failure to do so can have serious consequences, including the nullification of appointments and the loss of any claims for payment from the State. It is therefore essential that all parties involved in the appointment process are aware of the relevant laws and regulations and take the necessary steps to ensure compliance.
