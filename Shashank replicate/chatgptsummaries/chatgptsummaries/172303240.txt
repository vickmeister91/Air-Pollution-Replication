The National Green Tribunal issued a court order on February 6, 2014, regarding the negative impacts of tourism on the ecology and environment of Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the Rohtang Pass area. The court noted that unregulated and heavy tourism, overcrowding, misuse of natural resources, construction of buildings and infrastructure, littering of waste, and other activities associated with tourism have caused diverse and devastating impacts on the fragile and sensitive Himalayan ecosystem. The court emphasized the need to identify, measure, and evaluate the negative impacts of tourism and manage them effectively. The court also referred to a report by an Expert Committee constituted by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh.

The court order discusses the negative impact of tourism and vehicular traffic on the environment and ecology of the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh. The report highlights the increase in pollution levels, decrease in snowfall, and receding glaciers due to unregulated tourism and over-construction. The court also notes the impact of vehicular traffic on wildlife and the degradation of forests in the region. The order emphasizes the need for sustainable tourism and measures to reduce pollution and protect the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas.

The court order discusses the fundamental right of citizens to a clean and decent environment, as mandated by the Constitution of India. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife, and the potential harm to human health resulting from development. The court also recognizes the right to a wholesome environment as a fundamental right, and the obligation of the state and citizens to protect and improve it. The court discusses the balance between development and environmental protection, and the need to strike a balance. The court also discusses the significance of environmental protection and the dimensions of the right to a clean and decent environment, as well as the obligation of the state to ensure its fulfillment.

The court order discusses the violation of the rights of yatris to a holy shrine and the lack of basic amenities and healthcare. The court examines the dimensions of the rights protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which includes socio-economic justice, protection of the environment, and security to citizens. The State has a duty to protect the environment and forests while undertaking necessary development with due regard to fundamental rights and values. The court emphasizes the appropriate balance between different activities of the State as the foundation of socio-economic security and proper enjoyment of the right to life. The court concludes that the State and the Shrine Board must act in tandem to ensure protection of rights and discharge of obligations. The fundamental right to a clean environment is also discussed, and the court emphasizes the State's duty to maintain ecological balance and hygienic environment.

The court order states that necessities such as air, water, and soil cannot be polluted or misused to reduce the quality of life for others. The risk of harm to the environment or human health must be decided in the public interest, and life, public health, and ecology have priority over unemployment and loss of revenue. Development and protection of the environment are not enemies, but two sides of the same coin. The right to a healthy and clean environment, including air, water, soil, and noise-free environment, is of paramount consideration. The court has exercised the power of imposing exemplary damages against pollutants to protect the environment and restore the damage done to it. The authors of Environmental Law and Policy in India have observed that Indian environmental statutes chiefly employ a system of licensing and criminal sanctions to preserve natural resources and regulate their use. The court also discusses the degradation of the environment due to lack of effective enforcement of laws and non-compliance with statutory norms. The court suggests various measures to prevent further damage to the environment, including restricting and regulating vehicular traffic, implementing more stringent norms, and using CNG or electrical vehicles for tourism purposes.

The court order pertains to curbing vehicular pollution in the eco-sensitive area of Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh, India. The order directs authorities to implement measures such as regular pollution checks, prohibiting overloading of vehicles, phasing out vehicles more than 10 years old, and introducing BS-IV norms. Only CNG or electric operated buses are permitted to ply from Vashishta to Rohtang Pass for tourism purposes. The order also restricts the use of snow scooters and directs the government to explore the possibility of providing a ropeway from Vashishta to Rohtang Pass. Permits will be issued for public transport, army vehicles, and government vehicles to cross Rohtang Pass, but they will not be allowed to station at Rohtang Pass glacier.

The court order pertains to the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh and emphasizes the need for cleanliness, public amenities, and environmental conservation. The use of plastic bags and littering is strictly prohibited, and eco-friendly toilets and waste management systems must be implemented. The court also directs the government to take measures for reforestation in the area and control traffic density in forest areas. Deforestation is identified as a major cause of environmental degradation, affecting local and regional climates. The court orders immediate and effective measures for reforestation and the identification of areas for plantation.

The court order directs the state government to identify areas for reforestation using remote sensing data and ground verification by the Forest Department. It recommends specific species of trees to be planted at different elevations and emphasizes the need for soil and moisture conservation works, bio-engineering measures, and fire prevention. The
