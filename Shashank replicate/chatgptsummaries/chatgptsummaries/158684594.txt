In the case of Criminal Case No. 137/2008, the petitioner is seeking to quash proceedings against them for offenses under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The petitioner argues that the magistrate cannot take cognizance of the offense under Section 55 of the Act because the complainant, a Sub-Inspector of Police, is not authorized to file a complaint under the Act. The court agrees with the petitioner and notes that the magistrate cannot take cognizance of any offenses except on a complaint filed by authorized persons.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas.

In this case, the petitioner was charged with offenses under the Act, and the case was being heard by a magistrate. However, the petitioner argued that the magistrate could not take cognizance of the offense because the complainant, a Sub-Inspector of Police, was not authorized to file a complaint under the Act.

The court agreed with the petitioner and noted that the magistrate could not take cognizance of any offenses except on a complaint filed by authorized persons. The court cited Section 55 of the Act, which states that any person who has reason to believe that an offense under the Act has been committed may file a complaint with a magistrate. However, the court noted that this provision only applies to authorized persons.

The court then went on to define who is an authorized person under the Act. The court noted that Section 2(c) of the Act defines an authorized person as a person who is authorized by the state government to exercise powers and perform functions under the Act. The court also noted that Section 50 of the Act provides for the appointment of wildlife wardens, who are authorized to exercise powers and perform functions under the Act.

The court then examined the complaint filed by the Sub-Inspector of Police and noted that there was no indication that the Sub-Inspector was authorized by the state government or appointed as a wildlife warden. Therefore, the court concluded that the Sub-Inspector was not an authorized person under the Act and could not file a complaint under Section 55 of the Act.

The court also noted that the complainant had not filed the complaint under any other provision of the Act that would allow them to file a complaint. Therefore, the court concluded that the magistrate could not take cognizance of the offense and quashed the proceedings against the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court in this case held that the magistrate cannot take cognizance of any offenses under the Wild Life (Protection) Act except on a complaint filed by authorized persons. The court defined who is an authorized person under the Act and noted that the complainant, a Sub-Inspector of Police, was not an authorized person. Therefore, the court quashed the proceedings against the petitioner.
