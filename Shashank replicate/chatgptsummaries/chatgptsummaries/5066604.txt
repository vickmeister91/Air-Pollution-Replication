The Patna High Court has recently issued an oral order in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) regarding the drainage problems and the removal of bio and medical waste in the city of Darbhanga. The court found that there is no coordination between the departments responsible for addressing these issues, and directed the Chief Secretary of the State of Bihar to constitute a committee consisting of all three departments to monitor the execution of the work and submit a report to the court. The matter will be listed again after two weeks to enable the Chief Secretary to constitute the committee and submit an affidavit.

The PIL was filed by a local resident of Darbhanga, who highlighted the issue of improper drainage and the accumulation of bio and medical waste in the city. The petitioner argued that the lack of proper drainage and waste management systems in the city is not only causing inconvenience to the residents but also posing a serious threat to public health.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the petitioner and the respondents, observed that there is a lack of coordination between the departments responsible for addressing these issues. The court noted that the Municipal Corporation is responsible for the maintenance of drainage systems, the Health Department is responsible for the disposal of bio and medical waste, and the Public Works Department is responsible for the construction and maintenance of roads. However, there is no coordination between these departments, which is resulting in the improper execution of work and the accumulation of waste in the city.

The court directed the Chief Secretary of the State of Bihar to constitute a committee consisting of all three departments to monitor the execution of the work and submit a report to the court. The court also directed the committee to ensure that the drainage systems are properly maintained, the bio and medical waste is disposed of in a proper manner, and the roads are constructed and maintained properly.

The court further directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that the committee submits a report to the court within two weeks. The court also directed the Chief Secretary to submit an affidavit stating that the committee has been constituted and is monitoring the execution of the work.

The court's order is a significant step towards addressing the issues of drainage and waste management in the city of Darbhanga. The court's direction to constitute a committee consisting of all three departments is a welcome move, as it will ensure that there is proper coordination between the departments and the work is executed in a proper manner.

The court's order is also significant as it highlights the importance of proper waste management and the need for coordination between different departments to address such issues. The court's order is likely to have a positive impact on the residents of Darbhanga, as it will ensure that the issues of drainage and waste management are addressed in a timely and effective manner.
