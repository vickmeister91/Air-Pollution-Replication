In a recent court order, the applicants in a criminal case were charged with violating various sections of the Bombay Prohibition Act. The applicants had previously filed for regular bail, which could not be heard, and have now filed for temporary bail due to an upcoming family event. The court has allowed temporary bail for one of the applicants, Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria, for a period of 10 days on the condition that he surrenders to the jail authority after the period is over and does not abuse the liberty granted to him. However, the application was rejected for the other three applicants.

The Bombay Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Violating this law can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines. In this case, the applicants were charged with violating various sections of the Act, which led to their arrest and detention.

The applicants had previously filed for regular bail, which was not heard due to various reasons. They then filed for temporary bail, citing an upcoming family event as the reason for their request. The court considered their request and granted temporary bail to one of the applicants, Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria, for a period of 10 days.

However, the court rejected the application for the other three applicants. The reasons for the rejection were not specified in the court order. It is possible that the court found their reasons for seeking temporary bail to be insufficient or that they posed a flight risk or a threat to society.

The court order also specified that Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria must surrender to the jail authority after the 10-day period is over and must not abuse the liberty granted to him. This condition is common in cases where temporary bail is granted, as it ensures that the applicant does not flee or commit any further crimes while out on bail.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertains to a criminal case in which the applicants were charged with violating various sections of the Bombay Prohibition Act. The court granted temporary bail to one of the applicants, Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria, for a period of 10 days on the condition that he surrenders to the jail authority after the period is over and does not abuse the liberty granted to him. The application was rejected for the other three applicants, and the reasons for the rejection were not specified in the court order.
