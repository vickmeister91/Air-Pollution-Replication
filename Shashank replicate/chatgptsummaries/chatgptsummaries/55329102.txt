The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in response to two petitions filed by Manimalar Food Product Private Limited against the Panchayat Union Commissioner and the President/Executive Authority of Vettuvapalayam Village Panchayat. The petitioner sought to challenge the notice and memorandum of proceedings issued by the second respondent, requiring the petitioner to obtain permission under section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994, and to cease operations until then. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was impleaded as the 4th respondent in WP.No.15076 of 2010 and 3rd respondent in WP.No.16491 of 2010.

The court directed the petitioner to comply with Board Proceedings dated 20.01.2014 to run the unit after obtaining exquisite permission. The larger issue will be monitored by the National Green Tribunal. This order has significant implications for the petitioner and the larger issue of environmental protection in Tamil Nadu.

The court order pertains to the operation of a food processing unit owned by Manimalar Food Product Private Limited. The unit was located in Vettuvapalayam Village Panchayat and had been operating without obtaining permission under section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994. The Panchayat Union Commissioner and the President/Executive Authority of Vettuvapalayam Village Panchayat had issued a notice and memorandum of proceedings requiring the petitioner to obtain permission and to cease operations until then.

The petitioner challenged this notice and memorandum of proceedings in two petitions filed before the Madras High Court. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was also impleaded as a respondent in both petitions. The petitioner argued that the notice and memorandum of proceedings were illegal and arbitrary and that the petitioner had been operating the unit for several years without any adverse impact on the environment.

The court considered the submissions made by the petitioner and the respondents and observed that the petitioner had been operating the unit without obtaining permission under section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994. The court noted that the petitioner had also not obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.

The court further observed that the operation of the unit without obtaining permission and NOC was in violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the petitioner had also not complied with the directions issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in its proceedings dated 20.01.2014.

The court directed the petitioner to comply with the directions issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in its proceedings dated 20.01.2014. The court further directed the petitioner to obtain permission under section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994, and a NOC from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board before resuming operations.

The court also observed that the larger issue of environmental protection was a matter of public interest and directed that the matter be monitored by the National Green Tribunal. This direction has significant implications for the larger issue of environmental protection in Tamil Nadu.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Madras High Court in response to the petitions filed by Manimalar Food Product Private Limited has significant implications for the petitioner and the larger issue of environmental protection in Tamil Nadu. The court has directed the petitioner to comply with the directions issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and to obtain permission under section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994, and a NOC from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board before resuming operations.
