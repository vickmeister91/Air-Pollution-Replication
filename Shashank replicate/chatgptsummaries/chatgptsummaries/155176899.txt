The court order in question pertains to a case where a petitioner was constructing a sewage and water treatment plant without obtaining the necessary permissions from the appropriate authorities. The Sub Divisional Magistrate had issued orders directing the petitioner to remove the sewage tank and restraining the petitioner from continuing with the construction of the plant.
