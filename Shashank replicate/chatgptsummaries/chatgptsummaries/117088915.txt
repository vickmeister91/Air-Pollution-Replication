The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference.

Kishan was arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act, but the court has granted him bail. Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody until their trial. The court has allowed Kishan to be released on bail without expressing any view on the merits of the case. This means that the court has not made any decision on whether Kishan is guilty or not guilty of the charges against him.

The court has directed Kishan to furnish a personal bond of Rs.25,000/- each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence during trial.

The court has required Kishan to provide a personal bond and a surety to ensure that he will appear in court when required.

The court's decision to grant bail to Kishan is significant because it allows him to be released from custody until his trial. This means that Kishan can return to his normal life while he awaits trial. However, Kishan must still appear in court when required and comply with any other conditions set by the court.
