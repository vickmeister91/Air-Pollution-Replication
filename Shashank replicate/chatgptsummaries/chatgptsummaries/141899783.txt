The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Special Judge Atrocities in a case. The petitioner had requested the trial court to call certain records and witnesses, which were rejected by the court. The petitioner argued that the trial court's rejection of their request was illegal and improper.

The court, however, found no infirmity, illegality, or impropriety in the trial court's order. The court dismissed the petitioner's petition, stating that the trial court's decision was well within its rights. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the trial court's decision was illegal or improper.

The court's decision was sent to the trial court for information and necessary compliance. This means that the trial court will be informed of the higher court's decision and will be required to comply with it. The trial court will likely be required to continue with the case as it was proceeding before the petitioner filed their petition.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in a petition. Without evidence, it is unlikely that a court will find in favor of the petitioner. Additionally, the decision emphasizes the importance of following proper legal procedures and respecting the decisions of lower courts.
