The Madras High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by P.S. Neelakantan against Madras Fertilizers Ltd. The petitioner was the Executive Director (Technical) of the company, and the charge memo was issued against him alleging that there had been instances of "shut down" of the factory. The petitioner submitted his comments and stated that the shut downs were not due to any human error. The respondents filed a counter affidavit stating that the petitioner failed to discharge his duties and that disciplinary actions were initiated against him. 

The court considered the charges framed against the petitioner and whether they were maintainable. The controversy in issue was whether the charges for the shut downs on 29.12.2004, 5.1.2005, and 10.1.2005 could be proceeded further or not. The court found that except for one person, no allegation against any other person or officer was made, including against the petitioner. The court ordered that the charges against the petitioner were not maintainable.

In another court order, the charge memo issued against an Executive Director of a company for alleged lack of supervision leading to two shutdowns in the plant was quashed. The court found that the charge memo was issued belatedly and without any material evidence against the Executive Director. The court also noted an element of bias against the Executive Director due to a vigilance report submitted by him. The court allowed the writ petition and directed the company to settle the terminal benefits due to the Executive Director.

The two court orders are related to charges against an Executive Director of Madras Fertilizers Ltd. The first order dealt with charges related to shut downs in the factory, while the second order dealt with charges related to lack of supervision leading to shutdowns. In both cases, the court found that the charges were not maintainable and quashed the charge memo.

In the first order, the court found that no allegation against any other person or officer was made, including against the petitioner. This suggests that the petitioner was being singled out for disciplinary action, which may have been unfair. The court's decision to quash the charges against the petitioner was therefore justified.

In the second order, the court found that the charge memo was issued belatedly and without any material evidence against the Executive Director. The court also noted an element of bias against the Executive Director due to a vigilance report submitted by him. This suggests that the charge memo may have been motivated by personal animosity rather than a genuine concern for the company's operations. The court's decision to quash the charge memo and direct the company to settle the terminal benefits due to the Executive Director was therefore justified.

Overall, the two court orders suggest that the charges against the Executive Director were not well-founded and may have been motivated by personal animosity. The court's decision to quash the charges and direct the company to settle the terminal benefits due to the Executive Director was therefore a just outcome.
