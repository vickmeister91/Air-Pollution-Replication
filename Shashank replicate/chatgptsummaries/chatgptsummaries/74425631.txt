The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a resident of Narayan Sarovar, Ta:Lakhpat, Dist: Kutchh, seeking various reliefs, including restraining the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat from reclaiming the land of Narayan Sarovar - Tirthdham and its Catchment Area for constructing Car Parking, Garden Area, Latrines Area, and platforms. The petitioner alleged that the construction had resulted in filling up the Sarovar with sand, stones, cement, and other materials, resulting in water pollution. The District Collector filed an affidavit-in-reply, stating that the allegations of filling up the Sarovar were far from the truth and that all possible precautions had been taken to ensure that the Narayan Sarovar was not damaged in any manner.

The court examined the evidence, including maps and photographs, and found that the allegations were baseless and that the construction was not encroaching on the pond. The court also noted that the State had a duty to protect and improve water bodies, and that citizens had a duty to protect the environment. The petitioner's request to remove the construction was denied.

The court order also discussed a petition regarding the construction of a building near a lake in Narayan Sarovar. The petitioner argued that the construction should be removed to protect the environment, including the water bodies, as per Article-21 and Article-51A(g) of the Constitution. The government pleader argued that the construction was not obstructing the flow of water and that the project had commenced in 1999. The court referred to a previous case and emphasized the duty of the State Government and citizens to protect and improve water bodies. The court directed the State Government to notify all water bodies in the territory of the State and protect, maintain, and preserve them. The court also emphasized the importance of maintaining the quality of water and managing water resources efficiently.

The court order directed the authorities to take steps to preserve and improve the quality of water in lakes and ponds, which are important resources for recreational activities and habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species. The management of water quantity cannot be done without considering water quality, and water supply schemes generating large amounts of waste water should be designed with matching drainage networks and wastewater treatment facilities. The State Government was directed to notify all lakes and ponds in the official gazette within three months and protect them from alienation or transfer. The authorities should also monitor the rejuvenation, maintenance, and preservation of waterbodies and remove existing encroachments. The court also directed the concerned authorities to determine the peripheral areas surrounding a lake or pond on which construction may be prohibited and notify the same.

The court order also directed authorities and local bodies to rejuvenate waterbodies by desilting and recharging them, and taking measures against pollution. The state government was to constitute a Water Resources Council and Committee to oversee the protection and preservation of waterbodies. Encroachments were to be removed, and a record of them maintained. The court also addressed the filling-up of Narayan Sarovar and directed authorities to protect the existing boundary and ensure no further reclamation or filling-up occurs. The Sarovar was not to be polluted in any manner. The PIL was closed with no order as to costs.

In summary, the court order dealt with a PIL filed by a resident of Narayan Sarovar seeking various reliefs, including restraining the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat from reclaiming the land of Narayan Sarovar - Tirthdham and its Catchment Area for constructing Car Parking, Garden Area, Latrines Area, and platforms.
