The High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur has granted bail to Gemra Ram, who was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each and appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Gemra Ram was arrested for violating this law, and the court has now granted him bail.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody until their trial. The court grants bail based on certain conditions, such as the payment of a bond or surety, to ensure that the person appears in court on every date of hearing.

In this case, the court has directed Gemra Ram to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. This means that he has to pay Rs.50,000/- as a guarantee that he will appear in court on every date of hearing. Additionally, he has to provide two sureties, who will also guarantee his appearance in court.

The court has also directed Gemra Ram to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. This is a standard condition for bail, as it ensures that the person does not abscond or evade the trial.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Gemra Ram is significant, as it allows him to be released from custody and prepare for his trial. However, he still has to comply with the conditions set by the court, such as appearing in court on every date of hearing and paying the bond and sureties.
