The court has issued an order that requires a monitoring agency consisting of experts from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Institute of Technology (SVPNIT) to monitor all industrial units within Sarigam Industrial Estate, Valsad. The order mandates that all units must obtain certification from SVPNIT, including those not discharging any effluent. Running industrial units with effluent treatment plants must obtain certification to show they are treating their effluents in conformity with the law. 

The court order also allows units that have been ordered to close to start trial production and discharge treated effluents, but they must obtain permission from the court based on SVPNIT's report within 15 days. This provision is aimed at ensuring that the units that have been ordered to close do not continue to operate without proper treatment of their effluents. 

The order also prescribes fees for inspection and directs the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation to repair and install a new pipeline to carry treated effluents to the sea. This is a significant step towards ensuring that the effluents are treated properly and do not harm the environment. 

The court order is a response to the growing concern over the pollution caused by the industrial units in the Sarigam Industrial Estate. The pollution has been affecting the health of the people living in the area and has also been damaging the environment. The court order is aimed at addressing these concerns and ensuring that the industrial units operate in a manner that is environmentally sustainable. 

The monitoring agency consisting of experts from SVPNIT will play a crucial role in ensuring that the industrial units comply with the court order. The agency will monitor the effluent treatment plants and ensure that they are functioning properly. It will also inspect the industrial units to ensure that they are not discharging any effluent without proper treatment. 

The requirement for all units to obtain certification from SVPNIT is a significant step towards ensuring that the industrial units operate in a manner that is environmentally sustainable. The certification process will ensure that the effluent treatment plants are functioning properly and that the effluents are being treated in conformity with the law. 

The provision allowing units that have been ordered to close to start trial production and discharge treated effluents is a pragmatic approach to the problem. It recognizes that the closure of the units may have a significant impact on the local economy and allows the units to continue operating under certain conditions. However, the requirement to obtain permission from the court based on SVPNIT's report within 15 days ensures that the units do not continue to operate without proper treatment of their effluents. 

The court order also prescribes fees for inspection. This is a significant step towards ensuring that the monitoring agency has the resources it needs to carry out its duties effectively. The fees will also act as a deterrent to industrial units that may be tempted to flout the law. 

The directive to the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation to repair and install a new pipeline to carry treated effluents to the sea is a crucial step towards ensuring that the effluents are disposed of properly. The pipeline will ensure that the effluents do not contaminate the local water sources and harm the environment. 

In conclusion, the court order is a significant step towards ensuring that the industrial units in the Sarigam Industrial Estate operate in a manner that is environmentally sustainable. The order mandates the monitoring of all industrial units by a team of experts from SVPNIT and requires all units to obtain certification from SVPNIT. The order also allows units that have been ordered to close to start trial production and discharge treated effluents, but they must obtain permission from the court based on SVPNIT's report within 15 days. The order prescribes fees for inspection and directs the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation to repair and install a new pipeline to carry treated effluents to the sea. These provisions are aimed at ensuring that the effluents are treated properly and do not harm the environment.
