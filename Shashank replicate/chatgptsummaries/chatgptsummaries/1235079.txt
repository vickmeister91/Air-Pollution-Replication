The court orders discussed in this article pertain to criminal revision applications in the State of Gujarat. The first order deals with a prosecution witness who did not support the prosecution case during his examination-in-chief. The Public Prosecutor requested the trial court to declare him hostile, but the respondent moved an application supported by documentary evidence, objecting to his being declared hostile. The trial court considered the application on merits and allowed it, leading to the present application. The State of Gujarat filed the present revision application, challenging the trial court's order.

The court examined the evidence and documents produced by the respondent and concluded that he had a right to put forth his case before the court and was not trying to protect the accused. The court held that a witness should be regarded as adverse and liable to be cross-examined by the party calling him only when the court is satisfied that the witness bears hostile animus against the party for whom he is deposing or that he does not appear to be willing to tell the truth. The court also discussed the exercise of powers under section 154 of the Evidence Act and the discretion of the court to permit cross-examination.

The second court order discusses the issue of declaring a witness hostile in a criminal trial. The prosecution requested the court to declare the witness hostile as he did not support their case during examination-in-chief. However, the witness produced a typed application objecting to being declared hostile. The court considered the evidence produced on record, including affidavits made by police officers, and recorded findings on the veracity of the witness's say as well as the prosecution case.

The court held that a witness should be regarded as adverse and liable to be cross-examined by the party calling him only when the court is satisfied that the witness bears hostile animus against the party for whom he is deposing or that he does not appear to be willing to tell the truth. The court also discussed the exercise of powers under section 154 of the Evidence Act and the discretion of the court to permit cross-examination.

The third court order discusses the principles and parameters for declaring a witness hostile in a criminal trial. The court may look into the witness's previous statements to determine if there is any inconsistency with their current testimony. The court must exercise its discretion judiciously and not allow the witness to be heard on the question of being declared hostile. The court may permit cross-examination of the witness by the party calling them if it is expedient to extract the truth and do justice. The court may also consider the witness's demeanor, attitude, and previous inconsistent statements.

The trial court erred in allowing the witness to lead evidence in support of their objection to being declared hostile and in directing the police to submit a report on the matter. The court may exercise its powers under Section 311 of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act to aid justice, but the trial court's actions in this case did not fall within the ambit of these provisions. The court may exercise its discretion to declare a witness hostile, but in this case, the witness had already resiled from their previous statement, and the trial had been delayed for almost a year, so the court did not remand the matter to the trial court.

The fourth court order discusses the issue of a witness who has given inconsistent statements in a case. The court finds that the witness has resiled from his previous statement and therefore should be declared a hostile witness. The court also discusses the maintainability of the revision application and concludes that it is maintainable in this case. The court quashes the impugned order and allows permission to put questions to the witness under section 154 of the Evidence Act. The court clarifies that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and that the trial court should rely only on evidence brought on record during examination-in-chief and cross-examination of the witness.

In conclusion, these court orders deal with the issue of declaring a witness hostile in a criminal trial. The court must exercise its discretion judiciously and not allow the witness to be heard on the question of being declared hostile. The court may permit cross-examination of the witness by the party calling them if it is expedient to extract the truth and do justice. The court may also consider the witness's demeanor, attitude, and previous inconsistent statements. The trial court must rely only on evidence brought on record during examination-in-chief and cross-examination of the witness.
