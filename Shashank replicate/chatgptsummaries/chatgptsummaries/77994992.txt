The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant, Rajendra Mishra, had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for calling the record of his account of Allahabad Bank, Kamla Nagar Branch, Bhopal for the period 2001-2013. The application was dismissed by the trial court, and the applicant had approached the higher court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The court found that the trial court had not committed any illegality in dismissing the application and dismissed the petition. This decision was based on several factors, including the fact that the applicant had not provided any specific reasons for why he needed the bank records, and that the trial court had already considered and rejected his previous applications for the same records.

The court also noted that the applicant had not provided any evidence to suggest that the bank records were necessary for the proper adjudication of the case, and that the trial court had already considered and rejected his previous applications for the same records. Additionally, the court found that the applicant had not demonstrated that he had exhausted all other available remedies before seeking the bank records.

Overall, the court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the relevant legal provisions. While the applicant may have been disappointed with the outcome, the court's decision was based on a thorough analysis of the evidence and the law, and was therefore a fair and just resolution of the matter.
