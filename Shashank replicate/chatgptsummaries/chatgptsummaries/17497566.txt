The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Meera Bai Bairagi against the Mahila and Bal Vikas Vibhag. Bairagi was dismissed from her post as an Aanganwadi Worker due to complaints against her. However, she claimed that the complaints were a result of her refusal to pay illegal gratification to the Sarpanch. The court found that no enquiry was conducted with the participation of Bairagi, which is a violation of the principles of natural justice. The court cited various cases and definitions of natural justice and ordered for the impugned order to be quashed.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice in judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative processes. The two main rules are "no man shall be a judge in his own cause" and "hear the other side."

The court concludes that natural justice is essential to fair adjudication and is firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.
