In the first court order, the petitioner, Kalu Masar, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking the quashing of an order passed by the State of Rajasthan, which transferred a mining lease to M/s Solanki Green Marble Pvt. Ltd. The petitioner alleged that the transfer was illegal and fraudulent, as he was coerced into signing blank papers, which were later used to form the company. The petitioner also claimed that the transfer was made without adhering to mandatory guidelines issued by the Government of India. The respondents denied the allegations and argued that the transfer was made in accordance with the law. The court heard both parties and reserved its judgment.

In the second court order, the court order pertains to the transfer of mining leases and the imposition of transfer fees. The Forest Advisory Committee recommended that transfer of leases need not be brought before the FAC and the Administrative Ministry may take a decision in this regard. The Central Government approved the levy of 10% Net Present Value or Rs.1,00,000/- as transfer fee to discourage middlemen from processing proposals. The court found that there was no legal impediment for transfer of the mining lease in favour of the respondent No.6 and dismissed the writ petition challenging the transfer of the mining lease.
