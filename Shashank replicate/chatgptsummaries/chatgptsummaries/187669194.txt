The court order pertains to a dispute between the petitioner and the 9th respondent regarding the construction of a multi-storied residential complex close to the petitioner's residential house. The petitioner claims that the large water extraction by the residents of the said building, using a bore-well constructed in the complex, has led to the attenuation of water sources to his property, including his well. The petitioner avers that the construction of a bore-well requires permission from the Grama Panchayat under Rule 91 of the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules and that the 9th respondent, in not having obtained such permission, the bore-well constructed by him should be deemed to be illegal and therefore, shut down.

The court examined Rule 91 of the Rules and found that even a bore-well cannot be dug without the permission of the Secretary of the LSGI and without first obtaining clearance from the Ground Water Department. However, the bore-well was drilled in 2011 when Rule 93A had not been introduced, and therefore, the construction and digging of the tube-well by respondents 8 & 9 in the year 2011 cannot be found to be hit by the amendment. The court order states that the construction and digging of a tube-well by respondents 8 & 9 in 2011 cannot be found to be illegal as the rules regarding tube-wells were introduced in 2014.

However, the court orders a joint inspection by the Environmental Engineer and the District Officer, Ground Water Department to ensure that respondents 8 & 9 comply with the strict conditions prescribed in Ext.P7. The court also directs the 7th respondent to be personally in charge of the water meter installed in the tube-well to ensure that the reading of the same is conducted properly without any manipulation or guile. The writ petition is ordered as above with no order as to costs.

The court order clarifies that the construction and digging of the tube-well by respondents 8 & 9 in 2011 cannot be deemed illegal as the rules regarding tube-wells were introduced in 2014. However, the court orders a joint inspection by the Environmental Engineer and the District Officer, Ground Water Department to ensure that respondents 8 & 9 comply with the strict conditions prescribed in Ext.P7. The court also directs the 7th respondent to be personally in charge of the water meter installed in the tube-well to ensure that the reading of the same is conducted properly without any manipulation or guile.

The court order highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and clearances before undertaking any construction activity, including the digging of bore-wells and tube-wells. The court's decision to order a joint inspection by the Environmental Engineer and the District Officer, Ground Water Department is a welcome move as it ensures that the respondents comply with the strict conditions prescribed in Ext.P7. The court's direction to the 7th respondent to be personally in charge of the water meter installed in the tube-well is also a positive step as it ensures that the reading of the same is conducted properly without any manipulation or guile.

In conclusion, the court order provides clarity on the legality of the construction and digging of tube-wells and bore-wells and emphasizes the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and clearances before undertaking any construction activity. The court's decision to order a joint inspection and direct the 7th respondent to be personally in charge of the water meter installed in the tube-well is a positive step towards ensuring compliance with the prescribed conditions and preventing any manipulation or guile.
