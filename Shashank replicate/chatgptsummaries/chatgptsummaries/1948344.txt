The court order in question pertains to the jurisdiction of the appellate court to hear appeals arising from an order under Section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code. The court begins by noting that determinations made under Section 47 on or after 1-2-1977 are not decrees and therefore not appealable. This is an important point, as it means that parties who are dissatisfied with such determinations cannot simply file an appeal and have their case heard by a higher court.

The court goes on to discuss the amendment made in Section 2(2) of the Code, which has taken away the right of appeal in certain cases. Specifically, the court notes that the amendment has removed the right of appeal in cases where the order in question is not a decree, and where the order does not involve a question of jurisdiction. This means that even if a party is dissatisfied with a determination made under Section 47, they may not be able to appeal the decision.

The court then turns to the impugned appellate judgment, which it ultimately sets aside. The court notes that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, as the order in question was not a decree and did not involve a question of jurisdiction. As a result, the appellate court's decision was null and void.

Finally, the court allows the parties to present their appeals as revisions. This means that the parties will have the opportunity to have their case heard by a higher court, but they will need to do so through the process of revision rather than appeal. This is an important distinction, as it means that the parties will need to meet certain criteria in order to have their case heard.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of the appellate court when it comes to appeals arising from orders under Section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code. It also underscores the fact that the right of appeal has been limited in certain cases, and that parties may need to pursue other avenues in order to have their case heard by a higher court.
