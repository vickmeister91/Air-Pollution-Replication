The court order pertains to a mortgage suit where the appellant and his co-heirs mortgaged their two-third interest in a property as security for a loan. The trial court passed a preliminary decree for the recovery of the mortgage money, and a final decree was passed when the appeal against the preliminary decree was pending in the High Court. The property was sold in execution of the final decree, but the appellant objected to the sale, and the High Court rejected the objection. 

The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeal of the judgment-debtor-appellant. The Supreme Court stated that the auction sale in favor of the auction-purchasers and confirmation of that sale automatically becomes non-est. The appellant was directed to pay interest on the blocked sum of the purchase money to the auction-purchasers.
