The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of petitioners who claimed to be the owners of vehicles seized by forest or police officers on suspicion of forest offenses under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners had applied for interim release of their vehicles under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but their applications were rejected on the ground that no court had jurisdiction to order for such interim release in view of the bar under Section 52C of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953.

The court was asked to answer the question of whether the vehicle seized under the provisions of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 can be released during pendency of the trial on supurdgi to the registered owner by the criminal court where trial is pending or such a power can only be exercised by the competent authority named in the Act as per the amended Sections 52 to 55 of the Act.

The court analyzed the relevant sections of the Act and concluded that the authorized Forest Officer cannot order for confiscation unless he sends an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made. The court order states that if a forest offence has been committed using a vehicle, an authorized Forest Officer may confiscate the vehicle by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded. However, the officer cannot order for such confiscation unless he sends an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence.

Once the vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi. The order also cites previous Supreme Court rulings on similar provisions in other Acts and holds that a vehicle seized under the provisions of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 cannot be released during the pendency of trial on supurdgi to the registered owner by the Magistrate, where the trial is pending, in view of specific bar to jurisdiction of Court under section 52C of the Act.

The court order clarifies that the power to release a seized vehicle during the pendency of trial on supurdgi can only be exercised by the competent authority named in the Act as per the amended Sections 52 to 55 of the Act. The court also emphasized that the provisions of the Act must be strictly followed and that the authorized Forest Officer must send an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of courts in cases of seizure of vehicles under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. It also emphasizes the importance of following the provisions of the Act and ensuring that the authorized Forest Officer sends an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made.

Overall, the court order provides clarity on the legal framework surrounding the seizure of vehicles under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 and emphasizes the importance of following the provisions of the Act in such cases.
