The Bombay High Court recently heard a petition challenging the issue of process against the petitioners in Criminal Case No. 307 of 1988 on the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thane. The petitioners were accused of violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court considered whether the prosecution of the petitioners was sustainable in the absence of specific sanction against them.

The court held that the complaint was filed by an Air Pollution Officer who cannot be delegated the power to pick and choose the directors and officers of the company. The statutory power of giving sanction is given to the Board. The Board has to apply its mind to all the materials placed before it and then sanction prosecution against the company, its officers and directors who are responsible for the day to day affairs of the company.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the criminal proceedings against the petitioners. However, the learned Magistrate can proceed to try accused No. 1, the company, according to law.
