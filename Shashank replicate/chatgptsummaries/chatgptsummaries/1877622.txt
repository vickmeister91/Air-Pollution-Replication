The court order in question is a revision under the U.P. Sales Tax Act against an order of the Tribunal relating to the assessment year 1985-86. The case involves a dealer who established a new unit for manufacturing Dal and held an Eligibility Certificate under Section 4-A of the Act, which exempted Dal manufactured by the dealer from tax. However, the dealer issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to purchasers of Dal, which led to the Assessing Authority initiating proceedings under Section 3-B.

The order passed under Section 3-B was challenged by the dealer in appeals before the Tribunal, which allowed the appeals and set aside the order. However, the court held that the order of the Tribunal was erroneous and set it aside, stating that the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) were false and wrong, and on account of their issuance, tax ceases to be leviable on the purchases.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the dealer had issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to purchasers of Dal, which contained false and wrong declarations. The court held that the issuance of these forms had the effect of exempting the purchases from tax, even though they were not eligible for such exemption. The court also noted that the dealer had not produced any evidence to show that the purchases were eligible for exemption under Section 4-A of the Act.

The court further observed that the dealer had not maintained proper records of the purchases and sales of Dal, which made it difficult to ascertain the eligibility of the purchases for exemption. The court held that the dealer was liable to pay tax on the purchases, as the issuance of Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) did not confer any exemption on the purchases.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of maintaining proper records and complying with the provisions of the U.P. Sales Tax Act. It also emphasizes the need for dealers to ensure that they do not issue false or wrong declarations, as this can have serious consequences. The court's decision serves as a reminder to dealers to be diligent in their compliance with the law and to maintain accurate records of their transactions.
