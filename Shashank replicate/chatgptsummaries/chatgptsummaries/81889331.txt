The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by a tenant against an eviction order passed by the Rent Controller. The landlord had filed a petition for eviction against the tenant for non-payment of rent. The tenant had filed an application under Section 47 of the Civil Code Procedure, contending that he had constructed a superstructure on the premises and hence the eviction petition was not maintainable. The Rent Controller had rejected the application, and the tenant had filed a revision petition. The court dismissed the revision petition, stating that the tenant cannot raise factual aspects that have already been rejected in the main proceedings.

The case at hand involves a dispute between a landlord and a tenant over non-payment of rent and the construction of a superstructure on the premises.
