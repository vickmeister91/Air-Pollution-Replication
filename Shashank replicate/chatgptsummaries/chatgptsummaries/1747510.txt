The Citizens Council of Jamshedpur filed a writ petition in court seeking to quash an order allowing an exhibition to be held on a public playground. The petitioner argued that the playground is used by children and others for recreational purposes and that the exhibition would cause health hazards, traffic, law and order problems, and noise pollution. The respondents, on the other hand, denied these claims and argued that the playground is used for social and cultural activities and that the exhibition had been granted permission after consulting with various institutions.

The court found that interference was not warranted as there was a serious dispute about the facts and nature of pleadings. However, the court emphasized the duty of the concerned authorities to ensure that exhibitions do not create water, air, and environmental pollution and that anti-pollution laws are enforced strictly. The petition was dismissed with no costs.

The case highlights the importance of balancing the interests of different stakeholders in public spaces. While the Citizens Council of Jamshedpur had valid concerns about the potential impact of the exhibition on the playground, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claims. At the same time, the court recognized the need for authorities to take steps to prevent pollution and other negative impacts on the environment and public health.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of following due process in granting permission for public events. The respondents in this case argued that they had consulted with various institutions before granting permission for the exhibition. While the court did not find this argument persuasive in itself, it did suggest that such consultations could be an important factor in determining whether permission should be granted for future events.

Overall, the case highlights the need for careful consideration of the potential impacts of public events on public spaces and the environment. While such events can be important for social and cultural activities, they must be managed in a way that minimizes negative impacts on the community. This requires a collaborative approach that involves all stakeholders, including local authorities, event organizers, and members of the public. By working together, it is possible to create vibrant and inclusive public spaces that benefit everyone.
