The court order in question is related to a case filed by Murlidhar Jha against various government departments and officials in Bihar. The case pertains to the violation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 by brick kilns in the state. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had identified 191 brick kilns to which consent to establish had been given, but only 12 of them had been given environmental clearance.

The court has issued a show cause notice to 97 defaulting units as to why they should not be closed down for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, none of them responded to the notice and have been served with a final closure order. The District Magistrate, Darbhanga, has been directed to enforce compliance by closure and file an affidavit with regard to the steps taken.

The Pollution Control Board has been asked to place on record its affidavit with regard to the remaining brick kilns identified by it. The case has been listed for the next hearing on June 24, 2014.

The court's decision is a significant step towards curbing pollution caused by brick kilns in Bihar. Brick kilns are a major source of air pollution in the state, and their unchecked operation has been a cause of concern for environmentalists and health experts.

The court's decision to issue a show cause notice to defaulting units and subsequently serve them with a final closure order is a strong message to other brick kilns in the state that flouting environmental norms will not be tolerated. The decision also highlights the need for stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations in the state.

The court's directive to the District Magistrate, Darbhanga, to enforce compliance by closure and file an affidavit with regard to the steps taken is a welcome move. It ensures that the closure of defaulting units is not just a paper exercise but is actually implemented on the ground.

The Pollution Control Board's affidavit with regard to the remaining brick kilns identified by it is also crucial. It will provide an insight into the extent of non-compliance by brick kilns in the state and help in devising a strategy to tackle the issue.

The court's decision is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address the issue of air pollution caused by brick kilns in Bihar. The state government needs to take a more proactive role in enforcing environmental laws and regulations and ensure that defaulting units are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court's decision to issue a show cause notice to defaulting units and subsequently serve them with a final closure order is a significant step towards curbing pollution caused by brick kilns in Bihar. The decision highlights the need for stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations in the state and sends a strong message to other brick kilns in the state that flouting environmental norms will not be tolerated. However, more needs to be done to address the issue of air pollution caused by brick kilns in Bihar, and the state government needs to take a more proactive role in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.
