The National Green Tribunal recently heard three applications filed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board against the Municipal Corporation of Bhopal and its officials for violating the Water Act and Environment Act. The Board had given directions to the accused persons to comply with the rules, but they failed to do so. The complaint was filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhopal, and was later transferred to the National Green Tribunal. However, the Tribunal held that it only has jurisdiction over civil cases relating to the environment and cannot deal with criminal cases falling under the purview of the Code. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot adjudicate on the present complaint, and the case must be heard by the Court of competent jurisdiction.

The court order clearly states that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to try cases of criminal nature, and therefore cannot try, adjudicate, or punish accused persons found guilty under Sections 15 and 16 of the Environment Act. The complaint cases are to be returned to the Chief Judicial Magistrate to proceed with the case in accordance with the law. There is no order as to costs.

The National Green Tribunal is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and violations. It was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, and has jurisdiction over civil cases related to environmental issues. The Tribunal has the power to hear cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, and to provide relief and compensation for damages caused by environmental violations.

In the present case, the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had filed three applications against the Municipal Corporation of Bhopal and its officials for violating the Water Act and Environment Act.
