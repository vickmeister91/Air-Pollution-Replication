The Delhi High Court recently heard two petitions filed by Bharti Realty Ltd. and Lodhi Property Co. Ltd. against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) regarding the payment of environmental damages and bank guarantees. The DPCC had directed the petitioners to pay damages and furnish bank guarantees, but the petitioners sought a refund after a previous court ruling held that the DPCC did not have the power to levy such charges. The DPCC argued that the previous ruling was not applicable and that the matter should be re-examined. The court rejected the DPCC's argument and decided to hear all related matters together to avoid multiple litigations.

The court order discusses two petitions challenging the demand for payment and bank guarantee made by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The respondents argue that the petitioners cannot challenge the demand or seek a refund as they had already complied with the demand. The court considers various contentions made by both parties, including the principles of waiver, acquiescence, and estoppel. The court concludes that the matter should be considered by the Division Bench and that the conduct of the petitioners does not necessarily disentitle them from maintaining the petitions.

The court order states that the petitioners were coerced into making payments and furnishing a bank guarantee by the respondent DPCC, who was not entitled to levy such damages. The demands were beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent DPCC and thus non est. The petitioners are entitled to a refund of the amounts paid, but not entitled to any interest. The respondent DPCC is granted liberty to proceed in accordance with the law for any violations committed by the petitioners. The respondent DPCC must refund the amounts collected from the petitioners and release the bank guarantee obtained from them within six weeks. If they fail to do so, they will be liable for interest at 10% per annum.

The court order is a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the DPCC and the petitioners. The DPCC had directed the petitioners to pay damages and furnish bank guarantees for alleged environmental violations. However, a previous court ruling had held that the DPCC did not have the power to levy such charges. The petitioners sought a refund of the amounts paid, but the DPCC argued that the previous ruling was not applicable and that the matter should be re-examined.

The court rejected the DPCC's argument and decided to hear all related matters together to avoid multiple litigations. The court also considered various contentions made by both parties, including the principles of waiver, acquiescence, and estoppel. The court concluded that the matter should be considered by the Division Bench and that the conduct of the petitioners does not necessarily disentitle them from maintaining the petitions.

The court order further states that the petitioners were coerced into making payments and furnishing a bank guarantee by the respondent DPCC, who was not entitled to levy such damages. The demands were beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent DPCC and thus non est. The petitioners are entitled to a refund of the amounts paid, but not entitled to any interest. The respondent DPCC is granted liberty to proceed in accordance with the law for any violations committed by the petitioners. The respondent DPCC must refund the amounts collected from the petitioners and release the bank guarantee obtained from them within six weeks. If they fail to do so, they will be liable for interest at 10% per annum.

The court order is a significant victory for the petitioners, who had been fighting against the DPCC's demands for payment and bank guarantees. The court's decision to reject the DPCC's argument and hear all related matters together will help to avoid multiple litigations and streamline the legal process. The court's ruling that the petitioners were coerced into making payments and furnishing a bank guarantee by the DPCC is also a significant development, as it highlights the need for regulatory bodies to act within their jurisdiction and not overstep their authority.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the petitioners and a reminder to regulatory bodies to act within their jurisdiction and not overstep their authority. The court's decision to hear all related matters together will help to streamline the legal process and avoid multiple litigations.
