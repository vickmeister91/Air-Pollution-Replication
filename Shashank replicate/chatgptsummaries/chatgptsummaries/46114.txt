In a recent court order, the question for decision was whether the power of attorney filed by the plaintiffs was a general power of attorney within the meaning of Rule III of the Rules made by the High Court under Section 122 of the Civil Procedure Code. The court held that the power of attorney was a special power of attorney as it was restricted to the doing of all necessary acts in the accomplishment of one particular purpose, namely, the realization of one particular debt.

The court relied on recognized text-book writers to conclude that the distinction drawn between a general and a special agency leads to the conclusion that the particular document was a special and not a general power. The court dismissed the appeal with costs.

The case at hand involved a dispute over the nature of a power of attorney. The plaintiffs had filed a power of attorney with the court, which they claimed was a general power of attorney. The defendants, however, argued that the power of attorney was a special power of attorney.

The court was tasked with determining whether the power of attorney was a general or special power of attorney. In order to do so, the court relied on recognized text-book writers to understand the distinction between the two types of powers of attorney.

The court ultimately concluded that the power of attorney filed by the plaintiffs was a special power of attorney. The court based its decision on the fact that the power of attorney was restricted to the doing of all necessary acts in the accomplishment of one particular purpose, namely, the realization of one particular debt.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the language used in the power of attorney and the purpose for which it was filed. The court's reliance on recognized text-book writers helped to clarify the distinction between a general and a special power of attorney.

In dismissing the appeal, the court ordered the plaintiffs to pay costs. This decision serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the nature of a power of attorney before filing it with the court. It also highlights the need for careful drafting of legal documents to ensure that they accurately reflect the intentions of the parties involved.
