The court has recently issued two orders pertaining to challenges against notices issued by the H.P. State Pollution Control Board and the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act. In the first case, Hotel Imperial-9 had challenged a notice issued by the pollution control board. The court had earlier directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable, and to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The petitioner filed the affidavit and the court directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In the second case, a petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan and compoundable limits. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish an undertaking to demolish or close the excess construction if the amendment incorporated in the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act is struck down. The petitioner was also ordered to comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. The court noted that several petitions of similar nature were filed and listed together, and passed separate orders in each case. The court observed that the petitioner had benefited from the orders passed by the court and dismissed the writ petition with the petitioner's undertaking to be enforced in accordance with the law. The petitioner was permitted to withdraw the petition subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. All interim orders, if any, were vacated.

In both cases, the court has emphasized the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations. The court has also taken note of the fact that several similar petitions have been filed and listed together, indicating a need for greater attention to be paid to construction and development activities in the state. The court has directed the petitioners to provide detailed information about the extent of construction carried out and to comply with all relevant rules and regulations. In the second case, the court has also ordered the petitioner to provide an undertaking to demolish or close excess construction if necessary.

These court orders highlight the need for greater attention to be paid to construction and development activities in the state. The court has emphasized the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations and has taken a firm stance against those who violate these rules. The court has also recognized the need for greater transparency and accountability in the construction and development sector, and has directed petitioners to provide detailed information about the extent of construction carried out. Overall, these court orders represent an important step towards ensuring that construction and development activities in the state are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.
