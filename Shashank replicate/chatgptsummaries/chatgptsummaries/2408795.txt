The court order in question pertains to a building constructed by M/S.Korath Gulf Links Builders in Calicut. The petitioner had obtained a building permit and a completion certificate, but the certificate was not acted upon due to alleged violations of Coastal Regulation Zone Notifications. The Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority passed an order alleging violations, which was challenged by the petitioner before the National Green Tribunal.

The National Green Tribunal set aside the order of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority and directed the Calicut Corporation to issue appropriate orders regarding the Occupancy Certificate. The petitioner had argued that the allegations of violations were baseless and that the building had been constructed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

The National Green Tribunal agreed with the petitioner and held that the allegations of violations were not supported by any evidence. The Tribunal also noted that the petitioner had obtained all the necessary approvals and certificates before commencing construction and that the building had been constructed in accordance with the approved plans.

The Tribunal further observed that the allegations of violations were made after the completion of the construction and that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations before the order was passed. The Tribunal held that this was a violation of the principles of natural justice and that the order of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority was therefore liable to be set aside.

The Tribunal directed the Calicut Corporation to issue the Occupancy Certificate to the petitioner within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the judgment. The Tribunal also directed the Corporation to ensure that the building was not demolished or sealed on the basis of the allegations of violations.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rights of property owners and developers who have obtained all the necessary approvals and certificates before commencing construction. The order also emphasizes the importance of following the principles of natural justice and giving an opportunity to respond before passing any adverse orders.

The order is likely to have a positive impact on the real estate sector in Kerala as it will provide clarity and certainty to property owners and developers regarding the validity of their approvals and certificates. It will also serve as a deterrent to arbitrary and baseless allegations of violations by regulatory authorities.

In conclusion, the court order in question sets an important precedent for the protection of property rights and the rule of law in the real estate sector. It emphasizes the importance of following due process and the principles of natural justice while regulating construction activities. The order is likely to have a positive impact on the real estate sector in Kerala and will provide much-needed clarity and certainty to property owners and developers.
