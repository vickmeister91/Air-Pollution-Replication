The Jharkhand High Court recently issued an order in response to a writ petition filed by Indian Explosives Pvt. Ltd. The petition sought to quash an order by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) that directed the petitioner to pay interim environmental compensation of Rs.1,00,00,000/- and to submit a Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs.10,00,00,000/- within 30 days.

The court ruled that the writ petition was not maintainable at this stage, as the petitioner had an efficacious/statutory remedy under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, if the petitioner approaches the appellate authority within 15 days and files a memo of appeal along with a limitation petition for condonation of delay, the appellate authority shall consider the limitation petition and take up the appeal on its merit.

The JSPCB shall not take any coercive action against the petitioner until the appellate authority considers the petitioner's application seeking interim relief.

The order by the Jharkhand High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of following the proper legal procedures when dealing with environmental issues. The court has made it clear that there are statutory remedies available to parties who feel aggrieved by the actions of the JSPCB, and that these remedies should be pursued before resorting to writ petitions.

The court's ruling also provides some relief to Indian Explosives Pvt. Ltd., as it prevents the JSPCB from taking any coercive action against the company until the appellate authority considers the petitioner's application seeking interim relief. This gives the company some breathing room to prepare its case and present it to the appellate authority.

Overall, the order by the Jharkhand High Court serves as a reminder that environmental issues are best dealt with through the proper legal channels. While writ petitions can be an effective means of seeking relief, they should only be used as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted. By following the proper legal procedures, parties can ensure that their rights are protected and that environmental issues are addressed in a fair and just manner.
