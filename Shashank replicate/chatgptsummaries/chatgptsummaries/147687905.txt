The Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Istekhar Khan and Md. Rustam in connection with a case registered against them under Sections 379, 411, 420, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and 4/40 BMMCR and 15 of Pollution Act. The prosecution case is that the informant, Abdul Sattar Saif, Mining Officer, raided the Kocharh Balu Ghat and 8 tractors loaded with sand were intercepted without any valid challan and relevant papers. The court has ordered the petitioners to be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad (Bihar) within four weeks from the date of receipt of this order.

The case in question involves two individuals, Istekhar Khan and Md. Rustam, who were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Pollution Act. The prosecution alleges that the two individuals were involved in the illegal transportation of sand, which was intercepted by Abdul Sattar Saif, a Mining Officer. The sand was being transported without any valid challan or relevant papers, which led to the raid and subsequent arrest of the two individuals.

The Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to the two individuals, which means that they will not be arrested unless there is sufficient evidence against them. The court has ordered the petitioners to be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad (Bihar) within four weeks from the date of receipt of this order. This means that the two individuals will have to provide a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each, along with two sureties of the same amount, to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate within four weeks of receiving the court's order.

The decision to grant anticipatory bail to the two individuals was based on the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that they were involved in the illegal transportation of sand. The court also took into account the fact that the two individuals had no prior criminal record and were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail was therefore seen as a fair and just outcome.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of following proper procedures when transporting goods and the consequences of failing to do so. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the two individuals sends a message that illegal activities will not be tolerated and that those who engage in such activities will be held accountable for their actions.
