The court order in question relates to a criminal misc. petition filed by Mr. S.K. Verma, who was challenging an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.2 in Sri Ganganagar. The order in question had been passed in a revision petition filed by the petitioners, who had been seeking to challenge an earlier order passed by the Special Judicial Magistrate (N.I. Act Case) No.2 in Sri Ganganagar.

The petitioners had filed an application under Sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C., which had been rejected by the Special Judicial Magistrate. The petitioners had then filed a revision petition against this order, which had been rejected by the revisional court. Mr. Verma had subsequently filed a criminal misc. petition challenging this order.

The court, however, dismissed Mr. Verma's criminal misc. petition, as well as his stay petition. The reasons for this decision are not provided in the summary.

Overall, it appears that the court was dealing with a complex legal matter involving multiple petitions and appeals. The specific details of the case are not provided in the summary, but it is clear that the court was tasked with resolving a dispute between the petitioners and the judicial authorities in Sri Ganganagar.
