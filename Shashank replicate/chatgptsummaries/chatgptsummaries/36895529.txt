The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the issue of pollution caused by textile processing units in Rajasthan, India. The first court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by the Balotra Water Pollution Control & Research Foundation Trust against the State of Rajasthan and others. The trust was established to construct, operate and maintain a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) in Balotra Municipal Board to prevent pollution caused by textile processing units. The petitioner sought directions to restrain textile industrial units from discharging waste water on land surface and in the river Luni. The court order discusses the history of the issue, including a previous writ petition filed by Mahesh Parekh and directions given by the court in that case.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the State of Rajasthan to restrain textile industrial units from discharging waste water on land surface and in the river Luni, and to close down such units causing contamination to underground water. The petition was transferred to the National Green Tribunal, which directed the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board to constitute an inspection team to verify the capacity of each plant/unit in the industrial cluster, source and consumption level of water, capacity of CETPs, quality of effluent, means and modes of disposal of effluent, and whether the treated effluent is used for plantation. The Tribunal also directed the CETP committee to enforce recommendations and submit an action taken report, and for the State and Central Governments to release funds for installation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants. The Tribunal held that textile industrial units should have authorisation under the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, and directed all industrial units to approach the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board for grant of authorisation. The CETP was directed to have an RO plant of adequate capacity to come to the level of zero liquid discharge. The CETP trust was granted liberty to move an appropriate application before the Tribunal for granting permission to member units to run their operation as and when circumstances permit such industrial activity to be carried out without detriment to the environment.

The third court order pertains to the operation of industrial units in Rajasthan and their impact on the environment. The court noticed that despite an order to stop operations, the units were still working and directed the state to take action against them. The court also directed the CETP Trust to explain why it was supporting the units. The petitioner argued that the court exceeded its jurisdiction and violated the right to carry on trade and business. The Collector of Barmer submitted an affidavit stating that the closure of the units had adversely affected the region's economy and livelihoods. The petitioner argued that unregulated pollution from the units had contaminated the soil and water, causing harm to all living beings in the area. The court also noted conflicting reports on the impact of textile effluent discharge on the environment.

The fourth court order discusses a case where treated wastewater was not meeting discharge standards and a recommendation was made to prohibit discharge into the river. The court granted liberty to the CETP trust to move an appropriate application before the Tribunal for granting permission to member units to run their operation as and when circumstances would permit such industrial activity to be carried out without detriment to the environment. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching a writ court and the circumstances under which a writ court may be approached. The court ultimately finds no merit in the argument that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdictional authority by issuing interim directions without examining the question pertaining to limitation.

The fifth court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy if that is efficacious. In this case, the original applicant's cause is within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and the tribunal possesses ample power to condone the delay. The court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction in this matter and dismisses the writ petition.

Overall, these court orders highlight the ongoing issue of pollution caused by textile processing units in Rajasthan and the efforts being made to address it. The courts and tribunals are taking a multi-faceted approach, including directing inspections, enforcing regulations, and encouraging the use of new technologies like RO plants. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including conflicting reports on the impact of pollution and the economic impact of shutting down industrial units.
