The court order in question pertains to a second appeal filed by Smt. Savitri Devi against the Forest Department, Collector, and Forest Officer of Chhattisgarh. The plaintiff claimed to have purchased a piece of land from Girja Devi, but the state argued that the land was forest land and could not be sold. The trial court and the first appellate court both ruled in favor of the state, and the high court dismissed the second appeal, stating that there was no illegality or perversity in the lower courts' decisions.

The case revolves around a piece of land that was allegedly sold to Smt. Savitri Devi by Girja Devi. The state, however, claimed that the land was forest land and could not be sold. The trial court and the first appellate court both ruled in favor of the state, stating that the land was indeed forest land and could not be sold. Smt. Savitri Devi then filed a second appeal in the high court, which was subsequently dismissed.

The high court's decision to dismiss the second appeal was based on the fact that there was no illegality or perversity in the lower courts' decisions. The court found that the lower courts had correctly interpreted the law and had made their decisions based on the evidence presented before them. The high court also noted that Smt. Savitri Devi had failed to provide any new evidence or arguments that would warrant a reversal of the lower courts' decisions.

The case highlights the importance of proper documentation and due diligence when purchasing land. It is essential to verify the ownership and status of the land before making any transactions. In this case, Smt. Savitri Devi claimed to have purchased the land from Girja Devi, but the state argued that the land was forest land and could not be sold. It is unclear whether Smt. Savitri Devi conducted any due diligence before making the purchase or whether she relied solely on Girja Devi's claims.

The high court's decision to dismiss the second appeal reinforces the importance of following the law and respecting the environment.
