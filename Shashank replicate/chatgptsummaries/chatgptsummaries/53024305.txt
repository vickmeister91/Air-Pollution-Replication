Recently, the NGT heard an appeal filed by Appaso Satappa Tambekar against an order passed by the Appellate Authority Environment under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The appellant argued that the delay in filing the appeal was due to his medical condition, but failed to produce the postal envelope for perusal of the Tribunal. The Tribunal considered the provisions of Order 8, Rule 1 of the C.P.

The limitation for filing an appeal under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, is specifically circumscribed by Section 16 of the enactment.
