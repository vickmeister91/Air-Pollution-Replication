The Calcutta High Court has heard several cases regarding the issue of noise pollution caused by fireworks in West Bengal, India. The court has directed the Pollution Control Board and the police to take measures to stop sound pollution and control it. The Pollution Control Board has set noise level standards for different areas, and the Commissioner of Police has issued an order prohibiting the manufacture, possession, transportation, sale, discharge, and use of certain fireworks generating noise above 65 decibels. The court has heard arguments about the difference between ambient and impulsive noise levels and the permissible exposure levels for noise in factories.

The court notes that while there are regulations for noise levels in factories, there are no specific regulations for fireworks. The court also discusses the difference between ambient and impulsive noise and the impact of fireworks on noise levels during festivals. The court ultimately decides that the State Pollution Control Board has the authority to regulate noise levels and suggests that a decibel limit be set for fireworks. The court also notes that the issue of noise pollution is a dynamic one that requires constant attention and adaptation to changing circumstances.

The court has also discussed the issue of sound pollution caused by fireworks and microphones. The Pollution Control Board had not set a specific decibel limit for fireworks, and the court had previously directed them to do so to protect citizens' fundamental rights. The court expresses displeasure with the Pollution Control Board's failure to take action and directs them to follow the court's orders. Experts have stated that excessive noise above 65 dB(A) can cause hearing impairment, neurological and psychological problems. The court also notes that the city of Calcutta has a high population density and limited open space, making it more susceptible to the negative effects of sound pollution. The court emphasizes the importance of citizens' fundamental rights and the need to regulate businesses that may pose a danger to the community. The court concludes that noise pollution not only creates pollution but also affects behavior and health, and citizens have a right to a decent environment.

The court has also discussed the harmful effects of noise pollution on health, including sleep disturbance, mood changes, and reduced cognitive and cardiovascular performance. The court notes that noise has been identified as a pollutant and sets limits on permissible noise levels in different areas. The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting citizens' right to a peaceful environment and the duty of the court to protect those rights. The court concludes that citizens have a right to sleep and leisure, and that noise pollution can have serious health consequences beyond just hearing loss.

In light of these issues, the court has directed the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to make a decision on the sound level of fireworks in the state of West Bengal, taking into consideration the suggestions and recommendations made by the National Committee on Noise Level Control and after hearing from the applicants and experts. The decision should be made before October 3, 1997, and should be circulated through various media outlets for one month. Until a decision is made, the current state of affairs will continue. The court order also notes the negative effects of noise on health and directs authorities to act on the decisions made by the Pollution Control Board.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court has taken a strong stance on the issue of noise pollution caused by fireworks in West Bengal, India. The court has emphasized the importance of citizens' fundamental rights and the need to regulate businesses that may pose a danger to the community. The court has also recognized the harmful effects of noise pollution on health and has set limits on permissible noise levels in different areas. The court has directed the Pollution Control Board to take action and make a decision on the sound level of fireworks in the state of West Bengal, and has emphasized the need for constant attention and adaptation to changing circumstances in the fight against noise pollution.
