The case of A. Chidambaram involves two Criminal Original Petitions filed to set aside an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in C.C.No.12229 of 2007. The complainant alleged that he had paid Rs.35 lakhs as advance to the accused for purchasing some properties, but when the sale did not go through, the accused agreed to return the amount and gave three post-dated cheques, which were dishonoured. The complainant lodged a complaint for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the jurisdictional Magistrate, which is now under trial in C.C.No.12229 of 2007.

The accused filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to call for the records from the Sub Registrars Office, Saidapet, relating to the issuance of the non-judicial stamp paper on which the Memorandum of Understanding dated 12.10.2005 has been drawn. The trial Court dismissed both the Crl.M.Ps. The High Court found no infirmity in the orders passed by the Court below and dismissed the petitions as devoid of merits.
