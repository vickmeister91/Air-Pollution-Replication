Abdul Vahid, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tijara District Alwar, which refused to release his dumper bearing registration No.HR-74-A-7447. The dumper is case property of case FIR No.210/2018, registered at Police Station Tapukada District Alwar, for offences punishable under Sections 379 and 120-B IPC and under Sections 29, 32, 33, 41 and 42 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The petitioner contended that the dumper was not involved in the commission of the offence and was merely used for transportation purposes. He further argued that the dumper was essential for his livelihood and that its continued detention was causing him financial hardship.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by the petitioner, allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the dumper seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of the like amount. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 as security with the trial court. The court further directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court proceedings.

The court observed that the release of the dumper would not prejudice the investigation or the trial in any manner. The court also noted that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

In another case, the High Court of Delhi dismissed a petition filed by the petitioner, seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner contended that the FIR was registered on the basis of false and frivolous allegations made by the complainant.

The court, after perusing the FIR and the material on record, observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further observed that the veracity of the allegations could only be determined after a proper investigation and trial.

The court also noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy of approaching the trial court for seeking discharge or acquittal. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court proceedings.

In yet another case, the High Court of Bombay allowed a petition filed by the petitioner, seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 406, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner contended that the FIR was registered on the basis of false and frivolous allegations made by the complainant.

The court, after perusing the FIR and the material on record, observed that the allegations made in the FIR were vague and lacked specificity. The court further observed that the allegations did not disclose the commission of any cognizable offence.

The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had produced all relevant documents before the investigating agency. The court, therefore, allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner.

In conclusion, the courts have the power to quash FIRs and release seized property under certain circumstances. The courts consider various factors such as the nature of the offence, the evidence on record, the likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence or absconding, and the impact of the continued detention on the accused's livelihood. The courts also consider the alternative remedies available to the accused, such as approaching the trial court for seeking discharge or acquittal.
