The recent court order pertains to a case between M/s Gobind Forgings Pvt. Ltd and the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The petitioner has alleged that the Board is trying to close their forging unit without passing a formal order, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to challenge the validity of the order. The Board, on the other hand, claims that a formal order has been passed and will be served to the petitioner within two days if not already served.

The court, after hearing both sides, has ordered the Board to serve the formal order within a week and has stayed the sealing of the noise-polluting activities in the unit for three weeks. The petition has been disposed of with no costs.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that all parties have the opportunity to challenge the validity of any order passed against them. The court has rightly recognized the petitioner's right to be informed of the order and to have the opportunity to challenge it.

The court's decision to stay the sealing of the noise-polluting activities in the unit for three weeks is also significant. It shows that the court is mindful of the impact that such actions can have on the petitioner's business and is willing to provide some relief while the matter is being resolved.

Overall, the court's order is a reminder of the importance of following due process and ensuring that all parties have the opportunity to challenge any order passed against them. It also highlights the need for a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of all parties involved.
