The Indian judiciary has been instrumental in upholding the principles of natural justice in various cases. In two recent cases, the courts have ruled on the cancellation of appointments of teachers in Uttar Pradesh due to their lack of the required Basic Teacher's Certificate (BTC). The cases highlight the importance of adhering to the principles of natural justice in administrative decisions.

In the first case, two Urdu teachers were appointed in Uttar Pradesh in accordance with due procedures. However, their appointments were cancelled due to their lack of the required BTC. The teachers argued that their services could not have been cancelled without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The court ruled that the cancellation was lawful as the teachers did not possess the required qualification at the time of their appointment. The court also held that the principle of natural justice did not apply in this case as the minimum qualification was a prerequisite for the appointment. The court directed the state government to re-advertise the post and make fresh recruitment in accordance with the rules.

The second case discusses the principles of natural justice and their application in cases where orders have been passed in violation of these principles. The court cites various cases to explain the circumstances in which the principles of natural justice are attracted and the extent to which they must be complied with. The court ultimately dismisses the appeals in the present case, finding that the appellants did not possess the necessary qualifications for their appointments and therefore no hearing was required before the cancellation of their services.

The first case highlights the importance of possessing the required qualifications for a job. The court held that the minimum qualification was a prerequisite for the appointment and therefore the principle of natural justice did not apply. This ruling is in line with the principle of meritocracy, which is the idea that jobs should be awarded based on merit and qualifications rather than other factors such as nepotism or favoritism.

The second case emphasizes the importance of adhering to the principles of natural justice in administrative decisions. The court cites various cases to explain the circumstances in which the principles of natural justice are attracted and the extent to which they must be complied with. The court ultimately dismisses the appeals in the present case, finding that the appellants did not possess the necessary qualifications for their appointments and therefore no hearing was required before the cancellation of their services. This ruling is in line with the principle of fairness, which is the idea that administrative decisions should be fair and just.

In both cases, the courts have upheld the principles of natural justice and fairness. The courts have emphasized the importance of possessing the required qualifications for a job and adhering to the principles of natural justice in administrative decisions. These rulings are important in ensuring that administrative decisions are fair and just and that jobs are awarded based on merit and qualifications.
