The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that was filed against the State Government's order and notification allowing quarrying leases in forest areas for construction purposes. The petitioners argued that this violated Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in forest areas. The respondents admitted that no quarrying lease could be granted without such approval.

The court, after hearing both sides, clarified that no authority could grant quarrying licenses in forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government. The court declared any licenses granted without compliance with this requirement to be void. The writ petition was allowed.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity in forest areas. The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Committee for Conservation of Forests and Wildlife, which is responsible for advising the Central Government on matters relating to the conservation of forests and wildlife.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and ensures that the Central Government's approval is obtained before any non-forest activity is carried out in forest areas. This is important for the conservation of forests and wildlife, as non-forest activities can have a detrimental impact on the environment.

The court's order also highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary approvals before carrying out any activity in forest areas. This ensures that the impact of such activities on the environment is assessed and mitigated, and that the conservation of forests and wildlife is given due consideration.

The court's order is a reminder to all authorities and individuals that the conservation of forests and wildlife is of paramount importance and that all activities in forest areas must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The order also serves as a warning to those who may seek to carry out non-forest activities in forest areas without obtaining the necessary approvals, that such activities will not be tolerated and that the law will be enforced.

In conclusion, the court's order in the writ petition filed against the State Government's order and notification allowing quarrying leases in forest areas for construction purposes is a significant one. The order upholds the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and ensures that the Central Government's approval is obtained before any non-forest activity is carried out in forest areas. The order also highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary approvals before carrying out any activity in forest areas. The order serves as a reminder to all authorities and individuals that the conservation of forests and wildlife is of paramount importance and that all activities in forest areas must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.
