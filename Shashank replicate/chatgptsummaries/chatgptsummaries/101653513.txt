The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Natubha Viraji Jadeja, challenged the legality and validity of an order passed by the Sessions Judge, Jamnagar. The order in question rejected Jadeja's application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for the production of documents in the custody of the Investigation Officer. These documents were deemed necessary for establishing the innocence of the accused in the alleged offence.

The court rejected Jadeja's application, stating that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come until the stage of defence. The court's reasoning was that the accused would have the opportunity to seek such an order during the defence stage of the trial. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The petitioner argued that the court's decision was incorrect and that the accused should be entitled to seek an order under Section 91 at any stage of the proceedings. The petitioner contended that the accused's right to a fair trial would be compromised if he was not allowed to access the documents in question at an earlier stage.

The court, however, was not persuaded by the petitioner's arguments and dismissed the application. The court held that the accused's right to a fair trial was not compromised by the decision, as he would have the opportunity to seek the documents during the defence stage of the trial. The court also noted that the accused had the liberty to file an appropriate application at the time when he enters the stage of defence.

In conclusion, the court order in question dealt with the interpretation of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and the entitlement of the accused to seek an order for the production of documents at different stages of the proceedings. The court held that the accused's entitlement to seek such an order would ordinarily not come until the stage of defence, and dismissed the petitioner's application. The court, however, reserved the liberty for the accused to file an appropriate application at the time when he enters the stage of defence.
