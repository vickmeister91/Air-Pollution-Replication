The court order pertains to illegal mining activities in the Panchkula district of Haryana, India. The petitioners have alleged that the mining mafia is operating in the area with political patronage and minerals worth crores of rupees are being illegally extracted. The court has directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate to inspect the area and report back. The Department of Mines and Zoology has contended that all minor minerals vest with the State Govt. and that the process of granting mining contracts through public auction does not cause any ecological imbalance. The Forest Department has not disputed the fact that the lower Shivalik hills falling in Panchkula District are mainly drained by barsati nullas and include a considerable area of hill tract.

The court has directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate to submit a report on the number of mining licenses issued, their validity, the extent of mining areas covered, and whether environmental clearance was obtained. The court also discusses a notification issued by the Central Government in 2006, which mandates obtaining prior environmental clearance for new projects or activities. The court is examining whether this notification applies to mining of minor minerals and whether the clearance should be obtained by the Department of Mining or the contractor/lessee. The State of Haryana has defended the notification and the grant of short-term permits during the period of seeking environmental clearance.

The court examines the legal framework and the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2006, which requires prior environmental clearance for any new project or expansion of existing projects. The court considers various issues, including the legal impact of notifications issued under the PLPA 1900, the need to regulate and monitor ongoing mining operations, and whether the mining activities in the Shivalik range fall within the ambit of the 2006 notification. The court also considers whether the prior environmental clearance should be obtained by the State of Haryana or the project proponent/contractor/lessee and the legality of the practice and procedure being followed while granting short-term permits for mining.

The court order discusses the power of the Provincial Government to issue notifications for the conservation of sub-soil water and prevention of erosion in certain areas. The government can also issue directions to regulate or prohibit certain activities within these areas, such as clearing land, quarrying, cutting trees, and setting fires. The order also mentions that lands notified under the PLPA are treated as "forest land" by the Forest Department, and restrictions against cutting trees apply to these areas.

The court order states that any area regarded as a forest in government records, regardless of ownership, would be considered a forest. The State of Haryana must comply with the provisions of the FC Act when using forest land for non-forestry purposes. The ongoing mining operations in the Shivalik range of hills must be regulated and monitored to protect the fragile ecology. The notification dated 14.9.2006 applies to existing mining activities, and every new contract, lease, or license of a mining area or renewal thereof shall amount to the start of a new project or activity, attracting regulatory measures. The Central Government has the power to take measures to protect and improve the environment and issue directions in that regard.

The court order discusses the requirement for prior environmental clearance for mining activities in India. The notification dated 14.9.2006 applies to existing mining activities and directs that new projects or activities, as well as expansion or modernization of existing projects, can only be undertaken after obtaining prior environmental clearance from the Central Government or State level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The court clarifies that the responsibility to obtain prior environmental clearance lies with both the State of Haryana and the private contractor/lessee. The court also emphasizes the importance of a unified approach to addressing environmental concerns for the entire mining area, rather than restricting it to individual mining zones. The court outlines the four stages of the environmental clearance process and the criteria for grant or rejection of prior environmental clearance.

The court order outlines the procedure for obtaining prior environmental clearance for mining activities in the Shivalik ranges of Himalayas, including those in District Panchkula. The State of Haryana is obligated to apply to the Expert Appraisal Committee for determining the comprehensive Terms of Reference for the preparation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report. The final report must be put to public consultation, and if it indicates the feasibility of prior environmental clearance, the State may conduct a public auction for entering into a contract/lease/licence in respect of the mining areas. Short-term permits for mining cannot be granted without issuing public notices in at least two daily newspapers, and no further permits or contracts will be granted if the requisite prior environmental clearance is not obtained within the stipulated period. The lands/areas forming part of the notification under section 3 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, are declared to be "forest lands" and cannot be used for non-forest purposes, including mining.

The court order prohibits mining activity in certain areas without prior environmental clearance and directs the State of Haryana to enforce regulations and monitor mining operations. The Notification dated 14.9.2006 is to be applied to all mining areas, and new contracts or leases for mining will be considered new activities. The State of Haryana must apply for determining the Terms of Reference and get the Environment Impact Assessment Report prepared for the entire mining area falling within the fragile Shivalik ranges of Himalayas. No public auction or grant of license/contract/
