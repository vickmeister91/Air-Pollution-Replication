The Bombay High Court issued an order on January 15, 2020, in a civil appellate jurisdiction case involving M/S. Kale Entertainment & Resorts Pvt. Ltd. and Union of India, among others. The case concerns the National Wetland Atlas for Maharashtra, which identifies 46,460 wetlands in the state. The court ordered a ban on the destruction and reclamation of wetlands identified in the Atlas and directed the Secretary of the Department of Environment and the Secretary of Forest Department, Government of Maharashtra to take a decision on whether to adopt the Atlas or prepare their own brief document. The court also directed the Secretary of the Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra to issue a circular informing all corporations and the Zilha Parishad of the court's direction.

The court order pertains to the destruction and reclamation of wetlands in Maharashtra. The Collector and Regional Officers of State Pollution Control Board have been directed to take prompt action and submit a report on the steps taken. The court has expressed displeasure at the lack of compliance with its previous orders and has directed the Principal Secretary (Environment) to appear before the court and inform about the action taken against the non-compliant officers.

The court has ordered Commissioners and District Collectors to submit brief documents on wetlands within two weeks, warning that they will be held responsible for any delay. The Principal Secretary (Environment) has presented an order from the Chief Secretary directing the Collectors and Divisional Commissioners to prepare and submit the documents or face necessary action. The court has also noted discrepancies between the data submitted by the Under Secretary, Environment Department and scientific data on the number of wetlands in certain districts, and has ordered the Principal Secretary to look into the matter and provide submissions on the adjourned date. The Petitioner will also receive copies of all brief documents prepared for wetlands in Maharashtra. The case has been adjourned to January 29th.

The court's order is significant as it seeks to protect the wetlands in Maharashtra, which are crucial for the state's ecology and biodiversity. Wetlands act as natural water filters, recharge groundwater, and provide habitat for a variety of plant and animal species. They also play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing the risk of floods and droughts.
