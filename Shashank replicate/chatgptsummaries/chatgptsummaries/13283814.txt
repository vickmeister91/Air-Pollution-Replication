Seven individuals who had been in custody since September 29, 2017, were granted bail by the court in connection with a case registered against them under Section 39, 48(ka), and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that the accused were found in possession of snakes and cobras. However, the applicants claimed to be innocent and poor, and were ready to furnish bail as per the order.

The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, or capturing of wild animals, and also regulates trade in wildlife and their products.

The accused in this case were charged under Section 39 of the Act, which deals with the hunting or poaching of wild animals, and Sections 48(ka) and 49, which deal with the possession of any wild animal, animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy. The prosecution alleged that the accused were found in possession of snakes and cobras, which are protected under the Act.

However, the accused claimed to be innocent and poor, and were ready to furnish bail as per the order. The court, after considering the arguments of both the prosecution and the accused, granted bail to the seven applicants.

The court directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court. This is a standard procedure for granting bail in criminal cases, and ensures that the accused will appear before the court on the specified dates.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to seven individuals who were in custody since September 29, 2017, in connection with a case registered against them under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused were alleged to be in possession of snakes and cobras, which are protected under the Act. However, the accused claimed to be innocent and poor, and were ready to furnish bail as per the order. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for their appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court.
