In a series of court orders related to an oil spill at Kamarajar Port in Chennai, a public interest litigant filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to take action against the fifth respondent vessel, MT Coral Stars, for causing environmental pollution and oil spill. The petitioner sought to recover costs and compensation and claimed to be a public interest litigant. The court heard arguments from both sides and directed the respondents to take action under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, and the Pollution Control Act. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had already taken action based on information received from the Coast Guard. The court did not order the detention of the vessel.

Another court order discussed a writ petition filed by a public interest litigant regarding an oil spill that occurred in Ennore port. The Coast Guard and the Ministry of Shipping have taken action under the Merchant Shipping Act, and the Kamarajar Port Trust claims to have taken action before the petition was filed. The court notes that the Coast Guard reported the spill to various authorities and issued a notice under Section 356(J) of the Merchant Shipping Act. The court also cites Section 358 of the Act, which requires immediate notice of shipping casualties to be given to the Central Government. The order includes an extract of the notice issued under Section 356(J) to the owners and master of the vessel involved in the spill.

The Indian Coast Guard has issued a notice under Section 356(J) of the Merchant Shipping Act to M/s Atlantic Shipping Private Limited and the Master of MT Coral Stars for causing an oil spill in Ennore port. The notice requires them to undertake containment and recovery of the spilled oil and take necessary action to prevent further spillage. Failure to comply may result in action under Section 356(K) of the Act. The Government of India has also taken action under Section 356(K)(2) of the Act and issued a notice to the Master/owner/charterer/authorized agent/P71 insurer/local correspondent for P&1 insurer/and all other persons interested in the vessel MT Coral Stars and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. The notice requires them to deal with the pollution damage caused due to the oil spill incident and all expenses and liabilities incurred for dealing with the said pollution incident shall be debt to the Central Government by the said vessel.

The court order states that the vessel MT Coral Stars and all parties involved in the vessel and cargo are responsible for paying the debt to the Central Government for pollution damage caused by the incident. They are also required to take necessary measures to prevent and mitigate further pollution damage and restore the environment to its original condition. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued directions to detain the vessel under Section 33A of the Water (P&CP) Act, 1974, due to the spillage of furnace oil during pipeline transfer into the harbor waters.

The court order relates to a spill of furnace oil into the sea during unloading operations from a ship at Ennore Tank Terminal Pvt Ltd. The cause of the spill was a failure in the hose pipe connecting the ship and the unloading pipeline. The spilled oil was contained within 50 meters and mostly removed by the port authorities. The court orders an assessment of the damage caused to the marine environment and the fixing of liability for the spill. The order cites relevant sections of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Hazardous & Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, which hold those involved in the handling and management of hazardous waste liable for damages caused to the environment or third parties.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued directions under the Water (P&CP) Act, 1974 to detain the ship M/s. Coral Star until liability is fixed and compensation for expenses incurred towards remediation of the marine environment affected due to the spillage of furnace oil is assessed and deposited. The Coast Guard has a duty to protect the maritime environment and prevent marine pollution. The petitioner sought a direction against the respondents to initiate prosecution and recover costs and compensation. Chapter IV and V of the Indian Coast Guard Act, 1978, deals with offenses and punishments, respectively.

The court order outlines the punishments that can be inflicted on individuals who commit offenses under the Coast Guard Act. These punishments include imprisonment, dismissal from the Coast Guard, detention, reduction in rank, forfeiture of seniority, fines, and more severe reprimands. The order also specifies that offenders include armed mutineers, rebels, rioters, pirates, and smugglers. The order allows for punishments to be awarded by a Coast Guard Court or a Commanding Officer, depending on the circumstances.

The court order outlines the punishments that can be given for civil offenses in the Coast Guard, including mulcts of pay, deprivation of good conduct badges, reprimand, extra work and drill, stoppage of leave, and admonition. It also specifies that certain punishments can only be given with approval from higher-ranking officers. The order also notes that the Coast Guard is not obligated to register complaints with the police. The case in question involved an oil spillage, which had already been mostly cleaned up by the time of the court hearing. The petition was dismissed, and no further action was required.

In summary, the court orders related to an oil spill at Kamarajar Port in
