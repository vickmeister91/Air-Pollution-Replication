The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case involving M/S Balaji Stone Industries and the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The company challenged a prohibitory order that had been passed by the board under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court ultimately permitted the petitioner to challenge the order by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal, in accordance with the law. As a result, the writ petition was disposed of with this liberty.

The case centered around a prohibitory order that had been issued by the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The order was issued under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it prohibited M/S Balaji Stone Industries from operating its stone crushing unit. The company challenged the order in court, arguing that it was arbitrary and illegal.

During the hearing, the court considered the arguments put forth by both parties. The U.P. Pollution Control Board argued that the prohibitory order was necessary to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The board claimed that the stone crushing unit was causing air and water pollution, and that it was operating without the necessary permits and clearances.

M/S Balaji Stone Industries, on the other hand, argued that the prohibitory order was arbitrary and illegal. The company claimed that it had obtained all the necessary permits and clearances, and that it was not causing any pollution. The company also argued that the board had not followed the proper procedures when issuing the order.

After considering the arguments of both parties, the court ultimately permitted M/S Balaji Stone Industries to challenge the order by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal. The court noted that the company had a right to challenge the order, and that it should do so in accordance with the law. As a result, the writ petition was disposed of with this liberty.

The decision of the Allahabad High Court has important implications for both M/S Balaji Stone Industries and the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The court's decision to permit the company to challenge the order before the National Green Tribunal means that the case is far from over. The National Green Tribunal will now have to consider the arguments put forth by both parties and make a decision on the matter.

For M/S Balaji Stone Industries, the decision is a small victory. The company will now have the opportunity to challenge the order and prove that it is not causing any pollution. However, the company will still have to deal with the prohibitory order until the matter is resolved by the National Green Tribunal.

For the U.P. Pollution Control Board, the decision is a reminder that it must follow the proper procedures when issuing orders. The board will have to ensure that it has all the necessary evidence to support its claims of pollution, and that it follows the proper procedures when issuing orders.

Overall, the decision of the Allahabad High Court highlights the importance of following the law and proper procedures when dealing with environmental issues. It also underscores the need for companies to be vigilant in protecting their rights and challenging orders that they believe are arbitrary or illegal.
