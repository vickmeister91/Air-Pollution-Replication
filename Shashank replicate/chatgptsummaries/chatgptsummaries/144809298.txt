The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of petitioners who claimed to be the owners of vehicles seized by forest or police officers on suspicion of forest offences under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners had applied for interim release of their vehicles under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but their applications were rejected on the grounds that no court had jurisdiction to order for such release due to a bar under Section 52C of the Act. The court was asked to determine whether vehicles seized under the Act can be released during the pendency of the trial by the criminal court where the trial is pending or if such power can only be exercised by the competent authority named in the Act.

The court analyzed various sections of the Act and concluded that authorized Forest Officers can order for confiscation of vehicles used in committing forest offences only after sending an intimation to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. Once the vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi. The order also cites previous Supreme Court rulings on similar provisions in other Acts and holds that a vehicle seized under the provisions of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 cannot be released during the pendency of trial on supurdgi to the registered owner by the Magistrate, where the trial is pending, in view of specific bar to jurisdiction of Court under section 52C of the Act.

The court order states that if a forest offence has been committed using a vehicle, an authorized Forest Officer may confiscate the vehicle by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded. However, the officer cannot order for such confiscation unless he sends an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. 

The court did not provide a clear answer to the question of law framed and instead referred the matter to a larger bench. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of various sections of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, and the court's analysis of previous Supreme Court rulings on similar provisions in other Acts. 

The court's decision has significant implications for the owners of vehicles seized under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The court's ruling makes it clear that once a vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi. This means that the owners of such vehicles will have to wait until the confiscation proceedings are completed before they can seek the release of their vehicles. 

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the proper procedures when confiscating vehicles under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The court's ruling makes it clear that authorized Forest Officers can order for confiscation of vehicles used in committing forest offences only after sending an intimation to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. Failure to follow these procedures could result in the confiscation being deemed illegal and the vehicle being released to its owner. 

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's recent court order has significant implications for the owners of vehicles seized under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The court's ruling makes it clear that once a vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the proper procedures when confiscating vehicles under the Act.
