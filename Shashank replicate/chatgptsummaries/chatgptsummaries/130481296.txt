The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Mr. Sathish Shetty against Mr. K Umesh Alva. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order dated 18.03.2013 in C.C.NO.27207/2011 pending on the file of the XIV A.C.M.M., Mayo Hall Unit, Bangalore. The petitioner was accused of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. 

The petitioner had sought to tender evidence by summoning a document, namely, the bank statement of the complainant of the year 2007-2008, from his banker. The trial court had rejected the application, and the petitioner had approached the High Court. The court rejected the petition, stating that the petitioner could not seek such summoning of a document as a matter of right and that the trial court had rightly rejected the application.

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is an act that regulates the negotiation and transfer of negotiable instruments, such as promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques. Section 138 of the Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer of the cheque. The section provides for criminal liability for the drawer of the cheque, and the punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or with a fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.

In the present case, the petitioner had been accused of an offence under Section 138 of the Act. The petitioner had sought to tender evidence by summoning a document, namely, the bank statement of the complainant of the year 2007-2008, from his banker. The trial court had rejected the application, and the petitioner had approached the High Court.

The High Court, in its order, observed that the petitioner could not seek such summoning of a document as a matter of right. The court noted that the power to summon a document under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, was discretionary and that the court had to exercise its discretion judiciously. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for the summoning of the document and that the trial court had rightly rejected the application.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for the summoning of the document under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court observed that the petitioner had not shown how the document was relevant to the case and how it would help in the just decision of the case. The court further observed that the petitioner had not shown that the document was in his possession or control or that he had made efforts to obtain it from other sources.

The court, therefore, rejected the petition and upheld the order of the trial court. The court observed that the trial court had rightly rejected the application for the summoning of the document and that the petitioner had not made out a case for the summoning of the document under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
