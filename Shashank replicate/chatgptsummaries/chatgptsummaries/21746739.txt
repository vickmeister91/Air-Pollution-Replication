The petitioner is facing trial for offenses under sections 376, 302, and 201 IPC in S.S.C.No.26/2015 before the Sessions Judge (Fast Track Mahila Court) Tiruvarur. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. calling for certain documents from the medical authorities to prove his innocence. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the petitioner appealed to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents called for were too vague and that the prayer for summoning them was an attempt to prolong the trial.

The case at hand involves serious criminal charges against the petitioner, including rape, murder, and destruction of evidence. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking certain documents from the medical authorities to prove his innocence. The trial court had dismissed the petition, and the petitioner had appealed to the High Court.

The High Court, in its order, noted that the documents called for by the petitioner were too vague and that the prayer for summoning them was an attempt to prolong the trial. The court observed that the petitioner had not specified which documents he required and had merely made a general prayer for summoning all documents related to the case. The court further noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means, such as by filing an application under the Right to Information Act.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to explain how the documents he sought would help in proving his innocence. The court noted that the petitioner had merely stated that the documents were necessary for a fair trial, without providing any specific reasons for the same.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for summoning the documents. The court observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to show that the documents were relevant to the case or that they would help in proving his innocence. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to show that he had exhausted all other means of obtaining the documents.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of specificity in legal petitions. The court has made it clear that vague and general prayers for relief are not sufficient and that petitioners must provide specific reasons and evidence to support their claims. The court has also emphasized the need for petitioners to exhaust all other means of obtaining information before resorting to legal petitions.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of B. Manivel v. State is a reminder of the importance of specificity and evidence in legal petitions. The court has made it clear that petitioners must provide specific reasons and evidence to support their claims and that vague and general prayers for relief are not sufficient. The court has also emphasized the need for petitioners to exhaust all other means of obtaining information before resorting to legal petitions.
