The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can be conserved and protected.

Saurav Dwivedi and Mithilesh Dwivedi were accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The specific nature of their offence is not mentioned in the court order. However, it can be assumed that they were involved in some activity that was prohibited under the act.

The court has granted anticipatory bail to the accused. Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of an arrest. This provision is available to a person who apprehends that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offence. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect the person's liberty and prevent harassment by the police.

The court has directed the accused to join the investigation and cooperate with the investigating agency and trial. This means that the accused must assist the police in their investigation and attend all court hearings. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of their bail.

The accused were to be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a separate surety. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that they will attend all court hearings and comply with the conditions of their bail. A surety is a person who undertakes to produce the accused in court if they fail to do so. The surety must also furnish a personal bond of the same amount as the accused.

The conditions of Section 438(2) of Cr.P.C were to apply during the currency of bail. Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) provides for certain conditions that must be followed by a person who has been granted anticipatory bail. These conditions include that the person must not leave India without the permission of the court, must not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses, and must cooperate with the investigation.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Saurav Dwivedi and Mithilesh Dwivedi in connection with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused were directed to join the investigation and cooperate with the investigating agency and trial. They were to be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a separate surety. The conditions of Section 438(2) of Cr.P.C were to apply during the currency of bail.
