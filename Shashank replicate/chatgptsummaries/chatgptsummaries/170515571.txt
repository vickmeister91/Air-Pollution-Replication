The Christian Medical College had filed a suit against M/s Nitin Ecotech Consultants for failing to successfully install an effluent treatment plant and obtaining payment of Rs. 10,34,750 on fraudulent misrepresentation. The plaintiff had argued that the defendants were liable to refund the entire money deposited with them once they failed to execute the project in its entirety or if they abandoned the project. However, the court held that the defendants cannot be made liable to return the amount of Rs. 10,34,750 merely on the basis of discrepancies and shortcomings in the effluent treatment plant.

The court order states that if the defendants fail to complete the project or abandon it, the hospital will be refunded the advance payment with interest. The schedule of payment has been negotiated and agreed upon by both parties. The court finds that the plaintiff has not been able to prove that the effluent treatment plant was not successfully installed and therefore, the appeal is dismissed. No substantial question of law is involved in this case.
