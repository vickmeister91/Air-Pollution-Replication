The State of Rajasthan filed a writ petition against Mohan Lal and others, challenging an order passed by the Board of Revenue in 2003. The order upheld an earlier order passed by the Revenue Appellate Authority in 2002, which cancelled the allotment of land made in favor of various persons by an order dated 15/12/2001. The land in question was declared as protected forest, but due to a printing mistake, the details of the land were not published correctly. The land was allotted to private cultivators, and these proceedings escaped the notice of the Forest Department.

The State of Rajasthan argued that the land in question was protected forest land and could not be allotted to private cultivators. The court agreed with the State's argument and granted them the liberty to move the Board of Revenue with an appropriate application and relevant documents. The writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn.

The case highlights the importance of accurate record-keeping and the need for government departments to work together to prevent such errors from occurring. The Forest Department's failure to notice the allotment of protected forest land to private cultivators is a serious lapse, and steps must be taken to ensure that such mistakes do not happen in the future.

In another court order, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi government to take action against illegal hoardings and banners in the city. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a resident of Delhi, who had raised concerns about the proliferation of illegal hoardings and banners in the city.

The court observed that the proliferation of illegal hoardings and banners was a serious issue and directed the Delhi government to take immediate action to remove them. The court also directed the government to take steps to prevent the recurrence of such violations in the future.

The court's order is a welcome step towards ensuring that public spaces are not defaced by illegal hoardings and banners. Such hoardings and banners not only spoil the aesthetic appeal of the city but also pose a risk to public safety. The Delhi government must take swift action to remove these illegal hoardings and banners and prevent their recurrence in the future.

In yet another court order, the Madras High Court directed the Tamil Nadu government to take action against illegal sand mining in the state. The court was hearing a PIL filed by an environmental activist, who had raised concerns about the environmental damage caused by illegal sand mining in the state.

The court observed that illegal sand mining was a serious issue and directed the Tamil Nadu government to take immediate action to prevent it. The court also directed the government to take steps to rehabilitate the affected areas and compensate the affected people.

The court's order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that natural resources are not exploited for personal gain. Illegal sand mining not only causes environmental damage but also poses a threat to the livelihoods of people who depend on these resources. The Tamil Nadu government must take swift action to prevent illegal sand mining and compensate the affected people.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting natural resources, preserving public spaces, and ensuring accurate record-keeping. The government must take swift action to prevent violations of the law and compensate those affected by such violations. The courts play a crucial role in upholding the law and ensuring that justice is served. It is essential that the government and the courts work together to protect the interests of the people and the environment.
