In a recent court order, a Criminal Misc. Petition filed by the accused-petitioners against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.2, Behror (District Alwar) in Criminal Revision Petition No.1/2014 was dismissed. The petitioners had requested to send the will in dispute to FSL for examination by handwriting expert. However, the court dismissed the application mainly on the ground that at the stage of framing of charge, the accused-petitioners have no such right. 

The court further observed that the FSL report has already been obtained by the prosecution during the course of investigation. The court stated that no evidence has been produced on record to show that Smt.Chand Kaur never attended meetings of the Gram Panchayat Hamirpur and none of the proceedings of the Panchayat do not bear her thumb impressions. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused-petitioners did not have the right to request an FSL examination of the will at the stage of framing of charge. The court also noted that the prosecution had already obtained an FSL report during the course of investigation. The court's decision was further supported by the lack of evidence to show that Smt.Chand Kaur never attended meetings of the Gram Panchayat Hamirpur and that none of the proceedings of the Panchayat bore her thumb impressions.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and presenting evidence to support one's case. In this case, the accused-petitioners were unable to provide sufficient evidence to support their request for an FSL examination of the will. As a result, their petition was dismissed.

It is important for individuals involved in legal proceedings to understand their rights and the legal procedures that must be followed. This includes understanding when certain requests can be made and what evidence is required to support those requests. Failure to follow proper legal procedures and provide sufficient evidence can result in unfavorable court decisions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures and presenting sufficient evidence to support one's case. It also highlights the need for individuals involved in legal proceedings to seek the guidance of legal professionals to ensure that their rights are protected and that they are following proper legal procedures.
