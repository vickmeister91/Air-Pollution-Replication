The Delhi High Court has rejected the third bail application of Dheeraj Bhasin, who is accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. The court had previously rejected two bail applications and directed the trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously. The defense argued that the trial court had failed to do so and that Bhasin was unnecessarily languishing in jail. However, the court found no new grounds to grant bail and directed the trial court to make all efforts to conclude the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments.

Dheeraj Bhasin was arrested in 2019 for allegedly hunting wild animals in the forests of Haryana and Rajasthan. He was charged under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. Bhasin had filed three bail applications in the Delhi High Court, all of which have been rejected.

The defense had argued that Bhasin was not a flight risk and that he had cooperated with the investigation. They also argued that the trial court had failed to conclude the trial expeditiously, and that Bhasin was being unnecessarily detained in jail. However, the court found no new grounds to grant bail and directed the trial court to make all efforts to conclude the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments.

The court's decision to reject Bhasin's bail application is in line with its previous orders. In its earlier orders, the court had directed the trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously and had rejected Bhasin's bail applications on the grounds that he was a flight risk and that there was a possibility of him tampering with evidence.

The court's decision to reject Bhasin's bail application is also in line with the principles of criminal law. Bail is granted to an accused person only if there are no reasonable grounds to believe that they will abscond or tamper with evidence. In Bhasin's case, the court found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he was a flight risk and that there was a possibility of him tampering with evidence.

The court's direction to the trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously is also in line with the principles of criminal law. The right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right of every accused person. Delay in the trial not only violates the accused person's right to a speedy trial, but it also affects the administration of justice.

The court's direction to the trial court to make all efforts to conclude the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments is also in line with the principles of criminal law. Adjournments are granted only if there are reasonable grounds to do so. Granting unnecessary adjournments not only delays the trial, but it also affects the administration of justice.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision to reject Dheeraj Bhasin's bail application is in line with its previous orders and the principles of criminal law. The court's direction to the trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously and to make all efforts to do so without granting unnecessary adjournments is also in line with the principles of criminal law. The court's decision and direction are a reminder that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right of every accused person, and that the administration of justice must not be delayed or obstructed by unnecessary adjournments.
