Ram Kishore, who had been in custody since April 9, 2015, for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, filed an application for bail. In his application, he stated that he was a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that he had been falsely implicated by the Forest Officer. The court allowed his bail application and directed him to furnish a bond of Rs. 35,000 with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on the given dates. The order will be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it will become ineffective.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Ram Kishore was accused of violating this law and was arrested by the Forest Officer. However, he claimed that he was innocent and that he had been falsely implicated.

In his bail application, Ram Kishore argued that he was a reputed citizen with no criminal past. He also stated that he had cooperated with the investigation and had not tried to flee from the law. He further claimed that he had been implicated by the Forest Officer, who had a personal grudge against him.

The court considered Ram Kishore's arguments and granted him bail. The court directed him to furnish a bond of Rs. 35,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. This means that Ram Kishore had to provide a sum of Rs. 35,000 as security for his release, and he had to find someone who would act as a surety and provide the same amount as security. The court also directed him to appear before the trial court on the given dates.

The court's order will be effective until the end of the trial. This means that Ram Kishore will be released on bail, but he will have to appear before the trial court on the given dates. He will also have to comply with any other conditions that the court may impose. However, if he fails to appear before the trial court or violates any of the conditions of his bail, the order will become ineffective.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody while awaiting trial. It is granted on the condition that the person will appear before the court on the given dates and comply with any other conditions that the court may impose. Bail is not a right, and it is granted at the discretion of the court.

In Ram Kishore's case, the court considered his arguments and granted him bail. The court was satisfied that he was not a flight risk and that he would cooperate with the investigation. The court also considered his reputation and his lack of criminal past. However, the court also imposed conditions on his bail to ensure that he would appear before the trial court and comply with any other conditions that the court may impose.

In conclusion, Ram Kishore, who had been in custody since April 9, 2015, for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, filed an application for bail. The court allowed his bail application and directed him to furnish a bond of Rs. 35,000 with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on the given dates. The order will be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it will become ineffective. The court's decision was based on Ram Kishore's reputation, lack of criminal past, and cooperation with the investigation. The court also imposed conditions on his bail to ensure that he would appear before the trial court and comply with any other conditions that the court may impose.
