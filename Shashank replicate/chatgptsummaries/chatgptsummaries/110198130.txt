The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by P.K. Panchaksharam against the State, represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance & Anti Corruption, Chennai City Unit IV. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Section 162 of the Indian Evidence Act seeking the production of certain documents. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents were not necessary for proving the charge framed against the petitioner and were totally unwarranted for the proceeding in Spl.C.C.No.14 of 2011.

The court also noted that the petitioner had already filed a discharge petition, which had been dismissed by the court below, and that the present petition had been filed after a lapse of four years. The court dismissed the criminal original petition and confirmed the order passed in Crl.M.P.No.697 of 2015 in Spl.C.C.No.14 of 2011.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the legal provisions under which the petitioner had filed the original petition. Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 empowers a court to issue a summons or order the production of any document or other thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 162 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that a witness may be cross-examined on any matter which tends to impeach his credit, provided that the questions are relevant to the matter in issue.

In this case, the petitioner had sought the production of certain documents under these provisions. However, the court found that the documents were not necessary for proving the charge framed against the petitioner and were totally unwarranted for the proceeding in Spl.C.C.No.14 of 2011. This suggests that the documents in question were not relevant to the matter in issue and would not have had any bearing on the outcome of the case.

The court also noted that the petitioner had already filed a discharge petition, which had been dismissed by the court below. A discharge petition is a petition filed by an accused person seeking to be discharged from the case on the grounds that there is no sufficient evidence against him. The fact that the petitioner had already filed a discharge petition suggests that he was aware of the evidence against him and had already attempted to have the case dismissed on those grounds.

Finally, the court noted that the present petition had been filed after a lapse of four years. This suggests that the petitioner had delayed in filing the petition and had not pursued the matter in a timely manner. This may have been a factor in the court's decision to dismiss the petition.

Overall, the court order in question suggests that the petitioner's request for the production of certain documents was not relevant to the matter in issue and would not have had any bearing on the outcome of the case. The fact that the petitioner had already filed a discharge petition and had delayed in filing the present petition may have also influenced the court's decision to dismiss the petition.
