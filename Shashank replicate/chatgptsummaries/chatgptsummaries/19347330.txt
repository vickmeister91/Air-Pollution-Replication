Devi Singh, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, and the revisional court, which refused to release Tractor No.RJ-34-RA-8844 along with Trolley, to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of case FIR No.119/2017, registered at Police Station Mandrayal, District Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The court considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner and observed that the tractor and trolley were not directly involved in the commission of the crime and were only used for transportation purposes. The court also noted that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

Taking into account these factors, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor along with trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of like amount. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 25,000 with the trial court as a condition for the release of the tractor and trolley.
