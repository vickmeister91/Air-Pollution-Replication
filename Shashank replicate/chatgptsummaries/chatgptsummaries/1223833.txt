The Delhi High Court recently dismissed four writ petitions filed by Saluja Builders against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The petitions sought directions to charge land price/premium at a lower rate and refund the excess amount charged along with interest. The petitioners had paid the higher rate without protest, and the court dismissed the writ petitions, stating that the petitioners cannot be treated at par with a similar case where the increase was challenged.

The court observed that the petitioners had not challenged the notification that increased the land price/premium, and therefore, they cannot seek a refund of the excess amount charged. The court further noted that the petitioners had paid the higher rate without protest, and therefore, they cannot claim that they were coerced into paying the higher rate.

The court also observed that the petitioners cannot be treated at par with a similar case where the increase was challenged. In that case, the court had directed the DDA to refund the excess amount charged along with interest. However, in the present case, the court held that the petitioners cannot seek a refund of the excess amount charged as they had not challenged the notification.

The court granted liberty to the petitioner to take out appropriate civil proceedings in accordance with the law if they wish to challenge the notification and seek a refund. The court observed that the petitioners can approach the appropriate forum to seek relief if they are aggrieved by the notification.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies that a party cannot seek a refund of the excess amount charged if they have not challenged the notification that increased the land price/premium. The court's decision also highlights the importance of challenging notifications that increase land price/premium if a party wishes to seek a refund of the excess amount charged.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision in Saluja Builders v. DDA clarifies that a party cannot seek a refund of the excess amount charged if they have not challenged the notification that increased the land price/premium. The court's decision highlights the importance of challenging notifications that increase land price/premium if a party wishes to seek a refund of the excess amount charged. The court's decision also grants liberty to the petitioner to take out appropriate civil proceedings in accordance with the law if they wish to challenge the notification and seek a refund.
