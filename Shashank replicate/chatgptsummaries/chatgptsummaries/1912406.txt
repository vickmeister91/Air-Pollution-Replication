The case in question involves a complaint filed by the appellant against the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complaint was filed on the grounds that the respondent had issued a cheque with insufficient funds. However, the learned trial Magistrate acquitted the respondent on the basis that the firm, of which the respondent was a partner, was not made a party-accused in the complaint. The High Court upheld this decision, stating that the liability of the Directors, Officers, etc. is vicarious and will flow from the liability of the company/firm. Therefore, the company/firm, which has committed the offence, has essentially to be impleaded as a party accused in the complaint otherwise the complaint will be rendered defective and liable to be dismissed.

In addition to this, the court found that there was no written demand notice served on the firm Vijay Emporium, which is the drawer of the cheque in dispute. As per the provisions of Clauses (b) and (c) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act, a written demand notice is mandatory before filing a complaint against the drawer of the cheque. The court held that the complaint against the respondent is liable to be dismissed for want of compliance with these provisions.

The appellant filed an appeal against this decision, but the court order dismissed the appeal. The court found that the order of acquittal was legal and there was no interference required. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

In summary, the court order dismisses a complaint against a respondent due to non-compliance with certain provisions of Section 138 of the Act. The court held that the liability of the Directors, Officers, etc. is vicarious and will flow from the liability of the company/firm. Therefore, the company/firm, which has committed the offence, has essentially to be impleaded as a party accused in the complaint. Additionally, the court found that a written demand notice is mandatory before filing a complaint against the drawer of the cheque. As the appellant failed to comply with these provisions, the complaint against the respondent was liable to be dismissed. The court order dismissing the appeal was deemed legal and no interference was required.
