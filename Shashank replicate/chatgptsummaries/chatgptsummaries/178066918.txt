The court recently issued an order pertaining to two appeals filed by retired Indian Army personnel who were denied allotment of land in their native places. The appellants argued that the land in question was not reserved or protected forest and therefore, they were entitled to the allotment. However, the court examined the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and held that prior approval of the Central Government was required for the diversion of any forest land and its use for non-forest purposes. 

The court also noted that the lands in question were recorded as grasslands and grazing land in revenue records. The appellants argued that the absence of a jungle or protected forest meant that the land was not subject to the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. However, the court held that the classification of the land as grasslands and grazing land was sufficient to bring it under the purview of the Act. 

The court further noted that the Revenue and Disaster Management Department had not committed any illegality or material irregularity in passing the orders denying the allotment of land to the appellants. The court dismissed the appeals and upheld the orders of the lower court. 

This order has significant implications for the allotment of land in India. It clarifies that even if land is not classified as a protected forest or jungle, it may still be subject to the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 if it is classified as grasslands or grazing land. This means that prior approval of the Central Government is required for the diversion of such land for non-forest purposes. 

The order also highlights the importance of revenue records in determining the classification of land. In this case, the fact that the land was recorded as grasslands and grazing land in revenue records was a key factor in the court's decision. This underscores the need for accurate and up-to-date revenue records to ensure that land is classified correctly and that the appropriate laws and regulations are applied. 

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and the need to balance economic development with conservation efforts. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in interpreting and enforcing laws related to land use and environmental protection.
