The Indian judiciary has been actively involved in environmental protection and conservation. In recent years, several court orders have been passed to protect the environment and prevent damage caused by human activities. Two such court orders are discussed below.

The first court order pertains to an appeal against a judgment passed by the National Green Tribunal in a case filed by a journalist concerned about environmental damage caused by certain individuals. The case involved allegations of large-scale felling of trees and blasting activities in the Himalayan region. The court directed the Forest Department and Ministry of Environment & Forests to initiate proceedings for violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 in certain private forest lands and to conduct an enquiry to find out the persons/officials responsible for the violation. The main controversy in the appeal pertained to whether Khasra No.605 was a deemed forest and would fall within the expression of forest, attracting the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is a central legislation that regulates diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act provides for prior approval of the central government for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act also defines "forest land" as any land recorded as forest in the government records, irrespective of the ownership or classification of the land. The Act also includes "deemed forests" within the definition of forest land. Deemed forests are areas that may not be recorded as forests in government records but have the characteristics of a forest, such as dense tree cover, rich biodiversity, and ecological significance.

In the present case, the main controversy was whether Khasra No.605 was a deemed forest and would fall within the expression of forest, attracting the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court relied on satellite imagery, revenue records, and reports submitted by the Forest Survey of India to conclude that Khasra No.605 was a deemed forest and would fall within the expression of forest, attracting the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court directed the Forest Department and Ministry of Environment & Forests to initiate proceedings for violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act in certain private forest lands and to conduct an enquiry to find out the persons/officials responsible for the violation.

The second court order pertains to a dispute over the classification of land as forest land and the construction of a resort on that land. The appellant argued that the land was forest land and that the construction was carried out without obtaining clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act. The respondent argued that the land was barren land and that all necessary approvals were obtained before construction. The court relied on revenue records and reports submitted by the Forest Survey of India and the joint inspection report of the forest authorities to conclude that the land in question was barren land and not forest land. The court also directed an inquiry into the proceedings related to other parcels of land. The appeal was dismissed.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is a crucial legislation for environmental protection and conservation. The Act provides for prior approval of the central government for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act also defines "forest land" as any land recorded as forest in the government records, irrespective of the ownership or classification of the land. The Act also includes "deemed forests" within the definition of forest land. Deemed forests are areas that may not be recorded as forests in government records but have the characteristics of a forest, such as dense tree cover, rich biodiversity, and ecological significance.

The court orders discussed above highlight the importance of accurate classification of land as forest land or non-forest land. The classification of land as forest land or non-forest land has significant implications for environmental protection and conservation. Forest land is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, preserving biodiversity, and mitigating climate change. Non-forest land, on the other hand, may be used for various non-forestry purposes, such as agriculture, industry, and infrastructure development. However, such activities may have adverse environmental impacts and may lead to deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of ecosystems.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed above demonstrate the commitment of the Indian judiciary to environmental protection and conservation. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is a crucial legislation for environmental protection and conservation. The accurate classification of land as forest land or non-forest land is crucial for environmental protection and conservation. The court orders highlight the need for accurate classification of land and strict enforcement of environmental laws to prevent damage caused by human activities.
