Krishan Avtar and Ramveer, residents of Gopalpur Tehsil Mandrayal, District Karauli, Rajasthan, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, which refused to release their tractor and trolley seized as case property in FIR No. 03/2018. The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, imposing certain conditions.

The petitioners had filed the petition seeking the release of their tractor and trolley, which had been seized by the police as case property in FIR No. 03/2018. The Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, had refused to release the tractor and trolley, stating that they were required as case property and that their release would hamper the investigation.

The petitioners argued that the tractor and trolley were their only means of livelihood and that their detention was causing them great hardship. They also contended that the investigation had been completed and that there was no need to keep the tractor and trolley as case property any longer.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioners. However, the court imposed certain conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley.

The court directed the petitioners to keep the vehicle and trolley intact and produce them when required by the trial court. The court also directed the petitioners to execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties. The trial court was given the power to impose any other conditions it deemed fit.

The court also directed the trial court to verify that the petitioners were the registered owners of the vehicle. The court stated that the release of the tractor and trolley was subject to the fulfillment of these conditions.

This order is significant as it highlights the importance of balancing the interests of the accused and the prosecution. While it is important to ensure that case property is not released prematurely and that investigations are not hampered, it is also important to consider the hardship that may be caused to the accused if their property is detained for an extended period of time.

In this case, the court recognized the hardship that the petitioners were facing and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley subject to certain conditions. This order is a reminder that the courts must consider the specific circumstances of each case and balance the interests of all parties involved.
