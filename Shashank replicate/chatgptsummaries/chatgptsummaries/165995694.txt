On July 18, 2017, the Supreme Court of India granted leave in the case of Manoj Chauhan vs The State of Rajasthan. The accused had been in custody since February 8, 2016, and the trial was ongoing. The charges against the accused were under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Wild Life Protection Act.

The case involved allegations of poaching and illegal possession of firearms. The accused had been denied bail by the trial court and the High Court. The Supreme Court, however, found that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period and that the trial was likely to take some time to conclude. The court also noted that the accused had no previous criminal record and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court, therefore, ordered the release of the accused on bail to the satisfaction of the trial court and allowed the trial court to impose appropriate conditions. The order of the High Court was set aside, and the appeal was disposed of accordingly.

The decision of the Supreme Court in this case highlights the importance of the right to bail in criminal cases. The right to bail is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Indian Constitution, and it is essential to ensure that the accused is not subjected to prolonged detention without trial.

The court's decision also underscores the need for the judiciary to balance the interests of the accused and the state in criminal cases. While it is essential to ensure that the accused is not subjected to undue hardship, it is equally important to ensure that the state's interest in the administration of justice is not compromised.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Manoj Chauhan vs The State of Rajasthan is a significant development in the jurisprudence of bail in criminal cases. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of the right to bail and underscores the need for the judiciary to balance the interests of the accused and the state in criminal cases.
