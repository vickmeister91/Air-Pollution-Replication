The Patna High Court has ordered the involvement of the Central Pollution Control Board in a case involving M/S UAL Industries Ltd. and the State of Bihar. The court found that the actions of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board had not been above board and that the Chairman had been delegated all the power of the State Board. The court also expressed concern about the State Board's vacillating stand and lack of independent application of mind. The court suggested that the matter should be left to an expert body and that the Guidelines laid down by the State Board should be followed by all entrepreneurs proposing to set up any industry to which the Guidelines may be applicable.

The court is surprised that the State Board has relaxed norms for asbestos manufacturing units in industrial areas, despite the entire state being declared an "Air Pollution Control Area." The court has requested assistance from the Central Pollution Control Board and has issued directions for them to answer queries and form a committee to inspect the site of the petitioner and report back to the court. The committee is to identify the location of emissions and measure them against established norms for asbestos manufacturing units.

The court has ordered a committee to inspect an asbestos manufacturing unit and submit a report with recommendations within one month. During the inspection, representatives from the State Board and the petitioner may be present. The court has rejected the petitioner's argument that the inspection should only focus on distance violations and not on established norms for setting up an asbestos manufacturing unit. The court has also stated that its observations should not be taken as final opinion or findings. Copies of the order will be given to relevant parties and authorities.

The court order requires that it be sent to the District & Sessions Judge, District Magistrate, and Superintendent of Police in Vaishali.
