In a case related to the possession of Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool, which is a scheduled animal and specified in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Hilal Ahmed Wani was convicted under section 55 of the Act. The shawls were recovered during a raid conducted by Wildlife Inspectors at Wani's residence in New Delhi in 2000. Wani managed to escape but surrendered later. The prosecution examined several witnesses, and the seized shawls were sent for expert opinion. The court convicted Wani on June 6, 2014.

The court order describes the testimony of a witness who received and analyzed woolen shawls marked as evidence in a wildlife protection case. The accused denied all allegations and argued that he was falsely implicated. The court considered arguments from both sides and found the prosecution's case to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The defense argued that the complaint was not enforceable and that the owner of the house did not support the prosecution's case. However, the court found these arguments to be unconvincing.

The court order states that documents relating to disputed shawls connecting the accused to the commission of an offense were found. The defense argues that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in the prosecution witnesses' testimony, but the court finds that the recovery has been proven by the prosecution witnesses and the accused's confession and disclosure statements. The court also notes that minor discrepancies in witness testimony are normal and should not be given too much importance. The accused's defense of being falsely implicated is not substantiated, and the court finds that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court has found the accused guilty of possessing 49 shawls, including 24 made from Tibetan Antelope (a species listed in Schedule-I of the Act), without a license or authority. The accused was involved in the business of shawls and has contravened the provisions of section 44/49 and 49B(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused will be heard on sentence. Judgment will be sent to the server www.delhidistrictcourt.nic.in.
