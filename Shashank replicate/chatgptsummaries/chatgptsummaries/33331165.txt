The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioners were accused of mining on forest land without permission. The land in question was acquired under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition & Development) Act, 1957 in 1964, and mining was going on smoothly until the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came into force. The matter was taken to the Supreme Court, which gave the option to file an application under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 before the Central Government.

The petitioners had been mining on forest land without permission, which was a violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Supreme Court gave them the option to file an application under Section 2 of the Act before the Central Government. The Central Government then passed an order on 08.06.2004 with respect to diversion of 52.97 hectares of forest land for 'Pundi Open Cast Mining Project' in favour of Central Coalfields Limited on certain terms and conditions.

The court ordered the matter to be listed after four weeks for further verification. This means that the court will review the order passed by the Central Government and ensure that all the terms and conditions have been met. The court will also verify that the mining project is being carried out in accordance with the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to protect forests and wildlife in India. It prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act also requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes must be compensated by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.

In this case, the petitioners had been mining on forest land without permission, which was a violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Supreme Court gave them the option to file an application under Section 2 of the Act before the Central Government. The Central Government then passed an order allowing the diversion of forest land for the mining project, but on certain terms and conditions.
