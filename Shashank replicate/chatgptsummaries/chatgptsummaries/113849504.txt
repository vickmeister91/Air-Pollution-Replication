The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the illegal possession of animal skins from protected wildlife species. In the first case, two individuals were accused of carrying wildlife animal skins, but one of the accused passed away during the trial. The prosecution presented four witnesses, including police officials who testified to the recovery of the skins. However, the accused pleaded not guilty and was ultimately acquitted of the charges.

In the second case, two accused individuals were apprehended by police officials based on secret information that they were carrying wild animal skins. The wildlife officials were informed and identified the skins, which were taken into police possession. The prosecution presented witnesses and evidence, but the accused claimed they were falsely implicated and did not present any defense evidence. The court ultimately found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.

The third case involved the illegal possession of animal skins from protected wildlife species. The court found that while one accused was clearly involved in the crime, there was not enough evidence to convict the other accused. The court explained that possession of the illegal items must be conscious and intentional, and there was no evidence that the second accused was aware of the contents of the parcel. Therefore, the court could not impose criminal liability on the second accused.

In the fourth case, the court found that there was no evidence to prove that the accused, Suresh, knew the contents of a parcel containing wildlife animal skins. The prosecution's argument that Suresh was aware of the contents was based on presumption without any evidence. The court also stated that previous conduct and confessions of the accused in other cases could not be used as evidence against him in this case. The prosecution failed to prove conscious possession of the accused regarding the recovered articles, and therefore, Suresh was entitled to be acquitted. The court gave the benefit of doubt to Suresh and acquitted him of the charges.

Finally, in the fifth case, Suresh and another accused were acquitted of charges related to wildlife. The order was on page 11 of the judgment, and the case involved Raj Kumar and another person.

In all of these cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused were ultimately acquitted of the charges. The court emphasized the importance of conscious and intentional possession of illegal items and the need for evidence to support the prosecution's case. The court also noted that previous conduct and confessions in other cases could not be used as evidence against the accused in the current case. Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of a thorough and well-supported prosecution case in cases involving the illegal possession of protected wildlife species.
