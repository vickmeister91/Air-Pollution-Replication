The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Om Prakash and others against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canals and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court order lists various dates and orders passed by the NGT in the matter.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to clean up canal waters and its distributories, and to collect water samples for analysis. The compliance report showed that water samples from the distributories could not be collected due to maintenance work, but the clean water reservoir samples were normal. The court directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the water quality. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court also imposed a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the State to make citizens aware of this penalty. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case to them. The State was directed to submit a comprehensive short and long term plan for cleaning up the canal and distributories and to provide a report on the action taken. The District Collector of Ganga Nagar was ordered to be present with relevant records on the next hearing date.

The court order directs the State of Rajasthan to furnish copies of compliance reports and remove all encroachments on canals providing drinking water within one month. The District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner of Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust are to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State is also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to remove structures meant for canal maintenance that are contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The compliance report is to be filed by January 29, 2016, and those who resist the claim for compensation shall be directed to be present before the Tribunal.

The court ordered the State Government to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000 to be deposited in the Environment Relief Fund. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and for the State to file a compliance report. The court expressed disappointment with the State's lack of compliance and gave them another opportunity to comply before taking appropriate action. The court also directed the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that those aggrieved with the State's actions should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases related to environmental issues. The court also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy, if that is efficacious. In this particular case, the court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction and allows the petitioner(s) to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and it is expected that while entertaining the application/representations filed by the aggrieved persons, the NGT will consider that the delay has been caused in approaching to it as the writ petition was pending before this Court.
