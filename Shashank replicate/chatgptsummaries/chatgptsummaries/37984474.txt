The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to writ petitions filed by various transport associations challenging the legality of notifications issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) in Delhi fixing maximum speed limits for different types of vehicles.

The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the All Haryana Tourist Transport Welfare Association seeking to quash an order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) and a declaration that Rule 9(1) of the Delhi Control of Vehicular & other Traffic and Road and Street Regulations, 1980 is bad in law. The petition also challenges a notification issued by the Delhi Traffic Police fixing the maximum speed limit for all transport vehicles including TSRs at 40 kmph and for cars, jeep, two-wheelers etc. at 60 kmph. The court allowed an application for amendment of the writ petition to challenge the notification dated 25th January 2008.

The second court order discusses the legality of a notification issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Delhi, which fixed maximum speed limits for call center cabs. The court found that the notification was within the scope of the power conferred on the Deputy Commissioner of Police by the Act and the Regulations in fixing the speed limits. The court also rejected the argument that call center cabs cannot be treated as light commercial vehicles and found that there was a reasonable nexus between the speed limit stipulated by the impugned notifications and the legitimate aim of ensuring safe driving of call center cabs. The writ petition was dismissed with no order as to costs.

The third court order dismissed a writ petition and a pending application, finding no merit in the argument that the notifications in question were unreasonable or arbitrary. No costs were awarded. The order was issued on January 15, 2009, by S. Muralidhar, J. and the Chief Justice.

In all three court orders, the legality of notifications issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) in Delhi fixing maximum speed limits for different types of vehicles was challenged. The court in the first order allowed an application for amendment of the writ petition to challenge the notification dated 25th January 2008. The court in the second order found that the notification fixing maximum speed limits for call center cabs was within the scope of the power conferred on the Deputy Commissioner of Police by the Act and the Regulations in fixing the speed limits. The court in the third order dismissed the writ petition and pending application, finding no merit in the argument that the notifications in question were unreasonable or arbitrary.

Overall, the court orders suggest that the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) in Delhi has the power to fix maximum speed limits for different types of vehicles and that such notifications are within the scope of the law. The court also found that there was a reasonable nexus between the speed limit stipulated by the impugned notifications and the legitimate aim of ensuring safe driving of vehicles.
