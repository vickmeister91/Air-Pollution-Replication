The Karnataka High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by Sri Shridhar Shetty against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had been granted a stone quarrying lease in 2011, which was up for renewal in 2016. However, the renewal application was rejected on the grounds that the land was a deemed forest. The petitioner challenged this rejection, and the court quashed the endorsement and set aside the rejection.

The court observed that the land in question was not a deemed forest as per the definition provided under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court also noted that the land had been classified as a non-forest area by the Deputy Conservator of Forests in 2003. The court further observed that the petitioner had been granted a lease for stone quarrying in the area in 2011, and the renewal application was rejected without any proper inquiry or investigation.

The court held that the rejection of the renewal application was arbitrary and illegal. The court also noted that the petitioner had been carrying out stone quarrying activities in the area for several years and had invested a significant amount of money in the business. The court observed that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that the renewal application would be granted, and the rejection had caused him significant financial loss.

The court, therefore, quashed the endorsement and set aside the rejection of the renewal application. The court ordered that the renewal application be considered afresh in light of a previous judgment and that a fresh order be passed within three months. The court also directed the authorities to conduct a proper inquiry and investigation before passing the fresh order.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the principle of natural justice and fairness. The court has held that the authorities cannot reject a renewal application without proper inquiry or investigation. The court has also recognized the legitimate expectation of the petitioner and has ordered that the renewal application be considered afresh.

The court's order is also significant as it clarifies the definition of a deemed forest. The court has held that the land in question is not a deemed forest as per the definition provided under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. This clarification is important as it will prevent arbitrary rejection of renewal applications on the grounds that the land is a deemed forest.

The court's order is a welcome development for the petitioner and other stakeholders in the stone quarrying industry. The order provides clarity on the definition of a deemed forest and upholds the principle of natural justice and fairness. The order also recognizes the legitimate expectation of the petitioner and provides a remedy for the financial loss suffered by him.
