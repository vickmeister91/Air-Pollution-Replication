The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Gavisiddeshwara Enterprises against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had entered into an agreement with the Forest Department and had obtained necessary approvals for conducting mining operations in a forest area. However, based on allegations of violation of lease conditions, an FIR was registered against the petitioner by the Forest Department. The petitioner sought to quash the FIR and the order of seizure of vehicles and tools.

The court considered several questions, including whether the report of the Lokayukta can be the basis for the FIR and whether the court can quash the report. The court held that the Lokayukta report can be a basis for initiating action against illegal acts, but the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to be heard before initiating the action. The court did not quash the FIR but allowed the seized articles to be returned to the petitioner on certain conditions.

The court order states that the petitioner cannot be opposed without natural justice, and the exercise of administrative powers will be vitiated if there is a manifest error or arbitrary exercise of power. The fact that the petitioner was not given an opportunity before initiating an action based on the Lokayukta report or the sketches enclosed to the report cannot be a ground to quash the orders. The electronic evidence is admissible in evidence, and the respondents are entitled to place reliance on the satellite imagery, but it needs to be substantiated by the respondents before the competent authority. The court cannot conclude that at the prima facie stage, no case was made out.

The mining lease granted before the commencement of the Forest (Conservation) Act is renewed after its coming into force. The impugned quarry is located in the forest area, and the mining lease granted to the petitioner in such a forest area is subject to the conditions imposed by the Central Government and State Government while exercising the power conferred under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The fourth respondent is empowered to suspend the mining license if the conditions agreed to by the petitioner in the agreement are violated. The decisions rendered in Writ Petition No.60023 of 2009 and Writ Petition No.3812 of 2009 apply to the facts of the present case.

The court rejects the plea to quash the First Information Report and gives liberty to the respondents to proceed in accordance with the law, subject to the orders given in the court. The court has ordered an inspection and survey of the leased out area to determine if there has been any illegal mining outside of the designated area. If any forest land has been illegally mined, the petitioner will be responsible for damages. The court has also directed the respondents to return tools, vehicles, and machinery to the petitioner and permit them to continue mining in the designated area. The writ petition has been disposed of.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Gavisiddeshwara Enterprises against the State of Karnataka.
