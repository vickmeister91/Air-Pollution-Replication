The court order pertains to two separate petitions filed by M/s Srishti Infrastructure Ltd seeking the quashing of orders passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) restraining the felling and cutting of trees in the state of Punjab and the suspension of an impugned order concerning NH-71. The petitioner had invested in a project for the construction of a District Administrative Complex and residence of the Deputy Commissioner at Nawanshahar (SBS Nagar) and had made full payment for felling and cutting the trees for which necessary permissions had been granted.

The first petition challenged the NGT's order restraining the entire state of Punjab from felling and cutting any tree. The court disposed of the writ petition in terms of the order passed by the Supreme Court of India in an appeal arising out of the same order dated 19.05.2016 passed by the learned Tribunal. The Supreme Court had suspended the impugned order for a period of four months from 28.10.2016 to enable the State Government to execute the ongoing project mentioned above and also the other projects which are likely to be affected by the impugned order.

The second petition challenged the operation of an impugned order concerning NH-71. The court suspended the operation of the order for four months to allow the petitioner to execute an ongoing project in accordance with the law and necessary permissions. The court left it open for the parties to raise any contentions in law before the Tribunal. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly.

The court's decision in both petitions was based on the Supreme Court's order suspending the NGT's impugned order for a period of four months. The Supreme Court had allowed the State Government to execute ongoing projects that were likely to be affected by the NGT's order. The court's decision in the first petition was in line with the Supreme Court's order, which had suspended the NGT's order for four months to enable the State Government to execute ongoing projects. The court's decision in the second petition was also in line with the Supreme Court's order, which had allowed the petitioner to execute an ongoing project in accordance with the law and necessary permissions.

The court's decision in both petitions was significant as it allowed the State Government and the petitioner to execute ongoing projects without any hindrance from the NGT's order. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of balancing environmental concerns with development projects. The court's decision was a reminder that development projects must be executed in accordance with the law and necessary permissions, and that environmental concerns must be taken into account while executing such projects.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the two petitions filed by M/s Srishti Infrastructure Ltd was based on the Supreme Court's order suspending the NGT's impugned order for a period of four months. The court allowed the State Government and the petitioner to execute ongoing projects in accordance with the law and necessary permissions.
