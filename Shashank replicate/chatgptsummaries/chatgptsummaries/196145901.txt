In a recent court order, a petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for a writ of Mandamus. The petitioner sought direction to the first respondent to determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the first respondent to pass a reasoned speaking order in a just, fair, and dispassionate manner within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

The writ of Mandamus is a legal remedy that is used to compel a public official or body to perform a duty that they are legally obligated to perform. In this case, the petitioner sought a writ of Mandamus to compel the first respondent to determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956.

The National Highways Act, 1956, provides for the acquisition of land for the construction of national highways. The Act also provides for the determination of compensation to be paid to the landowners whose land is acquired for the construction of national highways. The compensation is to be determined as per the market value of the land at the time of acquisition.

The petitioner argued that the first respondent had not determined the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and had not determined the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956. The petitioner sought a writ of Mandamus to compel the first respondent to perform their duty and determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the first respondent to pass a reasoned speaking order in a just, fair, and dispassionate manner within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The court's order is a clear indication that the first respondent is legally obligated to determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956.

The court's order is a significant victory for the petitioner, as it ensures that the first respondent will be compelled to perform their duty and determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956. The court's order also serves as a reminder to public officials and bodies that they are legally obligated to perform their duties and that they can be compelled to do so through legal remedies such as the writ of Mandamus.

In conclusion, the recent court order in which a petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for a writ of Mandamus is a significant victory for the petitioner. The court's order directs the first respondent to determine the compensation as per the market value of the lands acquired and to determine the Additional Compensation sought as per the Application dated 23.08.2012 in accordance with the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956. The court's order serves as a reminder to public officials and bodies that they are legally obligated to perform their duties and that they can be compelled to do so through legal remedies such as the writ of Mandamus.
