In the first court order, the writ petition filed by Praveen Kumar, an employee of the Export Inspection Council of India, challenging his temporary posting to the Export Inspection Agency in Chennai was rejected. Kumar argued that the posting violated the transfer policy and was mala fide due to personal grievances against him. However, the court rejected all of Kumar's arguments and upheld the temporary posting order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the transfer policy allowed for temporary postings and that there was no evidence of mala fide intentions on the part of the employer. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim of personal grievances. Therefore, the court found no reason to interfere with the temporary posting order.

In the second court order, the court refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction in a case where the petitioner had not reported for duty with the employer for nine months after the impugned order was passed. The court stated that if the petitioner's actions were bona fide, they should have reported for duty and then sought permission for study leave. The court also noted that an employee cannot take a recalcitrant stand and refuse to report for duty for over nine months and still claim discretionary relief. The court dismissed the writ petition and all pending applications.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not followed the proper procedure for seeking study leave and had instead chosen to take a recalcitrant stand. The court noted that an employee cannot refuse to report for duty for an extended period of time and still expect to receive discretionary relief. Therefore, the court found no reason to grant relief to the petitioner.

In both court orders, the court emphasized the importance of following proper procedures and adhering to the rules and regulations set forth by the employer. The court also noted that employees cannot take a recalcitrant stand and refuse to report for duty for an extended period of time. These court orders serve as a reminder to employees to follow proper procedures and to employers to ensure that their actions are in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the organization.
