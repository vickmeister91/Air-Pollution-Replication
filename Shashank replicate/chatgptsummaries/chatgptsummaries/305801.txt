The Orissa High Court recently heard a case in which the State Prevention and Control of Pollution Board filed a complaint against the Berhampur Municipality and its Executive Officer for contravening the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The case revolved around the question of whether Section 197(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires the sanction of the State Government for initiating a proceeding against a public servant accused of an offence committed while acting in the discharge of their official duty, applied to the case.

The court held that since Section 49 of the Act, which requires the complaint to be made with the previous sanction in writing of the State Board, had been complied with, it was not necessary to insist upon a second sanction from the State Government before proceeding with the criminal case. The court allowed the revision petition and directed the learned Magistrate to proceed with the case and dispose of it in accordance with the law.

The case was brought before the court by the State Prevention and Control of Pollution Board, which had filed a complaint against the Berhampur Municipality and its Executive Officer for contravening the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Board alleged that the Municipality and its Executive Officer had failed to take adequate measures to prevent and control water pollution in the area under their jurisdiction.

The Municipality and its Executive Officer argued that the complaint was not maintainable as it had not been filed with the previous sanction of the State Government, as required by Section 197(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. They contended that since the Executive Officer was a public servant and the alleged offence had been committed while he was acting in the discharge of his official duty, the sanction of the State Government was necessary before any criminal proceedings could be initiated against him.

The court examined the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and noted that Section 49 of the Act required the complaint to be made with the previous sanction in writing of the State Board. The court held that since this requirement had been complied with, it was not necessary to insist upon a second sanction from the State Government before proceeding with the criminal case.

The court also noted that the purpose of Section 197(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code was to protect public servants from frivolous and vexatious prosecutions. However, in the present case, the court found that the complaint had been filed by the State Prevention and Control of Pollution Board, which was a statutory body responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court held that the Board was not a private party and that its complaint could not be considered frivolous or vexatious.

In light of these findings, the court allowed the revision petition and directed the learned Magistrate to proceed with the case and dispose of it in accordance with the law. The court's decision clarifies the requirements for initiating criminal proceedings against public servants accused of offences committed while acting in the discharge of their official duty and underscores the importance of complying with the relevant provisions of the law.
