The court order pertains to two writ petitions that raise common issues. The petitioners seek a declaration that a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2011 is not applicable to mining projects/units that already possess valid and subsisting environmental clearances. The court discusses the relevant provisions of the notifications and notes that the 2006 notification requires prior environmental clearance for new projects or activities listed in the Schedule. The court also highlights the validity period of environmental clearance granted for a project or activity.

The court order states that an environmental clearance (EC) is required for new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the Notification of 2006, expansion and modernization of existing projects or activities listed in the Schedule, and any change in product-mix in an existing manufacturing unit included in the Schedule beyond the specified range. The validity of the EC is for 10 years in the case of river valley projects, for the project life as estimated by the Expert Appraisal Committee or the State level Expert Appraisal Committee subject to a maximum of 30 years in the case of mining projects, and for five years in the case of other projects. The court also discusses an amendment introduced in the Notification of 2011, which requires prior environmental clearance even at the stage of renewal of a mining lease. The court examines the contentions of the EC granted to M/s S.N. Mohanty and the need for an EC at the renewal stage.

The court order discusses the conditions and safeguards required for mining operations to obtain environmental clearance. The specific and general conditions include monitoring of groundwater levels, forestry clearance, noise control, and proper treatment of industrial waste water. The court also examines a notification requiring an environmental clearance at the renewal stage, even for those who already have a valid clearance. The respondents argue that the notification is necessary to conform to the Supreme Court's directions in a previous case. The court examines the scope of the notification and the Supreme Court's directions and ultimately upholds the notification.

The court order states that the obligation to society must take precedence over the obligation to individuals. The court also ruled that the Forest Conservation Act applies to lease renewals and that the grant of renewal must be consistent with the law. The court further clarified that if a person has a valid and subsisting environmental clearance at the time of seeking a renewal of a mining lease, they would not be required to obtain another clearance prior to the grant of renewal. The court allowed the writ petitions and declared that the amendment introduced to Colum No.5 of the Schedule 1(a) of the Notification of 2006 would not apply to mining projects/units that already possess valid and subsisting environmental clearances.
