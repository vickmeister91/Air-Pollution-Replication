The Supreme Court of India recently passed a significant order in a case involving Bayer India Ltd. and others. The case pertained to the construction of buildings in an area reserved for industrial use. The Bombay High Court had initially directed the Municipal Corporation to re-examine the building plans, but later dismissed the intervention application of the respondents and directed the Corporation to permit construction. The Supreme Court, however, directed the High Court to dispose of the review application and maintain status quo, preventing construction activity within one km radius from the factory premises.

The High Court disposed of the review application by giving certain directions, which were challenged in the present appeals. The Supreme Court was of the view that the immunity granted to the industrialists had caused injustice to the residents of the locality, leaving them exposed to the risk of losing their lives. The Court directed the constitution of an Authority under section 3(3) of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, to examine the question of relocation of the factories.

The Authority was to submit its report to the Central Government within three months after examining and deciding all the relevant issues. The Court also directed the Bombay Municipal Corporation to re-examine the question of grant of sanction on the basis of the existing rules and bye-laws, but to await the result of the Authority's report. The review petitions filed before the High Court by the respondents were not required to be kept alive and would stand dismissed on withdrawal.

The case had been ongoing for some time, with the industrialists seeking permission to construct buildings in an area reserved for industrial use. The High Court had initially directed the Municipal Corporation to re-examine the building plans, but later dismissed the intervention application of the respondents and directed the Corporation to permit construction. The Supreme Court, however, directed the High Court to dispose of the review application and maintain status quo, preventing construction activity within one km radius from the factory premises.

The Supreme Court's order was significant as it recognized the potential harm that could be caused to the residents of the locality if the industrialists were allowed to construct buildings in an area reserved for industrial use. The Court was of the view that the immunity granted to the industrialists had caused injustice to the residents of the locality, leaving them exposed to the risk of losing their lives.
