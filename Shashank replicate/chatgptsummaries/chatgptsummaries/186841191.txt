In a recent court order, the petitioner had given two cheques to an advocate who issued a receipt in favor of the petitioner. However, the original receipt was not available with the petitioner, and he wanted to prove its photostat copy by way of secondary evidence. The petitioner had earlier applied to summon the original receipt, but the application was dismissed by the court. The court found no illegality in the impugned order dismissing the application for leading secondary evidence and therefore dismissed the case.

The case highlights the importance of maintaining original documents and the difficulties that can arise when only copies are available. In this case, the petitioner was unable to produce the original receipt and had to rely on a photostat copy as secondary evidence. However, the court found that the earlier application to summon the original receipt had been dismissed, and therefore the petitioner could not rely on the photostat copy as evidence.

The court's decision was based on the principle of secondary evidence, which allows a party to produce a copy of a document when the original is not available. However, the party must first establish that the original document is not available and that reasonable efforts have been made to locate it. In this case, the court found that the petitioner had failed to establish that the original receipt was not available and that reasonable efforts had been made to locate it.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when attempting to produce evidence in court. The petitioner had earlier applied to summon the original receipt, but the application was dismissed by the court. The court found no illegality in the impugned order dismissing the application for leading secondary evidence, indicating that the petitioner had not followed proper legal procedures in attempting to produce evidence.

Overall, the court's decision emphasizes the importance of maintaining original documents and following proper legal procedures when attempting to produce evidence in court. The case serves as a reminder to parties to take all necessary steps to preserve original documents and to follow proper legal procedures when attempting to produce evidence in court. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of a case, as was the case in this instance.
