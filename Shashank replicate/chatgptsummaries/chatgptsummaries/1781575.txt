In a recent court order, Janthakal Enterprises has been granted permission to lift iron ore that has already been extracted and quantified, subject to certain conditions. The case was between Janthakal Enterprises and the State of Karnataka. The lifting operation must be completed within six weeks of the date of the order or the production of a certified copy of the order. However, the petitioner must pay various amounts, including royalty, damage of forest land, net present value, compensatory afforestation charges, and other statutory dues before lifting the iron ore.

The order has been modified to correct typographical errors and allow the petitioner to adjust the present value amount towards the amount payable for granting permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act. This means that the petitioner can use the present value amount towards the amount payable for permission under the Forest Conservation Act. This is a significant relief for Janthakal Enterprises as it reduces the financial burden on the company.

The court order has been issued with the aim of balancing the interests of both parties. On the one hand, Janthakal Enterprises has been allowed to lift the iron ore that has already been extracted and quantified. On the other hand, the State of Karnataka has ensured that the petitioner pays all the necessary dues before lifting the iron ore. This ensures that the state receives its due share of revenue and that the environment is protected.

The court order has also set a deadline of six weeks for the lifting operation to be completed. This is a reasonable time frame and ensures that the petitioner does not delay the lifting operation. The deadline also ensures that the state receives its revenue in a timely manner.

The court order has been modified to correct typographical errors. This is a common practice in court orders and ensures that the order is clear and unambiguous. The modification also allows the petitioner to adjust the present value amount towards the amount payable for granting permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act. This is a significant relief for the petitioner as it reduces the financial burden on the company.

In conclusion, the court order between Janthakal Enterprises and the State of Karnataka has allowed the petitioner to lift iron ore that has already been extracted and quantified, subject to certain conditions. The lifting operation must be completed within six weeks of the date of the order or the production of a certified copy of the order. The petitioner must pay various amounts, including royalty, damage of forest land, net present value, compensatory afforestation charges, and other statutory dues before lifting the iron ore. The order has been modified to correct typographical errors and allow the petitioner to adjust the present value amount towards the amount payable for granting permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act.
