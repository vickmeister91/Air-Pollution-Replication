The Madras High Court recently dismissed a Civil Revision Petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner had sought an order to set aside the order, dated 30.01.2013 made in I.A.Sr.No.481 of 2013 in O.S.No.5 of 2013 on the file of the Principal District Munsif, Kanchipuram. The petitioner had sought to reject the plaint, but the court found that there was legal cause of action to maintain the suit and the relief sought for in the plaint was legally sustainable.

The court directed the trial court to dispose of the suit within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. This decision was made after a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court found that the petitioner had failed to establish any grounds for setting aside the order of the trial court.

The petitioner had argued that the plaint was not maintainable as it did not disclose any cause of action. However, the court found that the plaint did disclose a cause of action and that the relief sought for in the plaint was legally sustainable. The court also noted that the trial court had taken into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case before passing the order.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not raised any substantial question of law that required the intervention of the court. The court held that the trial court had correctly applied the law to the facts of the case and that there was no reason to interfere with the order passed by the trial court.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the Civil Revision Petition and directed the trial court to dispose of the suit within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. This decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of establishing a legal cause of action before filing a suit and highlights the need for parties to carefully consider the facts and circumstances of their case before approaching the court.

Overall, the decision of the Madras High Court in this case serves as a reminder to litigants that they must have a valid legal cause of action before filing a suit and that the court will not interfere with the decisions of lower courts unless there are substantial questions of law involved. It also emphasizes the importance of timely disposal of cases and the need for courts to ensure that justice is delivered in a timely and efficient manner.
