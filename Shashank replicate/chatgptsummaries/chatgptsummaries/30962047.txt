The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Pandiaraj, was charged with offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to call for the call details and other records of his mobile phone from the service provider for the date 03.03.2016, which was dismissed by the Trial Court on 31.05.2017. The petitioner challenged this order in the Madras High Court, which dismissed the petition, stating that the call details with regard to 03.03.2016 were not relevant to decide the facts in issue and that the service provider would have the records only for a period of three months and not beyond that.

The case in question involves serious charges against the petitioner, Pandiaraj, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. In an attempt to defend himself against these charges, Pandiaraj filed a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to call for the call details and other records of his mobile phone from the service provider for the date 03.03.2016. However, this petition was dismissed by the Trial Court on 31.05.2017.

Undeterred, Pandiaraj challenged this order in the Madras High Court. However, the High Court also dismissed the petition, stating that the call details with regard to 03.03.2016 were not relevant to decide the facts in issue. The court also noted that the service provider would have the records only for a period of three months and not beyond that.

The dismissal of Pandiaraj's petition by both the Trial Court and the Madras High Court is significant for a number of reasons. Firstly, it highlights the importance of relevance in legal proceedings. The courts have made it clear that evidence must be directly relevant to the facts in issue in order to be admissible. In this case, the call details for 03.03.2016 were deemed irrelevant to the charges against Pandiaraj, and therefore were not admissible.

Secondly, the case also highlights the importance of timing in legal proceedings. The service provider was only required to keep records for a period of three months, and therefore the call details for 03.03.2016 were no longer available. This serves as a reminder that evidence must be obtained in a timely manner in order to be admissible in court.

Finally, the case also serves as a warning to those who may be tempted to engage in illegal activities. The charges against Pandiaraj are serious, and the fact that his attempts to obtain evidence in his defense were dismissed by both the Trial Court and the Madras High Court suggests that the evidence against him is strong. This case serves as a reminder that those who engage in illegal activities will be held accountable for their actions, and that attempts to evade justice will not be successful.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Pandiaraj, was charged with offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The dismissal of his petition by both the Trial Court and the Madras High Court highlights the importance of relevance and timing in legal proceedings, and serves as a warning to those who may be tempted to engage in illegal activities.
