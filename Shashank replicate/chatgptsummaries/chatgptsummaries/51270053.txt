The court order in question is related to a writ petition filed by Pushparajan, who had submitted an application for a quarrying permit. The Geologist had passed an order stating that the application cannot be considered without the petitioner obtaining an environmental clearance certificate. The petitioner argued that since the construction proposed was for a building with a plinth area less than 20,000 sq. meters, an environmental clearance certificate was not required. The court agreed with the petitioner and directed the 1st respondent to consider the application without insisting on an environmental clearance certificate. The respondent was given two weeks to consider the application.
