The court order pertains to multiple cases involving various sugar factories and government bodies in Maharashtra state. The cases involve issues related to sugar production and distribution, including the grant of aerial distance certificates, construction of new sugar factories, and dumping of waste products into water reservoirs. The court heard all the matters together and disposed of them by a common judgment.

One of the cases involved a dispute over the setting up of a new sugar factory within a 15 km radius of existing sugar factories. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the proposed factory was more than 15 km away from existing factories, but this was challenged by other parties. The court considered the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which outline the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory. These include obtaining a certificate from the Cane Commissioner or Director (Sugar) or Specified Authority of the concerned State Government that the distance between the proposed site and adjacent existing sugar factories and new sugar factories is not less than the minimum distance prescribed by the Central Government or the State Government. The concerned person must also file an Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government within one month of obtaining the certificate and submit a performance guarantee of rupees one crore to Chief Director (Sugar), Department of Food and Public Distribution, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution within thirty days of filing the memorandum. The stipulated time for taking effective steps is two years and commercial production must commence within four years from the date of filing the memorandum with the Central Government.

The court order specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but who have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court also heard arguments from both sides regarding the grant of aerial distance certificates.

Another case involved a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court considers the provisions of the Sugarcane Control Order and a previous court decision in Gangamai. The court ultimately finds that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was first in point of time and therefore justified, despite objections from Lokshakti. The court also rejects Lokshakti's argument that Audumbarraoji used documents belonging to a different entity to obtain the certificate.

The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their facilities at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The petitioner argued that the IEM granted to one factory had become inoperative due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966. The court rejected this argument and found that the IEM was still valid.

In another case, the court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting an aerial distance certificate to one sugar factory and refusing it to the other. The court also considered arguments from both sides regarding the factory's compliance with government regulations and the validity of its change in location. The court ultimately concluded that the change in location is permissible and that the factory has taken effective steps within the required time frame.

The court also addressed a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application for an amendment to their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM) to correct the location of their proposed sugar factory. The court determined that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement dated January 12, 2006, was to be treated as a fresh IEM registered in favor of Jaywant for the first time. The court also considered whether Audumbarraoji has taken effective steps within the stipulated period of two years from the date of IEM. The court found that effective steps were taken by Audumbarraoji within the stipulated time. The court also rejected the argument that the Director (Sugar) is not the authority that issues the IEM and that there is no provision for change of location in the IEM.

The court had previously restrained the construction of a sugar factory on agricultural land without obtaining necessary permissions from the authorities. The Collector submitted a report stating that the petitioner had obtained all necessary permissions. The petitioner then commenced construction, but the court again restrained them on the grounds that an aerial distance certificate was not obtained for the changed location of the factory. The court had previously addressed the issue of the unauthorized change in location.

In another case, the court accepted the report of the Competent Authority - Collector that the necessary permissions have been obtained by a sugar factory located on a plot of land in village Aashti. The court also dismissed three writ petitions challenging the establishment of the factory on the grounds that the petitioners have no locus standi or legal right to object to the grant of aerial distance certificate or the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum to the factory. The court vacated all interim orders passed
