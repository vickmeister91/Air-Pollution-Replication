The petitioner sought to quash a direction issued by the Karnataka State Coastal Zone Management Authority under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court observed that while a statutory remedy of an appeal is available to the petitioner, the jurisdiction of the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India remains unaffected. However, as a rule of prudence, a writ petition should not be entertained. The court directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal and extended the interim relief for a period of three months.
