The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Dr. M Sudheendra Rao, the former Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, challenging the notification issued by the State Government on May 2, 2020, determining his Chairmanship by virtue of his resignation allegedly given by him. The petitioner argued that the resignation letter was fabricated and not addressed to the Government as required by the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. 

The court order discusses the doctrine of election and estoppel, stating that taking inconsistent pleas is unsatisfactory and parties should not take inconsistent stands. The case in question involves a disputed resignation letter, but the court finds that the letter is indeed a resignation letter and discusses the validity and effectiveness of the letter in the eye of the law. The argument that the letter does not qualify as a resignation because it was not addressed to the state government is difficult to accept, and the court notes that normally a resignation by an employee needs acceptance by the employer or competent authority to be effective. However, in this case, the act of resignation is apparently unilateral and does not require acceptance by the government for its efficacy.

The court order discusses the resignation of a Chairman of the Board and whether it was effective. The court concludes that the act of relinquishing the office of Chairman is unilateral and effective when communicated, without any further action required. The court also discusses the meaning of "State Government" and concludes that it refers to the authority or person authorized to exercise executive powers on behalf of the government. The court cites various legal precedents to support its conclusions.

The court order discusses the role of the Chief Minister in the Karnataka government and how it relates to the resignation of a government official. The court cites various rules and constitutional provisions to support its decision that the resignation letter addressed to the Chief Minister can be construed as being addressed to the State Government. The court dismisses the writ petition and clarifies that its observations do not affect other pending proceedings.

In summary, the Karnataka High Court heard a writ petition filed by Dr. M Sudheendra Rao, the former Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, challenging the notification issued by the State Government on May 2, 2020, determining his Chairmanship by virtue of his resignation allegedly given by him. The court found that the resignation letter was indeed a resignation letter and discussed the validity and effectiveness of the letter in the eye of the law. The court concluded that the act of relinquishing the office of Chairman is unilateral and effective when communicated, without any further action required. The court also clarified that its observations do not affect other pending proceedings.
