The Union Territory of Lakshadweep has been embroiled in legal battles over the operation of resorts and commercial establishments on the islands. The High Court had directed the Lakshadweep Administration to process applications made by Seashells Beach Resort for all clearances, including finalization of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms, and to permit the resort to operate. However, the Administration argued that the resort had no license from the Tourism Department and no clearance from the Coastal Zone Regulatory Authority or the Pollution Control Board to run the resort. The Administration also alleged that the resort had violated CRZ norms and had constructed a cottage within 28 meters of the High Tide Line.

The Supreme Court directed the Administrator of the UT of Lakshadweep to furnish information on the Integrated Island Management Plan (IIMP) and CRZ for the territory. The Administrator stated that the IIMP for Agatti Island had not been finalized yet and that the CRZ Notification for the whole country, including the UT of Lakshadweep Island, had been notified by the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The Administrator also stated that the Lakshadweep Island shall be managed on the basis of an Integrated Island Management Plan to be prepared as per the guidelines given in the notification. The Administration had initiated action for giving wide publicity to the draft Integrated Island Management Plan for Agatti Island by uploading it on Lakshadweep website and will be published in two newspapers inviting comments/suggestions from the public as well as other stakeholders in the island.

In another case, nine applicants, including the respondent, applied for permission to construct buildings in Lakshadweep. Despite reminders, none of the applicants fulfilled the necessary conditions, and three of them, including the respondent, began construction without proper clearance. The Administration alleges that the respondent violated the land use diversion certificate by setting up a commercial enterprise instead of a dwelling house. The High Court allowed the respondent to run the resort, but the order was deemed legally unsustainable. The islands are of great attraction for tourists, but there has been slow progress in developing a vision plan for the area.

The lack of a vision plan for the development of islands in Lakshadweep has led to haphazard development and pressure from upmarket forces. The government has issued a notification for the preparation of Integrated Islands Management Plans (IIMPs) for each island, but the details have yet to be worked out. The court has appointed an expert committee to assist in the preparation and approval of the IIMPs, as well as to examine allegations of CRZ violations and irregularities in the establishment and running of resorts and commercial establishments on the islands. The committee will also examine whether any official of the Lakshadweep Administration has neglected their duties or committed any criminal acts. The committee will be chaired by Justice R.V. Raveendran and will include three other experts from different fields.

The court order appoints a committee to evaluate and make necessary changes to the draft Integrated Island Management Plans (IIMPs) for the Lakshadweep islands. The committee will also examine allegations of violations of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and other irregularities related to resorts and home stays on the islands. The Lakshadweep Administration will provide necessary support to the committee, and the expenses will be borne by the administration. The committee is requested to submit a preliminary report within two months.

In summary, the legal battles in Lakshadweep over the operation of resorts and commercial establishments have highlighted the lack of a vision plan for the development of the islands. The government has issued a notification for the preparation of Integrated Islands Management Plans (IIMPs) for each island, but the details have yet to be worked out. The court has appointed an expert committee to assist in the preparation and approval of the IIMPs, as well as to examine allegations of CRZ violations and irregularities in the establishment and running of resorts and commercial establishments on the islands.
