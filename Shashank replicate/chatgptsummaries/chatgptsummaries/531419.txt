The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by Amarsingh against the order of the District Judge, Jaipur City, which dismissed his objection in an execution case. The case involves a decree obtained by Seth Anantram Vijailal against Thakur Kishansingh of Patoda. After Kishansingh's death, Jagatsingh was substituted as the legal representative. Gulabchand, the successor of the decree-holder, took out execution proceedings against Amarsingh, treating him as the legal representative of the judgment-debtor. 

Amarsingh raised an objection, stating that he was not the legal representative of the deceased judgment-debtor. However, the execution court dismissed the objections, holding that the appellant was debarred from raising the objection on the principle of constructive res judicata. The court held that the principle of res judicata, as embodied in Section 11 C. P. C., and the subsidiary principles of constructive res judicata are applicable to execution proceedings. The court dismissed the appeal.

The principle of res judicata is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from re-litigating an issue that has already been decided by a court. The doctrine is based on the idea that once a court has made a final decision on an issue, that decision should be final and binding on all parties. The principle of constructive res judicata is a subsidiary principle that applies when a party has had an opportunity to raise an issue in a previous proceeding but failed to do so. In such cases, the party is deemed to have waived their right to raise the issue in a subsequent proceeding.

In this case, the court held that the principle of res judicata and the subsidiary principle of constructive res judicata applied to the execution proceedings. The court found that Amarsingh had an opportunity to raise his objection in a previous proceeding but failed to do so. As a result, the court held that he was debarred from raising the objection in the current proceeding.

The court's decision to dismiss the appeal was based on the application of these legal principles. The court found that Amarsingh's objection was barred by the principle of constructive res judicata, and therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

In addition to dismissing the appeal, the court also ordered that the parties involved would bear their own costs. This means that each party would be responsible for paying their own legal fees and expenses associated with the case.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of understanding the legal principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata. It also emphasizes the need for parties to raise all relevant objections in a timely manner to avoid being barred from raising them in future proceedings.
