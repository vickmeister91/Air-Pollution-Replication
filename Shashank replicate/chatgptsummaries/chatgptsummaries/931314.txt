In a recent court order, the issue at hand was a company's application for consent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The application was rejected due to non-compliance with certain requirements. Despite this rejection, the company continued to operate its kiln without proper consent. As a result, a notice was issued under Section 133 of the Cr.P.C.

The company challenged the maintainability of the case under Section 133, Cr.P.C. The court held that the provisions of Section 133, Cr.P.C. were not automatically repealed by the enactment of the Air Act. This means that the notice issued under Section 133 was still valid and enforceable.

However, the company had subsequently installed air pollution control equipment and was operating within prescribed limits. This meant that the proceedings under Section 133, Cr.P.C. were dropped as they had become infructuous. In other words, the company had taken steps to rectify the issue and was now operating within the legal limits.

This court order highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations. Companies must ensure that they have the necessary permits and consents before operating any equipment that may have an impact on the environment. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them.

It is also important to note that even if a company is found to be in violation of environmental regulations, they can take steps to rectify the issue. In this case, the company installed air pollution control equipment and began operating within prescribed limits. This allowed them to avoid any further legal action.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to companies that they must take their environmental responsibilities seriously. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them, which can have serious consequences for their business.
