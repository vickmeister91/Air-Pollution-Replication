In a recent court case, an appellant filed a suit for declaration of title and permanent injunction, claiming that he had constructed a house on government land with the suggestion of a Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO). However, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the SDO had given any permission or could give any permission. Additionally, the court found that the house was already in existence and it was not constructed by the plaintiff. As a result, the court dismissed the suit.

The appellant then appealed the decision, but the appeal was also dismissed. The court gave the appellant time until November 30, 2002 to deliver the possession of the suit house. If the appellant failed to do so, coercive steps would be taken.

The court's decision was based on several factors. First, the appellant was unable to provide any evidence that the SDO had given him permission to construct the house on government land. Without this permission, the appellant had no legal right to build on the land.

Second, the court found that the house was already in existence and was not constructed by the appellant. This meant that the appellant had no claim to the property and could not seek a declaration of title or permanent injunction.

Finally, the court ordered the appellant to deliver possession of the suit house by November 30, 2002. This was a clear indication that the court was not willing to tolerate any further delay or non-compliance with its orders.

Overall, this court case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when constructing a house or making any other changes to government land. Without the necessary permissions and approvals, individuals risk losing their claim to the property and facing legal consequences.
