The construction of the 'Slapper-Tattapani' road in Himachal Pradesh has been a contentious issue for some time now. The road is expected to provide better connectivity to the region and boost tourism. However, the project has been delayed due to various issues, including land acquisition and forest clearances. The court order is a step towards resolving these issues and ensuring that the project is completed in a timely manner.

The affidavit filed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Public Works) deals with four core issues related to the project. The first issue is the status of the Detailed Project Report (DPR). The court has directed the authorities to file an affidavit with regard to the status of the DPR within the mentioned period. This is an important step as the DPR is a crucial document that outlines the scope, cost, and timeline of the project.

The second issue is the status of land acquisition. The court has directed the Land Acquisition Officer to expedite the process of preparation of papers for the remaining 12 villages and complete it within four weeks. This is a significant development as land acquisition has been a major hurdle in the project. The timely completion of this process will ensure that the project can move forward without any further delays.

The third issue is the status of forest clearances. The Executive Engineer has been directed to expedite the process of collecting Non-availability Certificate and No Objection Certificate from various FRA Committees and ensure that the proposal for forest clearance is forwarded to the appropriate authorities within eight weeks. This is a crucial step as the project involves the construction of a road through a forested area. The timely clearance of the project will ensure that there is no harm to the environment and wildlife in the area.

The fourth issue is the issuance of tenders and commencement of work. While this issue has not been specifically addressed in the court order, it is expected that the timely resolution of the first three issues will pave the way for the issuance of tenders and commencement of work.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the 'Slapper-Tattapani' road project. The timely resolution of the issues related to land acquisition and forest clearances will ensure that the project can move forward without any further delays. The court's directive to file an affidavit with regard to the status of the DPR is also an important step towards ensuring that the project is completed in a timely and efficient manner. The case has been listed for further directions on 17.07.2018, and it is expected that the authorities will comply with the court's directives and ensure that the project is completed as soon as possible.
