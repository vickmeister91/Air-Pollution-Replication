The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently issued several court orders pertaining to criminal cases. In one case, a petitioner named Shri R.K. Garg challenged the summons issued against him for alleged violations of the Contract Labour (R&A) Act 1970 and Contract Labour (R&A) Central Rules, 1971. The petitioner's counsel argued that the summoning orders were legally infirm as the learned Magistrate did not follow the provisions of Section 204 of the Cr.P.C. The respondents did not contest the allegations made in the complaint.

In another case, the petitioner was accused of violating certain provisions, but the complainant did not provide the necessary prosecution sanction. The court referred to a previous case with similar circumstances and concluded that the summons issued against the petitioner should be quashed and recalled until the prosecution sanction is meted out by the designated authority. The court also noted that the learned magistrate concerned should take cognizance upon the complaint and issue orders for summoning the accused/petitioner after the apposite orders for prosecuting the petitioner are rendered by the designated authority.

In a third case, the court discussed a reference made by the Hon'ble Apex Court for an adjudication by a larger bench regarding the scope of inquiry under Section 156(3) of the CR.P.C. and whether statutory sanction is required for launching a prosecution against a public servant. The respondents argued that the court should wait for the verdict of the larger bench before applying the decision of a co-ordinate bench. However, the court found that the submission was founded on a misreading of the verdict and a lack of awareness of the provisions of Section 204 of the CR.P.C. The court explained the provisions of Section 156(3) and the statutory obligation of the Magistrate to order investigations and lodge an FIR. The court also highlighted the contradistinctivities between the statutorily ordained manner of complaint and the issuance of summons upon the accused.

In the fourth case, the court discussed the process of taking cognizance in a criminal case and the requirement of obtaining statutory sanction before prosecuting a public servant. The court quashed the summoning order and allowed the complaint to be filed again after the appropriate sanction is obtained. The court also considered the petitioner's request to have their name deleted and replaced with another person. All pending applications were disposed of.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper legal procedures and obtaining necessary sanctions before prosecuting individuals, particularly public servants. The court also emphasized the role of the Magistrate in ordering investigations and issuing summonses in accordance with the law.
