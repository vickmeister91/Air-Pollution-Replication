The Adarsh Brick Kiln Industry had challenged an order to change the site of their brick kiln due to pollution complaints. The order was passed by the Principal Secretary, U.P. Pollution Control Board and the Appellate Authority. The petitioner had previously been directed to close the brick kiln and relocate it after applying for a no objection certificate. The petitioner appealed the decision and was allowed to operate the brick kiln until 30.6.2002, after which they were required to relocate. 

The petitioner did not challenge the appellate order but made a fresh application for inspection. The inspection found that the brick kiln was non-polluting, but the regional officer refused to grant a no objection certificate. The petitioner then filed a writ petition in the court, challenging the refusal to grant the no objection certificate.

The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the order of the Appellate Authority had become final and the petitioner had taken benefit under the same by operating the brick kiln until 30.6.2002. The court held that the petitioner could not challenge the order of the Appellate Authority by filing a fresh application for inspection. The court also held that the regional officer had the power to refuse to grant a no objection certificate, even if the inspection report found that the brick kiln was non-polluting.

The court observed that the petitioner had not challenged the appellate order within the prescribed time limit and had taken benefit under the same by operating the brick kiln until 30.6.2002. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to challenge the order of the Appellate Authority at this stage. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to relocate the brick kiln, as directed by the Appellate Authority.
