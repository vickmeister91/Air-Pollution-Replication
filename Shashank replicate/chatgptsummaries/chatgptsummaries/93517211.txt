In a recent court order, it was decided that the case between Santosh Bhai and the State of Madhya Pradesh will be transferred to the National Green Tribunal in Bhopal. The decision was made as the matter falls under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010. The petitioner's counsel did not oppose this decision.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act. The tribunal is responsible for handling cases related to environmental issues and disputes. The NGT has the power to hear cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, including the right to clean air, water, and soil.

In the case between Santosh Bhai and the State of Madhya Pradesh, it is not clear what the specific environmental issue is that led to the transfer of the case to the NGT. However, it is likely that the case involves some sort of environmental violation or dispute.

The decision to transfer the case to the NGT is significant because it means that the case will now be heard by a specialized environmental tribunal. This is important because environmental issues can be complex and require specialized knowledge and expertise to properly address.

The NGT has a number of powers and functions that make it well-suited to handle environmental cases. For example, the tribunal has the power to issue orders and directions to any person, authority, or government agency to take steps to prevent or mitigate environmental damage. The NGT can also impose penalties and fines on those who violate environmental laws.

In addition to its adjudicatory functions, the NGT also has a number of other responsibilities related to environmental protection. For example, the tribunal is responsible for monitoring the implementation of environmental laws and policies, and for promoting environmental education and awareness.

Overall, the decision to transfer the case between Santosh Bhai and the State of Madhya Pradesh to the NGT is a positive development for environmental protection in India. By ensuring that environmental cases are heard by a specialized tribunal with the necessary expertise and powers, the NGT can help to ensure that environmental laws are properly enforced and that environmental damage is minimized.
