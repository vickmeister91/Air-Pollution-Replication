The court orders discussed in this article pertain to cases involving stone crushers in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. In the first case, the owners of stone crushers challenged two orders passed by the Board, claiming that they had been running their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners had filed writ petitions before the High Court, which had allowed the petitions and remitted the matter to the Board for deciding afresh. However, the Board had refused to grant consent under Section 21 of the Act to the petitioners and directed them to close their units. The petitioners had again approached the High Court, which heard the preliminary objection raised by the Board's counsel regarding the maintainability of the petitions.

The court order discusses the powers of the Board to inspect and give directions for the prevention, control, or abatement of air pollution. Section 21 of the Act requires the Board's consent for establishing or operating any industrial plant in the air pollution control area. The Board can grant, refuse, or cancel consent by passing an appropriate order. Section 31 of the Act grants the right to file an appeal against an order made by the State Board under this Act. The court also discusses the distinction between an order and a direction and the circumstances under which an alternate remedy does not bar a person from invoking the writ jurisdiction of a High Court. The court then examines the contentions raised by both parties regarding the impugned orders passed under Section 21 and Section 31A of the Act. The petitioners contend that the orders suffer from non-application of mind, violation of principles of natural justice, and violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Board argues that it was justified in relying on earlier notices and replies and had given the petitioners an opportunity of oral hearing. The court ultimately finds the preliminary objection unacceptable and upholds the writ petitions.

In the second case, the court discusses a case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued a notice to the stone crusher unit for not following pollution control measures and causing health hazards. The court found that the notice was vague and did not give the unit a clear understanding of the case against them. The Board did not follow the proper procedure for granting or renewing consent to operate, and the order to close the unit was legally unsustainable. The court also emphasized the importance of giving a clear and specific notice and an opportunity to be heard before taking any action against a unit.

In the third case, the court discusses the State Board's power to refuse consent to industries that do not comply with pollution control measures. The court found that the Board had violated the principles of natural justice and the fundamental rights of the petitioner, M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher, by not providing relevant documents and not conducting a re-inspection before passing the impugned order. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the applications filed by the petitioners for renewal of the consent order within four months. The court also directed the Board to inspect the sites and collect air samples during the period in which the stone crushers operate their units. The State Government was directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

In the fourth case, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of the Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article pertain to cases involving stone crushers in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The court has emphasized the importance of following proper procedures for granting or renewing consent to operate and giving clear and specific notices and an opportunity to be heard before taking any action against a unit. The court has also ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones and directed the Board to inspect the sites and collect air samples during the period in which the stone crushers operate their units.
