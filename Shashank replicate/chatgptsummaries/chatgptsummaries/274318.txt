The Civil Liberties and Human Rights Organisation (CLAHRO) filed a petition on behalf of the family of Ningthoujam Angou Singh, who died while in police custody. The court found that his death had been established and ordered the State of Manipur to pay a compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- to his wife and minor children within three months. The court also allowed the State Government to recover this amount from those responsible for causing his death.

The case of Ningthoujam Angou Singh is a tragic example of the abuse of power by law enforcement officials. Singh was arrested by the police on suspicion of theft and was taken into custody. However, he died while in police custody, and his family alleged that he had been tortured to death. The family filed a petition with the court seeking justice for their loved one.

The court heard the case and found that Singh's death had been established. The court also found that the police had violated Singh's human rights by subjecting him to torture while in custody. The court ordered the State of Manipur to pay a compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- to Singh's wife and minor children within three months.

The court's decision to order compensation for Singh's family is a step towards justice for the victim and his family. The compensation will provide some financial relief to the family, who have suffered a great loss. However, the compensation alone is not enough to address the issue of police brutality and abuse of power.

The court also allowed the State Government to recover the compensation amount from those responsible for causing Singh's death. This is an important step towards holding law enforcement officials accountable for their actions. It sends a message that the State will not tolerate abuse of power by law enforcement officials and that those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.

The court's decision in this case is a positive development in the fight against police brutality and abuse of power. It is important that law enforcement officials are held accountable for their actions and that victims of police brutality receive justice. The court's decision to order compensation for Singh's family and to allow the State Government to recover the compensation amount from those responsible for causing his death is a step towards achieving this goal.
