In a recent court order, the petitioner, Suresh Chand, filed a petition to quash an FIR against him for alleged offenses under section 420 I.P.C. and the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court refused to quash the FIR as a prima facie cognizable offense was made out.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the FIR was false or malicious.

Despite this, the court did provide some relief to the petitioner. The court directed that if the petitioner appears before the court concerned within 30 days and applies for bail, the same shall be considered and disposed of expeditiously.

This means that the petitioner still has the opportunity to seek bail and defend himself against the allegations made in the FIR. The court's decision to consider and dispose of the bail application expeditiously is also a positive development for the petitioner, as it ensures that he will not be kept in custody for an extended period of time.

Overall, while the court's decision to refuse to quash the FIR may be disappointing for the petitioner, the court's direction to consider and dispose of the bail application expeditiously provides some relief and ensures that the petitioner's rights are protected.
