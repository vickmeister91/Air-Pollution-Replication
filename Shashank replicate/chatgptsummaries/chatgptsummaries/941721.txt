The court order pertains to a case where a petitioner challenged the appointment of a less qualified candidate to the post of Senior Environmental Scientist by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The petitioner argued that he was more qualified and eligible for the post. The court found that the diploma in AIC obtained by the appointed candidate was not equivalent to the required M.Sc. degree in Chemistry and that the selection process was flawed. The court directed the Board to reconsider the appointment and make a decision based on merit and qualifications.

The case was later appealed to the Supreme Court, which directed the High Court to examine the matter afresh and pass a fresh order in accordance with the law. The court order sets aside the appointment of the second respondent as Senior Environmental Scientist and maintains the status quo until the High Court decides the matter. The High Court will make a final decision as quickly as possible. The appeals are dismissed, and the order of the learned single Judge is confirmed.

The court also declares that any appointment made contrary to the qualifications prescribed in the advertisement or the Recruitment Rules by the authorities instrumentalities of the State shall not be appreciated as it amounts to playing fraud on the public. The court also deals with another writ petition filed by Mr. N.B. Ramesh seeking a writ of Mandamus declaring the action of the respondents in not considering the Associateship Diploma in Institution of Chemists (India) obtained by Examination on par with M.Sc. (Chemistry) for recruitment and promotion of various posts for which M.Sc. (Chemistry) is prescribed as a requisite qualification as arbitrary, illegal and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
