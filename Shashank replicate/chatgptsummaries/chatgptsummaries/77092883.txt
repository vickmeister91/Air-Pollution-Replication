The Rajasthan High Court has received multiple writ petitions in the public interest regarding the Jal Mahal Tourism Project and the Mansagar Lake Precinct Lease Agreement. The petitions request the cancellation of the project and the lease agreement, the removal of encroachments made in the catchment area of Mansagar Lake, and the cessation of sewage discharge into the lake. The court has been asked to direct the respondents to monitor and maintain the lake and to take appropriate action against those responsible for the transfer of land in favour of the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation and Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. The court has reserved its order.

One of the court orders prohibits the flushing out of salts from Mansagar Lake, as it will convert the fresh water lake into a saline lake and harm its flora and fauna. The petitioner argues that the construction of a storm water management plan in the lake bed without proper sanction and study has increased the chloride content and salinity of the water, affecting biodiversity and bird species. The petitioner also alleges illegal actions, including non-clearance of the tourism project by the MOEF, violation of public trust doctrine, and fraudulent siphoning of public property. The court order raises concerns about the project's impact on the environment, wildlife, and historical significance of the area, and questions the validity of the lease agreement and the private sector developer's qualifications and experience.

Another court order discusses a dispute over the leasing of land for the Jal Mahal Tourism Project in Jaipur, India. The court finds that the lease agreement is not beneficial to the lessor and that the construction of a hotel in the area is not permissible. The court also notes that the revised plan for the project violates open public space requirements and that the area should not have been leased out to a private person due to the presence of religious sites. The court considers the arguments of the state government, the Jaipur Development Authority, and the lessee, Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd., and KGK Consortium. The lessee argues that the project is in the public interest and that they have invested significant funds in restoring the Mansagar Lake and Jal Mahal monument. The court ultimately rules in favor of the petitioners and orders the cancellation of the lease agreement.

The court order discusses the legality of a project to restore the Jal Mahal monument and Mansagar Lake in Jaipur, India. The court finds that the project has been approved by the appropriate authorities, including the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and that the restoration work has substantially improved the lake's water quality. The court also addresses concerns about the lease of 100 acres of land to a private company for commercial development, finding that the lease is legal and that the company has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. The court rejects arguments that the project violates environmental regulations or the principles of public trust.

The court order pertains to the leasing of a 100-acre area of Mansagar Lake to Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. for a period of 99 years. The court found that the lease did not violate any previous court orders and that the lease rent was Rs. 2.52 crores per annum with an escalation of 10% every three years. The court also noted that the lake and the Jal Mahal monument were of historical and international importance and had undergone several rounds of restoration under various rulers of Rajasthan. The court found that the project had been conceptualized in 1999 and had been approved by the MOEF and the SCID. The court also noted that the leaseholder had volunteered to restore the Jal Mahal monument at their own cost. The court found that the leaseholder was entitled to be in peaceful possession and use of the demised premises and that the lessor was bound to complete the restoration of the lake as per the Mansagar Lake Management Plan and maintain the lake. The court also noted that certain commercial/tourism functions had been permitted in the project area.

The court order pertains to a project on the Mansagar Lake in Jaipur, which includes the development of a resort, craft village, restaurant, food court, entertainment center, multiplex, and amusement park, among other facilities. The court considers the impact of the project on the ecology of the area and cites the public trust doctrine, which requires the government to protect natural resources for the benefit of the public and not permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court also notes that the leave and license agreement for the project is for commercial gain, given at a nominal fee of Rs.1 per annum for 99 years. The court emphasizes the obligation to use natural resources in a manner that does not impair or diminish the people's rights and long-term interest in the property or resource.

The court order discusses the public trust doctrine, which states that the state is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment and has a legal duty to protect them. The doctrine includes the responsibility of the government to protect and preserve the environment and natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the principle of inter-generational equity in protecting natural resources. The order cites several cases where the court has ordered the restoration of communal property and the removal of illegal constructions on public land.

The court has ordered that a pond cannot be allotted for construction or any other purpose. The respondents who illegally occupied the land must vacate it and the material of the house must be taken away. The court
