The Chhattisgarh High Court recently granted bail to six individuals who were accused of hunting a scheduled wild animal. The court order pertains to a bail application filed by the accused, who had been in detention since March 9, 2016. The court allowed the bail application, considering the nature and gravity of the offense, the fact that the applicants were in detention for a considerable period, and substantial investigation had already been completed.

The accused were charged under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, for hunting a scheduled wild animal. The act prohibits hunting, killing, or capturing any wild animal listed in Schedule I to IV of the act. The accused were alleged to have hunted a wild animal listed in Schedule II of the act, which carries a maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000.

The court also imposed certain conditions on the accused, such as not leaving the jurisdiction of the trial court without prior permission, cooperating with the investigation, and attending the trial court on all dates.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. The accused had been in detention for a considerable period, and substantial investigation had already been completed.
