The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by T Lingerajegowda seeking the renewal of a quarrying lease. The court quashed and set aside two communications issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forests and directed an enquiry to be conducted to determine whether the leased area or any part thereof is a forest or forest area. 

The petitioner had filed the writ petition seeking the renewal of a quarrying lease that had expired in 2015. The petitioner had also sought a direction to the authorities to permit him to continue quarrying operations until the renewal of the lease was granted. The petitioner had further sought a direction to the authorities to permit him to transport the extracted material from the quarry.

The court, in its order, observed that the petitioner had been carrying out quarrying operations in the leased area for several years and had been paying the necessary fees and royalties to the authorities. The court noted that the petitioner had applied for the renewal of the lease well in advance of its expiry and that the authorities had not taken any decision on the application for renewal of the lease.

The court further observed that the authorities had issued two communications stating that the leased area was a forest or forest area and that quarrying operations could not be carried out in the area. The court noted that the petitioner had challenged the communications on the ground that they were issued without any enquiry or investigation into the nature of the leased area.

The court, after considering the submissions made by the parties, quashed and set aside the two communications issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forests. The court directed an enquiry to be conducted to determine whether the leased area or any part thereof is a forest or forest area. The court directed the Deputy Conservator of Forests to submit a report on the enquiry within a period of three months from the date of the order.

The court further directed the State Government to take an appropriate decision on the application for renewal of quarrying lease made by the petitioner within one month from the date on which the report is submitted by the Deputy Conservator of Forests. The court clarified that the decision taken by the State Government would be subject to the outcome of the enquiry conducted by the Deputy Conservator of Forests.

The court, however, did not make any adjudication on the other prayers made in the petition. The court did not grant the petitioner's prayer for permission to continue quarrying operations until the renewal of the lease was granted. The court also did not grant the petitioner's prayer for permission to transport the extracted material from the quarry.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Karnataka High Court in the writ petition filed by T Lingerajegowda seeking the renewal of a quarrying lease is significant as it quashed and set aside two communications issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forests and directed an enquiry to be conducted to determine whether the leased area or any part thereof is a forest or forest area. The court also directed the State Government to take an appropriate decision on the application for renewal of quarrying lease made by the petitioner within one month from the date on which the report is submitted by the Deputy Conservator of Forests. The court, however, did not make any adjudication on the other prayers made in the petition.
