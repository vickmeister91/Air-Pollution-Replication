The court order pertains to a revision petition filed by Anil Garg challenging the rejection of his application under Section 91 Cr.PC seeking direction to the investigating officer to produce the statement of witnesses. The FIR was registered against the petitioner, his son, and wife on the statement of Monika Garg, wife of late Ved Garg, under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to the provision of Section 91 Cr.PC.

The court dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner has every right to call the statement of witnesses during his defense to prove his innocence. The court directed that the statement of witnesses collected during the investigation be produced at the time of framing of charge. The court order states that if a document or thing is believed to be necessary for an investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding, a court or officer may issue a summons or written order to the person in possession of it to attend and produce it. If the person is only required to produce the document or thing, they can comply by causing it to be produced instead of attending personally.

The court must balance the interests of the individual and society when deciding whether to grant an application for summoning evidence. The petitioner in this case has the right to access all evidence collected by the investigating agency during the investigation, and the prosecution cannot withhold evidence that the accused claims is in their favor.
