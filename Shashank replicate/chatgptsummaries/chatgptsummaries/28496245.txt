The State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials have been the subject of multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court order lists the details of the petitions and the parties involved. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court examined the facts of the case and the relevant policies and regulations before making its decision.

One of the petitions pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking relief from the demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The court considered the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land diversion.

Another petition discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of Net Present Value (NPV) shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected.

The court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for extended period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court heard arguments from the Additional Advocate General and noted that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and approval was given for the entire area valid up to 28.10.2017. The court also noted that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court ultimately found that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wished that the proposal should be extended.

The court order pertains to a forest land proposal for a cluster area of 281 hectares. The mining lease holders had refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department.
