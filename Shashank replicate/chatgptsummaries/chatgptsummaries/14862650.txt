The court order pertains to two separate criminal appeals related to the possession and dealing of products derived from an endangered species, Tibetan Antelope, also known as Shahtoosh. The first appeal was filed by Manzoor Ahmed, who had been convicted of possessing seven Shahtoosh shawls and sentenced to two years of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh. The second appeal was related to the illegal raid and recovery of items from the accused, who was found guilty of dealing in products derived from an endangered species without a valid license or permit and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 1 lakh rupees.

In the first appeal, the court rejected the appellant's plea to lead additional evidence in his defense and dismissed his appeal. The court also held that the testimony of wildlife officials was admissible and that non-compliance with Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not render the raid and recovery illegal. This means that the prosecution's case against Manzoor Ahmed was upheld, and he was found guilty of possessing Shahtoosh shawls, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act.

In the second appeal, the court noted that the raid and recovery of items were illegal due to non-compliance with Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, this did not affect the prosecution's case as the accused admitted to the raid and recovery of items. The accused was found guilty of dealing in products derived from an endangered species without a valid license or permit and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 1 lakh rupees. The plea for probation of good conduct was denied.

The court also noted that the minimum sentence for such offenses was increased from one year to three years by an amendment in 2003, but the pre-amended provisions apply in this case as the offense was committed in 2000. This means that the accused in the second appeal received a lesser sentence than what would have been applicable under the amended provisions.

The court's decision in both appeals highlights the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating the Wildlife Protection Act. The possession and dealing of products derived from endangered species are serious offenses that can result in imprisonment and fines. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for compliance with legal procedures during raids and recoveries to ensure that evidence is admissible in court.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two criminal appeals related to the possession and dealing of products derived from an endangered species, Tibetan Antelope. The court upheld the prosecution's case in both appeals and sentenced the accused to imprisonment and fines. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of protecting endangered species and complying with legal procedures during raids and recoveries.
