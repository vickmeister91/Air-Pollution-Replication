The case at hand involves a dispute over land that is part of the Bannerghatta National Park. The petitioner, Sri Chikkanna, had been occupying the land in question and had been directed to vacate it. The final report was filed against him, and the court found no grounds to quash the proceedings.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies that the petitioner's claim of perfecting his title by adverse possession cannot be decided at this stage.

However, the court has made it clear that this claim cannot be decided at this stage of the proceedings.
