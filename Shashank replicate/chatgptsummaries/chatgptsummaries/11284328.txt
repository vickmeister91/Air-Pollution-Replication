Dr. Shabir Hussain Banday, a former employee of the University of Kashmir, appealed a court order that rejected his prayer for quashing an order passed by the University that terminated his service without holding any enquiry. The court examined whether holding a regular departmental enquiry was mandatory when the facts had been admitted and whether the useless formality theory would be applicable. The court also considered whether Statute 3.27 (13) of the University of Kashmir would be applicable. The court found that the petitioner had abandoned his post and upheld the termination of his services.

The case revolved around the termination of Dr. Shabir Hussain Banday's services by the University of Kashmir without holding any enquiry. Dr. Banday appealed the decision, arguing that the University had violated the principles of natural justice by not holding an enquiry before terminating his services. The court examined whether holding a regular departmental enquiry was mandatory when the facts had been admitted and whether the useless formality theory would be applicable.

The court observed that the facts of the case were not in dispute, and Dr. Banday had admitted to abandoning his post. The court noted that the University had the power to terminate the services of an employee who had abandoned their post without notice. The court also observed that the University had the power to refuse or revoke leave if the services of a teacher were required. If a teacher failed to return to their duties after their leave had expired without obtaining further leave, they would be deemed to have vacated their post without notice.

The court examined whether Statute 3.27 (13) of the University of Kashmir would be applicable. The statute provided that if a teacher was absent from duty for more than 15 days without prior permission, their services would be terminated without notice. The court observed that Dr. Banday had been absent from duty for more than 15 days without prior permission, and therefore, the statute would be applicable.

The court also considered whether the useless formality theory would be applicable. The theory was an exception to the general rule of issuance of show cause notice. The theory provided that if the facts of the case were not in dispute, and the employee had admitted to the charges, holding a departmental enquiry would be a useless formality. The court noted that a similar case had been decided by the court earlier, where the useless formality theory had been applied. The court found that the useless formality theory would apply to this case as well, and therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

In conclusion, the court upheld the termination of Dr. Shabir Hussain Banday's services by the University of Kashmir. The court found that the petitioner had abandoned his post, and the useless formality theory would apply to the case. The court observed that the University had the power to terminate the services of an employee who had abandoned their post without notice. The court also noted that the University had the power to refuse or revoke leave if the services of a teacher were required. If a teacher failed to return to their duties after their leave had expired without obtaining further leave, they would be deemed to have vacated their post without notice.
