The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in response to two writ petitions filed by Oothumalai Makkal Nila Urimai Koottamaippu and S. Muthukrishnan against the State of Tamil Nadu and various government officials. The petitioners sought possession of land assigned to them for agricultural use, which was classified as assessed waste dry land. However, the land was later notified under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act and assigned to the Forest Department for social forestry plantation.

The court rejected the petitioners' request for possession of the land, citing the fact that the land had been legally assigned to the Forest Department for social forestry plantation. However, the court did direct the officials to consider alternative land for agricultural use for the landless agriculturists.

The court's decision was based on a number of factors. First, the court noted that the land in question had been legally assigned to the Forest Department for social forestry plantation. This assignment was made under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, which allows the government to declare any land as a reserved forest or a protected forest. Once land is declared as a reserved forest or a protected forest, it is no longer available for any other use.

Second, the court noted that the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the land had been assigned to them for agricultural use. The court found that the petitioners had not produced any documents to show that they had been granted possession of the land for agricultural use, nor had they produced any evidence to show that they had been cultivating the land.

Third, the court noted that the Forest Department had already invested significant resources in developing the land for social forestry plantation. The court found that the Forest Department had planted trees on the land and had taken other steps to develop the land for social forestry plantation. The court noted that allowing the petitioners to take possession of the land would result in the destruction of the Forest Department's investment in the land.

Despite rejecting the petitioners' request for possession of the land, the court did direct the officials to consider alternative land for agricultural use for the landless agriculturists. The court noted that the government had a duty to provide land to landless agriculturists for agricultural use, and that this duty could not be ignored. The court directed the officials to identify suitable land for agricultural use and to make it available to the landless agriculturists.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's recent court order in response to two writ petitions filed by Oothumalai Makkal Nila Urimai Koottamaippu and S. Muthukrishnan against the State of Tamil Nadu and various government officials rejected the petitioners' request for possession of land assigned to them for agricultural use, which was classified as assessed waste dry land. However, the court did direct the officials to consider alternative land for agricultural use for the landless agriculturists. The court's decision was based on a number of factors, including the fact that the land had been legally assigned to the Forest Department for social forestry plantation, the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the land had been assigned to them for agricultural use, and the Forest Department had already invested significant resources in developing the land for social forestry plantation.
