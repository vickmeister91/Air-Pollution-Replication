The court order in question pertains to a case where the plaintiff filed a suit for declaration and partition, claiming that a sale deed executed on their behalf by their father was not binding and that they were entitled to a 1/5 share of the property. The trial court declared the sale deed void and passed a decree in favor of the plaintiff. However, the defendant appealed the decision, arguing that the suit was barred by limitation and that the sale deed was executed for valid consideration. 

The appellate court confirmed the trial court's decision, but the defendant appealed again. The High Court ultimately ruled that the suit was indeed barred by limitation and dismissed it, setting aside the previous judgments and decree.
