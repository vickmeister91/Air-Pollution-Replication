The case in question involves a plaintiff who filed a suit against two defendants for the recovery of money based on oral loans. The second defendant did not appear on the first hearing and was declared ex parte. Later, he filed an application under Order 9, Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the ex parte order, which was allowed. The trial court passed a decree against the second defendant and dismissed the suit against the first defendant. 

The second defendant appealed this decision, and the lower appellate court remanded the suit, stating that the evidence recorded before the second defendant entered appearance could not be used against him. The plaintiff appealed this decision, and the court held that the second defendant was entitled to take part in the trial at a later stage and that if he desired to cross-examine the witnesses examined before he entered appearance, he could apply under Rule 7 and get an order. 

The court further stated that as the second defendant did not choose to avail himself of the right to cross-examine these witnesses, the lower appellate court was not justified in remanding the suit. The court set aside the order of remand and sent the case back to the lower appellate court for disposal according to law.

The case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and the consequences of not doing so. The second defendant's failure to appear in court initially resulted in an ex parte order being passed against him. However, he was able to set aside this order by filing an application under Order 9, Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 

The lower appellate court's decision to remand the suit was based on the belief that evidence recorded before the second defendant entered appearance could not be used against him. However, the higher court held that the second defendant was entitled to take part in the trial at a later stage and could cross-examine witnesses examined before he entered appearance by applying under Rule 7. 

The court's decision to set aside the order of remand and send the case back to the lower appellate court for disposal according to law emphasizes the importance of following proper legal procedures and the consequences of not doing so. It also highlights the need for defendants to be aware of their rights and to take advantage of them when necessary. 

In conclusion, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures and the consequences of not doing so.
