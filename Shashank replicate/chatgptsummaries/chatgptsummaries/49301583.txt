The Mvp Social Workers Association filed a writ petition as a Public Interest Litigation against the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority for allowing the construction of an electronic and video games complex near VUDA Park at Visakhapatnam beach line. The petitioner argued that this construction violates the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the rules made thereunder. The petitioner sought a mandamus to declare the construction illegal and to direct the respondents not to proceed with any type of construction within the area of 200 metres from the High Tide Line near VUDA park.

The court examined the deed of licence between the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority and the licensee, MGM Diamond Beach Resorts Private Limited, and found that the licence had conditions to safeguard the environment and prevent the construction of permanent structures. The court found no violation of the terms and conditions of the licence. The court order states that the 4th respondent must invest a minimum of Rs. 5.00 crores in a project and adhere to the progress and investment stipulated in the license agreement. The licensee must also pay a penalty for any shortfall in investment.

The court found that there was no violation of the license agreement or notification issued under the Act and rules made thereunder. The 4th respondent was not authorized to carry out any prohibited activities, and the court found that none of these activities had been undertaken. The court also found that the necessary precautionary measures had been taken to protect the sensitive area in question before granting the license.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the license agreement between the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority and MGM Diamond Beach Resorts Private Limited had conditions to safeguard the environment and prevent the construction of permanent structures.
