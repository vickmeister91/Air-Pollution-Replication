Faruk Qureshi, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, filed a petition for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) as he was under apprehension of arrest in connection with a forest crime. The allegation against him was that he was involved in illegal hunting, business, and collection of tiger bones. The trial court observed that he was absconding and dismissed the application for bail.

The case against Faruk Qureshi was related to the illegal hunting and trade of tiger bones, which is a serious offense under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including tigers, and also prohibits the trade of any part or product derived from them. The act provides for strict penalties, including imprisonment and fines, for those found guilty of violating its provisions.

The case against Faruk Qureshi was based on a complaint filed by the forest department, which alleged that he was involved in the illegal hunting and trade of tiger bones. The complaint stated that he was part of a larger network of poachers and traders who were involved in the illegal trade of tiger bones and other wildlife products. The forest department had conducted raids at various locations and had seized a large quantity of tiger bones and other wildlife products.

Faruk Qureshi, who was named as an accused in the case, had gone into hiding after the raids. He had approached the trial court seeking anticipatory bail, which is a provision under the Cr.P.C. that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect a person from arrest in cases where there is a likelihood of false or frivolous charges being leveled against them.

However, the trial court observed that Faruk Qureshi was absconding and dismissed his application for anticipatory bail. The court noted that he had not cooperated with the investigation and had gone into hiding to evade arrest. The court also observed that the allegations against him were serious and that there was a prima facie case against him.

The dismissal of Faruk Qureshi's application for anticipatory bail meant that he could be arrested by the police at any time. The forest department, which was investigating the case, had already arrested several other accused in the case and was actively pursuing the remaining accused.

The case against Faruk Qureshi highlights the serious issue of illegal wildlife trade in India. Despite the strict provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, the trade in wildlife products continues to thrive due to the high demand for these products in international markets. The illegal trade in tiger bones, in particular, is a major concern as it threatens the survival of the already endangered species.

The government and law enforcement agencies need to take strong measures to curb the illegal wildlife trade and ensure that those involved in such activities are brought to justice. The public also needs to be made aware of the importance of protecting wildlife and the consequences of engaging in illegal activities related to wildlife.

In conclusion, the dismissal of Faruk Qureshi's application for anticipatory bail in connection with a forest crime related to the illegal hunting and trade of tiger bones highlights the serious issue of illegal wildlife trade in India. The case underscores the need for strong measures to curb the illegal trade in wildlife products and ensure that those involved in such activities are brought to justice. The public also needs to be made aware of the importance of protecting wildlife and the consequences of engaging in illegal activities related to wildlife.
