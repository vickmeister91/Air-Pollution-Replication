In January 2017, an oil spill caused by the collision of two ships near Ennore Port, Chennai, resulted in the death of many turtles and fishes and stopped the fishermen in the region from venturing out in the sea. The lack of basic and rudimentary facilities to pump out oil spill and the haphazard measures taken by the Indian authorities were criticized by the petitioner, M.E. Raja, who filed a writ petition for a writ of mandamus. The petition directed the Principal Secretary to the Government, Environment and Forest Department, Chennai, and the Director of Fisheries, Chennai, to grant compensation to the fishermen from three districts affected by the oil spill without insisting for membership from fishermen societies. The respondents were directed to take cognizance of the accident in pursuance of the clear dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Vellore Citizen's Welfare Forum's case on the principle of "polluter pays".

In response to the writ petition, the court ordered the state government to take urgent steps to address the situation and investigate the matter. The court also raised concerns about the release of one of the vessels involved in the incident and the distribution of compensation to affected fishermen. The authorities were directed to complete the investigation and compensation process as soon as possible.

The court noted that there was a lack of transparency in awarding compensation to fishermen affected by a maritime disaster. The list of eligible fishermen had not been published, and there was no public hearing or opinion gathering process. Membership to fishermen societies had been stopped for eight years, which meant that many fishermen were not members and therefore not eligible for compensation. The court ordered a deposit of Rs. 141 crores towards the claims of the fishermen and their associations, and a bank guarantee of Rs. 84 crores to be arranged for the remaining claims. The court also ordered compliance with certain conditions before the return of a bank guarantee and the permission for a vessel to sail out.

The court ordered the Dawn Kanchipuram ship to sail from Kamarajar Port Ltd., Ennore, and directed the Fisheries Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, to entertain, appraise, and disburse the claims of fishermen affected by the oil spill. The government would do so upon the deposit of Rs.141 Crores. A committee was formed to suggest suitable ways to calculate the compensation amount to be given to different categories of fisherfolk affected by the oil spill. The National Green Tribunal (South Zone), Chennai, was not functioning, and the Department of Fisheries was directed to permit the Meenava Thanthai K.R.Selvarajkumar, Meenavar Nala Sangam Association to put forth their claim for compensation. The Department of Fisheries was to arrive at a final amount of compensation to be paid after conducting proper inquiry and finalizing the list of persons who were affected. Any person who was affected was to make their application within two weeks from the date of the order.

In another court order, the court discussed the progress of a compensation process for a fishing accident, with over 100,000 applications pending. The Department of Fisheries was directed to nominate officers to scrutinize and finalize claims, with a report due by the next hearing. The court also directed the state government to consider interim compensation payments for undisputed claims. The order also addressed the investigation into the accident and directed the submission of a report on the investigation's progress. Failure to comply with the court's orders may result in imprisonment or fines. The petitioner's representation had not been considered, and they had approached the court for relief.

The court order stated that the petitioner had approached the court for a writ of mandamus as the National Green Tribunal (South Zone) had not considered their order. The court noted that non-disbursement of compensation had been brought to their attention, and Rs.141 crores had been deposited with the government by the insurers of the ships involved. The court also noted that a large number of fishermen were affected. The court entertained a suo motu Public Interest Litigation and impleaded the Director of Fisheries, Chennai, as the ninth respondent to disburse compensation to eligible persons. The court directed the scrutiny and approval of the report and the completion of the de-duplication process. The court ordered the disbursement of due compensation to eligible persons within four weeks from the date of the order. The court dismissed the writ petition and the connected Miscellaneous Petition without costs. The status report filed by the Additional Director of Fisheries, Marine, Chennai, was also mentioned in the court order.

The Government of Tamil Nadu was ordered to pay Rs.203.225 crores in compensation to 1,12,051 affected fishermen. The state government had already provided Rs.15 crore to 30,000 affected fishermen families and received Rs.97,95,682 from shipping companies under Corporate Social Responsibility Fund. The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal directed the Department to permit affected persons to make their claim until 10/8/2017, and a revised claim of Rs.240 crore had been submitted. An amount of Rs.141 crores had been received from steamship, and an irrevocable B.G worth 84 crore had been obtained from the Shipping Company. A Relief Recommendation Committee had been formed to suggest suitable ways to calculate the compensation amount to different categories of fisherfolk affected by the oil spill. Seven categories had been recommended to receive compensation.
