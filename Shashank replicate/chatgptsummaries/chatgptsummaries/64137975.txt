The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by M/s. Sri Murugan Dyeing against the order of the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control, which dismissed their application for consent to operate a dyeing unit and discharge trade effluent. The appellant unit had submitted revised applications for consent, but the Board refused to grant it due to the unit's location within 1 km of the Noyyal River and in a mixed residential zone. The appellant unit had also become a member of the Kasipalayam Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), but the CETP did not have consent from the Board. The Tribunal heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the appeal.

The court order discusses the appellant's attempts to obtain consent from the Board for their dyeing unit. The unit is located within 1 km of the Noyyal River, which is prohibited by government orders. The appellant applied to shift the unit to a new location, but this was also within the prohibited distance. The Board rejected the application, and the appellant appealed to the Appellate Authority and the Tribunal. The Tribunal upheld the rejection, stating that the appellant had not received any relaxation of the government orders and had not convinced the Board with reference to any factual issue or point of law.

In another case, the appellant's application for consent to the respondent Board was rejected due to the new location being in a mixed residential zone and within 300m of the Noyyal River. The appellant appealed to the Appellate Authority and then to the NGT, arguing that the unit was an existing one and therefore the distance criteria did not apply. However, the Tribunal found that the unit had never been granted consent to operate and therefore could not be considered an existing unit. The appeals were dismissed.

These court orders highlight the importance of obtaining consent from the appropriate authorities before operating any industrial unit. The government has issued orders prohibiting the location of industrial units within a certain distance from rivers and residential areas to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The authorities have the power to reject applications for consent if they do not meet the necessary criteria, and appeals to higher authorities may not be successful if the government orders have not been relaxed or if the unit has not been granted consent to operate in the first place.

In the first case, the appellant had become a member of the CETP, which is a common facility for treating effluent from multiple units. However, the CETP did not have consent from the Board, which meant that the appellant's effluent was not being treated properly. This highlights the importance of ensuring that common facilities have the necessary approvals before becoming a member.

In the second case, the appellant argued that the unit was an existing one and therefore the distance criteria did not apply. However, the Tribunal found that the unit had never been granted consent to operate, which meant that it was not an existing unit. This highlights the importance of obtaining consent before operating any industrial unit and not assuming that it is an existing unit just because it has been in operation for some time.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the need for industrial units to comply with government orders and obtain necessary approvals before operating. Failure to do so can result in rejection of applications for consent and appeals to higher authorities may not be successful if the necessary criteria have not been met. It is important for industrial units to be aware of the regulations and take necessary steps to comply with them to protect the environment and prevent pollution.
