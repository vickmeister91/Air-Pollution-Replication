The court order in question pertains to a dispute over seniority between Shitla Prasad Shukla and two other individuals in a college in Uttar Pradesh. Shukla had initially been working as an Assistant Teacher but started teaching Hindi in Intermediate classes despite not having the required qualifications. He applied for an exemption under Section 16E of the Uttar Pradesh Intermediate Education Act, which was granted by the Board of High School and Intermediate Education on July 23, 1963. 

Shukla argued that the exemption should be deemed to have been granted from the date of his application, but the court rejected this argument. The court noted that the exemption was granted on July 23, 1963, and therefore Shukla could not claim seniority over those who were lawfully appointed before that date. The court also discussed the issue of inter-se seniority and the importance of belonging to the same stream before claiming seniority.

The court order states that the appellant cannot claim seniority over others as he was not qualified for the position until the exemption was granted. The court also notes that the appellant was not lawfully appointed as a lecturer until the exemption was granted, and therefore cannot claim seniority over those who were lawfully appointed before him. The court dismisses the appeal.

The court's decision is based on the fact that Shukla was not qualified for the position until the exemption was granted. The court notes that the exemption was granted on July 23, 1963, and therefore Shukla cannot claim seniority over those who were lawfully appointed before that date. The court also discusses the issue of inter-se seniority and the importance of belonging to the same stream before claiming seniority.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the importance of qualifications and lawful appointment in determining seniority. The court notes that Shukla was not qualified for the position until the exemption was granted, and therefore cannot claim seniority over those who were lawfully appointed before him. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following proper procedures and regulations in making appointments and granting exemptions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of qualifications and lawful appointment in determining seniority. It also emphasizes the need to follow proper procedures and regulations in making appointments and granting exemptions.
