The case in question involves a petitioner who was granted a quarry lease for the construction of bricks-kiln. However, the lease was cancelled as the land fell within the prohibited area of Ratapani Sanctuary. The petitioner filed a revision and a writ petition, but the court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that no mining operation can be allowed in the area in question as it is covered by a notification issued under Section 18 of The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. This notification prohibits any mining activity within the sanctuary's boundaries. The court also held that since the notification was issued prior to 1991, it was not necessary to issue a notification under Section 26A of the Act.

Section 26A of The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 requires that any area declared as a sanctuary or national park after 1991 must have a notification issued under this section in order to prohibit any mining activity. However, since the Ratapani Sanctuary was declared prior to 1991, the court found that the notification issued under Section 18 was sufficient to prohibit mining activity in the area.

The court's decision was based on the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Ratapani Sanctuary is home to a variety of endangered species, and mining activity in the area could have a detrimental impact on their survival. The court recognized the need to balance economic development with environmental protection, but ultimately found that the protection of wildlife and their habitats must take precedence.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The court recognized the need to balance economic development with environmental protection, but ultimately found that the protection of wildlife and their habitats must take precedence. The decision also underscores the importance of complying with the regulations and notifications issued under The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 in order to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats.
