The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court order lists the case numbers and names of the petitioners and respondents, as well as the names of the lawyers representing them. However, no specific details about the content of the petitions are provided.

One of the court orders pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking relief from the demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur. The notice demanded the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The petitioner had already deposited compensation for the diversion of forest land, but the mining department was required to deposit NPV under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and concluded that the demand notice was legal and valid.

Another court order states that in 2001, 63 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, deposited compensation for the diversion of forest land. However, out of a total of 136 lease holders, the rest either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled, leaving the land unutilized. The Forest Department is now asking the petitioners to deposit the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for all 136 mining leases, which the petitioners argue is contrary to the law. The court also notes that a letter from the Government of India exempts forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected from the provisions of NPV. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster.

Another court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire 281 hectares.

The final court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the government over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land that was diverted for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and thus, the approval was given for the entire area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra), and also such computation shall include the common areas of transport as well as the area being utilized for storing their machines and equipments and other infrastructure, which includes offices and houses of workers etc., constructed on the said area, along with the dumping area which constitutes a part of the 281 hectare cluster area, but shall specifically exclude the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, for which appropriate relinquishment proceedings shall be pursued by the Mining Department.

In summary, the court orders relate to various civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and concluded that the demand notice for payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities was legal and valid. The court also considered the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court.
