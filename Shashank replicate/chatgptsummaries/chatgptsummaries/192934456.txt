The court order in question relates to a criminal revision filed by the petitioner, who is the legal representative of a murder victim. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was dismissed. The petitioner then filed a criminal revision against the dismissal of the application.

The court notes that a revision against the order is not maintainable as per a previous judgment by the Apex Court. The court explains that a revision is a limited remedy and can only be used to challenge the correctness, legality, or propriety of an order. In this case, the petitioner is not challenging the correctness, legality, or propriety of the order, but is instead seeking to revive the application that was dismissed. Therefore, the court holds that the revision is not maintainable.

However, the court also notes that the petitioner may still have a remedy available to them. The court grants the petitioner time to move an appropriate application to convert the criminal revision into a miscellaneous criminal case under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court explains that Section 482 gives the court inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of the court or to secure the ends of justice. If the petitioner is able to show that the dismissal of the application under Section 91 was an abuse of the process of the court or that it would secure the ends of justice to revive the application, then the court may allow the conversion of the revision into a miscellaneous criminal case.

The court sets a date for the matter to be listed for the week commencing 13th October, 2015. This means that the petitioner has until that date to file the appropriate application to convert the revision into a miscellaneous criminal case. If the petitioner is successful in doing so, then the court will hear the matter as a miscellaneous criminal case and decide whether to revive the application under Section 91.

In summary, the court order pertains to a criminal revision filed by the legal representative of a murder victim. The revision was filed against the dismissal of an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court holds that the revision is not maintainable, but grants the petitioner time to move an appropriate application to convert the revision into a miscellaneous criminal case under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The matter is listed for the week commencing 13th October, 2015.
