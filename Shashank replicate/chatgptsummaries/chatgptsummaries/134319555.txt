Phool Singh, along with other co-accused, was charged with offences punishable under Sections 9/51, 39 (3) A/51, 48A, 52/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act and Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Singh filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. The prosecution alleged that Singh and his co-accused kept a wild animal, a Pangolin, with the intention to sell it. Singh's counsel argued that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case, and that there was no direct evidence against him.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed the bail application. The court ordered Singh's release on a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties. The order would remain effective until the end of the trial, but would become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, was enacted to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also prohibits trade in wildlife and their products. The Act provides for penalties for contravention of its provisions.

Section 9 of the Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 (3) A/51 prohibits possession of any captive animal or bird. Section 48A provides for punishment for illegal trade in wildlife, while Section 52/51 provides for punishment for contravention of any provision of the Act. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code provides for punishment for acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.

In this case, the prosecution alleged that Singh and his co-accused had kept a Pangolin, a wild animal, with the intention to sell it. The Pangolin is a protected species under the Wild Life Protection Act, and its trade is prohibited. The prosecution argued that Singh and his co-accused had violated the provisions of the Act and had committed an offence.

Singh's counsel, on the other hand, argued that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. The counsel argued that there was no direct evidence against Singh and that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence. The counsel also argued that Singh had no criminal antecedents and was a law-abiding citizen.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed the bail application. The court observed that the allegations against Singh were serious, but there was no direct evidence against him. The court also observed that Singh had no criminal antecedents and was a law-abiding citizen. The court, therefore, allowed the bail application and ordered Singh's release on a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties.

The court also made it clear that the order would remain effective until the end of the trial, but would become ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that if Singh jumps bail, the order would become ineffective, and he would be liable to be arrested again.

In conclusion, the court allowed the bail application filed by Phool Singh under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for offences punishable under Sections 9/51, 39 (3) A/51, 48A, 52/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act and Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The court ordered Singh's release on a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties. The order would remain effective until the end of the trial, but would become ineffective in case of bail jump. The court observed that the allegations against Singh were serious, but there was no direct evidence against him. The court also observed that Singh had no criminal antecedents and was a law-abiding citizen.
