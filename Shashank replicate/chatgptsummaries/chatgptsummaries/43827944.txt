The Orissa High Court recently heard a writ petition from M/s Sri Hardev Steels Pvt Ltd, which sought to quash a notice and letter from the State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner requested an extension of time to install an Online Stack Monitoring System and not to start commercial production until the system was installed. The petitioner had previously filed a writ petition, which was disposed of with leave to appeal before the competent authority. The petitioner faced labour unrest and was unable to install the system within the stipulated time. The State Pollution Control Board rejected the petitioner's request for an extension of time, and the bank guarantee remained valid until 30.6.2016.

The court order discusses a dispute between a company and the State Pollution Control Board regarding the installation of an Online Stack Monitoring System. The company faced labour unrest and was unable to install the system within the stipulated time. The Pollution Control Board declined to extend the deadline, and the company's bank guarantee was forfeited. The company appealed to the court, arguing that it had not been negligent and had installed the system by the deadline. The court considered the facts and ordered the Pollution Control Board to treat the matter as complete and allow the bank guarantee to be recalled in favour of the company.

The court order also discusses an inspection report of a plant site that was shut down due to a labour strike from October 2015 to March 2016. The report also mentions the installation of an online stack monitoring system. The petitioner faced a situation beyond their control, and the opposite party was aware of the situation. The communication from the State Pollution Control Board regarding the forfeiture of a bank guarantee was unsupported. The court finds that the case falls under irretrievable injustice, and the impugned orders are quashed. The petitioner is permitted to start commercial production.
