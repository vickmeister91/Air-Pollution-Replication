The Telangana Teachers (Regulation of Teachers) Rules, 2018, which were notified in G.O.Ms. No.16, School Education (Service II) Department dated 06.06.2018, have been challenged by teachers working in government schools or schools under the control of local bodies. The petitioners have questioned the validity of the rules on various grounds, including being arbitrary, illegal, unjust, and in violation of Articles 14, 16, 21, 243G, and 371D of the Constitution of India.

The court examines the scope of judicial review in matters relating to transfers and concludes that the interference by courts with orders of transfer is limited, and transfer of an employee is an incident of service necessary in public interest and efficiency in public administration. The court also notes that unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafides or is made in violation of any operative guidelines or rules, courts should not ordinarily interfere with it.

The court then briefly refers to the provisions of the 2018 Rules, which are applicable to Head Masters/Head Mistresses Grade-II (Gazetted), School Assistants/SGTs, and other equivalent categories working in Government/Zilla Parishad/MPP Schools in the State of Telangana. The rules include online web counseling, criteria for transfers, and the competent authorities for issuing transfer and posting orders.

The court also addresses a challenge to the rules based on a previous interim order of status-quo, but ultimately finds that the rules do not violate the order. The court clarifies that the 2018 Rules do not violate the status-quo order passed in 2017 and that the amendment to the Presidential Order still exists but is inoperative for the time being.

The court discusses the application of the 1975 Presidential Order on the transfer of teachers in government and local body schools in the state of Telangana. The order clarifies that the Presidential Order only requires the organization of local cadres for teachers in government schools, not for teachers in local body schools. Therefore, transfers of teachers in government schools can only be made within the 10 districts specified in the Presidential Order, while transfers of teachers in local body schools can only be made within the 31 districts formed under the District Formation Act.

The court also notes that the State Government cannot integrate teachers in government and local body schools into a unified local cadre, as per previous court judgments. The court examines whether Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules, which prescribes the erstwhile ten districts as units of transfer, violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court concludes that the prescription of the erstwhile ten districts as a unit of transfer is not so irrational as to violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

The court states that the 2018 Rules for the transfer of teachers in Telangana are valid and do not require approval from the State Legislature. The court also rejects the argument that the Rules are a colorable legislation and that they have superseded earlier adhoc Rules. The court clarifies that the 2018 Rules have only superseded the transfer rules notified in G.O.Ms. No.15 dated 26.01.2009, and not the rules notified in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009.

The court discusses various constitutional provisions and judgments related to the legislative power of the Governor and the validity of rules made under Article 309 of the Constitution. It also examines the effect of the repeal of the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Samithis, Zilla Parishads Act, 1959 and the validity of rules made under it. The court concludes that the 2018 Rules made under the proviso to Article 309 are valid and that the earlier rules made under the 1959 Act have been repealed.

The court finds that the 2018 Rules have statutory force, but the executive instructions are merely in the nature of executive instructions and cannot override the provisions of the Rules. The court also rejects several contentions made by the petitioners, including the legality of web counseling for transfers and the priority given to spouse cases in the Rules.

However, the court finds that Rule 4 of the 2018 Rules, which designates the District Educational Officers of the erstwhile districts as the competent authority for transfers, is irrational and violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court has declared Rule 4 of the 2018 Rules unconstitutional as it violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

In conclusion, the court has upheld the validity of the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of Teachers) Rules, 2018, with the exception of Rule 4, which has been declared unconstitutional. The court has clarified various provisions related to transfers and promotions of teachers in government and local body schools in Telangana, and has provided guidance on the limits of judicial review in such matters.
