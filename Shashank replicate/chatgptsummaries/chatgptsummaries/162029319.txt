The case against Singh was registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Singh was apprehensive of his arrest in connection with the case registered against him, and therefore filed a bail application under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. Section 438 of Cr.P.C. provides for the grant of anticipatory bail to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offense. The provision allows a person to approach the court for anticipatory bail before his arrest, and if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for granting bail, it may direct that the person be released on bail.

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the bail application filed by Singh and directed that he be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Arresting Police Officer. The court also directed Singh to make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and abide by other conditions enumerated in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

The conditions enumerated in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. include that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required; that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer; and that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court.

In conclusion, the court granted anticipatory bail to Bodhraj Singh in connection with a case registered against him under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court directed that Singh be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Arresting Police Officer. Singh was also directed to make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and abide by other conditions enumerated in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. The case highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats.
