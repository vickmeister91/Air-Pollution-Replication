In the case of WLI vs Ramesh Chander Tondon, the accused was charged with violating provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act by dealing in animal articles without proper authorization. The case was filed by Mr. V.B. Dasan, the then Wild Life Inspector, for illegal trade of snake skin articles. A raid was conducted at the business premises of the accused and 25 ladies bags made of Indian Corba (Naja Naja) skins and 2 ladies bags made of Dhaman or Rat Snake skins were recovered. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, but the prosecution proved the case with the help of three witnesses. The accused failed to produce any legal source of procurement or any document or license or any authority to keep, possession or to take the same. The accused was sentenced on 4th October 2012.

During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses who identified the accused and the recovered items, while the defense argued that the accused was falsely implicated and that no public witnesses were present during the alleged recovery. The court found the prosecution's evidence to be convincing and rejected the defense's arguments, ultimately finding the accused guilty of the charges.

The court convicted Ramesh Chander Tondon under section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for contravention of provisions of section 49 & 49B of the Act. The accused was found in possession of bags made from the skins of protected snakes, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The accused's defense was that he did not know the bags contained snake skins and that they belonged to someone else. However, the court found that the accused's actions and statements were suspicious and indicated a connection to the bags. The court also noted that the identity of the bags and their contents were not disputed by the defense during cross-examination. Therefore, the accused was found guilty and convicted of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

In summary, Ramesh Chander Tondon was found guilty of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by dealing in animal articles without proper authorization. The prosecution presented convincing evidence, including witness testimony and recovered items, while the defense's arguments were rejected by the court. The accused was sentenced on 4th October 2012. The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and the consequences of violating laws designed to do so.
