The court order in question relates to an appeal filed by Shiv-Sneha Associates and others challenging an order passed by a Single Judge in a Commercial Execution Application. The learned Judge had passed an interim order which was to continue until a separate application filed by the defendants for recall of the order was disposed of. The defendants were restrained from dealing with or encumbering the immovable property, including the building known as "Daulat Classic". The court rejected the appeal and disposed of the notice of motion.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the ownership of a property known as "Daulat Classic". The plaintiffs, Shiv-Sneha Associates and others, had filed a Commercial Execution Application seeking to recover a debt owed to them by the defendants. The learned Single Judge had passed an interim order restraining the defendants from dealing with or encumbering the property until a separate application filed by the defendants for recall of the order was disposed of.

The defendants had filed an application for recall of the interim order, which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge. The defendants then filed an appeal challenging the order of the learned Single Judge. The appeal was heard by a Division Bench of the court.

The Division Bench, after hearing the arguments of both parties, rejected the appeal and disposed of the notice of motion. The court held that the interim order passed by the learned Single Judge was justified in the circumstances of the case and that there was no reason to interfere with the same.

The court observed that the defendants had failed to make out a case for recall of the interim order. The court noted that the defendants had not produced any material to show that they were the owners of the property in question or that they had any right to deal with or encumber the same. The court also observed that the defendants had not produced any material to show that they had any other property which could be attached in lieu of the property in question.

The court further observed that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case for recovery of the debt owed to them by the defendants. The court noted that the plaintiffs had produced documentary evidence to show that the defendants had executed a promissory note in their favour and that the same was due and payable.

In light of the above, the court held that the interim order passed by the learned Single Judge was justified and that there was no reason to interfere with the same. The court accordingly rejected the appeal and disposed of the notice of motion.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by Shiv-Sneha Associates and others challenging an order passed by a Single Judge in a Commercial Execution Application. The court rejected the appeal and disposed of the notice of motion. The court held that the interim order passed by the learned Single Judge was justified in the circumstances of the case and that there was no reason to interfere with the same. The court observed that the defendants had failed to make out a case for recall of the interim order and that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case for recovery of the debt owed to them by the defendants.
