The case of Jai Kumar Nuwal involved a criminal misc. petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Addl. Sessions Judge No.3, Bhilwara, in Sessions Case No.27/2014. The petitioner had moved an application under Sections 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. for taking certain documents on record relating to the treatment of the injured persons at Ahmedabad in a private hospital. However, the trial court rejected the application, stating that the documents were not reliable and had not been presented to the investigating officer during the course of investigation.

The High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur allowed the petition and quashed the impugned order, ordering the trial court to allow the application preferred on behalf of the petitioner under Sections 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. in Sessions Case No.27/2014. This decision was based on the fact that the documents in question were relevant to the case and could not be disregarded simply because they had not been presented to the investigating officer during the course of investigation.

The court held that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application and that the documents should be allowed to be taken on record. The court also noted that the trial court had not given any reasons for rejecting the application and had not considered the relevance of the documents to the case.

The decision of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur highlights the importance of considering all relevant evidence in a case, regardless of whether it was presented to the investigating officer during the course of investigation. The court emphasized that the trial court should have considered the relevance of the documents to the case and given reasons for rejecting the application.

Overall, the decision in the case of Jai Kumar Nuwal serves as a reminder that all relevant evidence should be considered in a case and that the court should provide reasons for its decisions. This decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that the trial court follows proper procedures and considers all relevant evidence before making a decision.
