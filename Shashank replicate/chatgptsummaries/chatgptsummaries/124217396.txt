M/s. Leatheroid Plastics Pvt. Ltd. filed a lawsuit against BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd. for an illegal and arbitrary bill of Rs. 4,61,416/- and for a mandatory injunction to refund the amount paid during the period of disconnection from the date of sealing of premises. The plaintiff's factory premises were sealed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee between 8.1.98 and 13.4.98, during which no electricity was consumed, but bills were continuously raised. The defendant denied the allegations and claimed that the suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. The court heard the final arguments on 11.07.09 and delivered the judgment on 27.07.09.

The court order discusses several issues related to the lawsuit, including whether the court has jurisdiction to try the case, whether the plaintiff has valued their suit property correctly, whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of parties, whether the relief of declaration is time-barred, and whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of declaration and mandatory injunction. The court ultimately decides in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the impugned bill illegal and null and void, and directing the defendant to refinalize the electricity bills and refund any excess amount paid.

The court has declared the Estate in Badarpur, New Delhi as illegal and null. The defendant is ordered to adjust the electricity bills of the plaintiff by deducting the charges for the period when the factory premises were sealed and refund any excess amount paid. The plaintiff is awarded the cost of the suit, and the decree sheet is to be prepared accordingly. The announcement was made on July 27, 2009.
