The court order pertains to a contempt petition filed against a poultry farm for violating directions issued by the court regarding air pollution caused by industries and establishments, including poultry farms. The court was informed that the Union of India had issued norms and standards for ambient air quality emitted by such industries and poultry farms. The court disposed of the petition, directing authorities to take action against units not maintaining standards laid down in the notification issued by the Central Board.

The contempt petition was filed alleging violation of directions dated 03.07.2012 of the court. The court held that the challenge posed to the order giving consent to operate and grievance against the Tribunal's order cannot be entertained in contempt proceedings. The court emphasized that the power to punish for contempt should be used sparingly and only when there has been deliberate disobedience of a court order. The court also notes that the contempt jurisdiction should not be used to enter into questions that have not been dealt with in the original order.

The court order cites a previous decision by the Supreme Court regarding the purpose and limitations of the contempt jurisdiction. The court dismisses the petition in this case, but allows the petitioner to pursue remedies against a policy adopted by the State of Haryana.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of adhering to environmental norms and standards laid down by the Central Board. The court's directive to take action against units not maintaining these standards is a step towards ensuring that industries and establishments, including poultry farms, do not contribute to air pollution.

The court's emphasis on the limited scope of the contempt jurisdiction is also noteworthy. The court's decision to dismiss the petition in this case, while allowing the petitioner to pursue remedies against a policy adopted by the State of Haryana, is a reminder that the contempt jurisdiction should not be used to enter into questions that have not been dealt with in the original order.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to environmental norms and standards, and the limited scope of the contempt jurisdiction. It is hoped that this decision will encourage industries and establishments, including poultry farms, to take steps to reduce their impact on the environment and comply with the norms and standards laid down by the Central Board.
