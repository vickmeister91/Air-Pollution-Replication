The Madhya Pradesh High Court has granted permission to the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board to appeal against the acquittal of M/s Gwalior Distillers Limited Rairu and others under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the trial court had not correctly appreciated evidence and material available on record and had committed errors of law. The matter was directed to be registered as a criminal appeal.

The case pertains to the pollution caused by M/s Gwalior Distillers Limited Rairu, a distillery located in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. The company was accused of discharging untreated effluent into the nearby river, which resulted in the pollution of the river and the surrounding areas. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the company and its officials under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The trial court had acquitted the accused on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. However, the Madhya Pradesh High Court found that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence and material available on record. The court noted that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence to prove that the accused had discharged untreated effluent into the river, which had resulted in the pollution of the river and the surrounding areas.

The court also found that the trial court had committed errors of law in its judgment. The trial court had held that the accused could not be held liable for the pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent into the river, as the effluent had been treated before being discharged. However, the Madhya Pradesh High Court held that the trial court had misinterpreted the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court noted that the Act prohibited the discharge of any untreated effluent into any water body, irrespective of whether the effluent had been treated or not.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court also found that the trial court had erred in holding that the accused could not be held liable for the pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent into the river, as the pollution had occurred downstream of the discharge point. The court held that the trial court had failed to appreciate the fact that the pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent into the river was a continuous process, and that the pollution continued downstream of the discharge point.

In light of these findings, the Madhya Pradesh High Court allowed the application filed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board to appeal against the acquittal of M/s Gwalior Distillers Limited Rairu and others under sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The matter was directed to be registered as a criminal appeal.

This judgment is significant as it reaffirms the importance of strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. It also highlights the need for courts to correctly interpret and apply the provisions of environmental laws, in order to ensure that polluters are held accountable for their actions. The judgment is likely to have a deterrent effect on polluters, as it sends a strong message that environmental violations will not be tolerated and that polluters will be held accountable for their actions.
