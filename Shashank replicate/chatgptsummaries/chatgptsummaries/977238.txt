The Madras High Court recently considered a writ petition filed by S. Sundaram and two others against ICICI Bank Limited. The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to grant them pensions in accordance with the Bank of Madura Employees Pension Regulation, 1995, based on the 10-month average emoluments last drawn by the petitioners with attendant D.A. and arrears of commutation from the date of retirement of each of the petitioners. The court considered whether a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution is maintainable against a private banker.

The court order discussed a pension scheme introduced by a bank in 2003 for eligible employees who opt for early retirement. The bank calculates the pension based on the last drawn 10 months' average basic pay, while the petitioners argued that it should be based on the revised salary without a component of Dearness Allowance. The court clarified the maintainability of a writ petition against a private bank and noted that pension is not a property but a matter of right subject to the law and regulations. The employer must consider the claim of the employee for payment of pension strictly in accordance with the law or regulations.

The court order stated that the payment of pension is a right earned by employees for long service and is not a charity or bounty. Employers must consider claims for pension strictly in accordance with the law and regulations. The right to receive pension is a condition of service and cannot be denied. The court also noted that pension regulations are non-statutory in character and that a writ cannot be issued where there is no non-compliance or violation of any statutory provision. In this specific case, the bank is paying the pension as per the rules and regulations, and the petitioners have no case on both the merits and jurisdiction. The writ petition was dismissed.

The court's decision highlights the importance of adhering to the law and regulations when it comes to the payment of pensions. Pension is not a property but a right earned by employees for long service, and employers must consider claims for pension strictly in accordance with the law and regulations.
