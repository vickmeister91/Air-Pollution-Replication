Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a summary for any of the court order summaries provided. The first summary appears to be a court order between the Karnataka State Board of Wakf and Sri Ismail Khan, but the text is not in a readable format and contains many symbols and characters that are difficult to interpret. Without further context or a properly formatted version of the text, it is impossible to provide a summary.

The second and third summaries are also not possible to summarize as they appear to be a jumbled collection of letters, symbols, and numbers with no coherent meaning or structure. The fourth summary states that the text provided is a random combination of characters and symbols that do not make sense and cannot be summarized. 

In order to provide a summary, a valid text with proper formatting and context is required. Without this, it is impossible to provide any meaningful summary of the court orders.
