The Kerala High Court recently heard a batch of petitions challenging the orders of the appellate authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioners, the Pulp Division and Staple Fibre Division of the Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co., argued that the Pulp Division was not a "specified industry" and therefore not subject to the cess. However, the court examined the schemes of both the Pollution Act and the Cess Act and found that the Pulp Division was a chemical industry and subject to the cess. 

The court also examined the powers and functions of the Board under the Pollution Act, including laying down standards for trade effluents and making orders for the prevention, control, or abatement of discharges. The court ultimately upheld the orders of the appellate authority. 

In another case, the court discussed a company that produces pulp from wood or bamboo, which involves large quantities of water that get polluted in the process. The company was assessed a cess (tax) under Act 36/77 for large-scale consumption of water likely to aggravate water pollution. The company argued that the pulp produced was not a chemical, but the court found that it was a chemical like salt and sugar. 

The company also argued that the appellate committee was biased, but the court found that the committee was the prescribed appellate forum. The company further argued that it was entitled to a rebate under Section 7 of the Cess Act for installing a treatment plant, but the appellate committee had declined to grant the rebate. 

The court found that the rule-making authority could not cut down the sweep of Section 7 by adding further conditions of its own, and that the effluent treatment plant of the company prevented pollution to some extent. The court set aside the orders of the appellate committee and the reassessment orders of the assessing authority, and directed the assessing authority to pass fresh orders allowing the claim for rebate. 

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court has upheld the orders of the appellate authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and has directed the assessing authority to pass fresh orders allowing the claim for rebate in another case. The court has also clarified that the Pulp Division is a chemical industry and subject to the cess. No costs are to be incurred in either case.
