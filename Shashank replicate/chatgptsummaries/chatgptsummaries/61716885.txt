The court recently heard three writ petitions and disposed of them in a common order. The petitioner, a daily wager, was terminated from his job as a lifeguard without a show cause notice or hearing after an unfortunate accident resulting in the death of a boy. The court found that the principles of natural justice and fair play were not followed in the termination of the petitioner's services. The court explained the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings and quoted extensively from the case of Uma Nath Pandey v. State of U.P. to explain the concept.

The court order discusses the concept of natural justice and its evolution over time. It emphasizes the importance of the principles of natural justice in ensuring a fair hearing and preventing miscarriage of justice. The order also discusses the two basic elements of a fair hearing, namely 'nemo judex in causa sua' (no one shall be a judge in their own cause) and 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side). The order also touches upon the disputed nature of the useless formality test in cases where all facts are not admitted or beyond dispute. Finally, the order notes that natural justice is the essence of fair adjudication and deeply rooted in tradition and conscience.

The court order emphasizes the importance of natural justice and the principles of audi alteram partem, which ensure that all parties are heard before a decision is made. The court notes that not following these principles can result in arbitrary decisions that are unfair and violate the principles of equality and due process. In this case, the court quashes a stigmatic order and directs the respondents to allow the petitioner to continue as a Daily Wager, but without back wages. All writ petitions are allowed.
