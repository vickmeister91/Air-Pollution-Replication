The court order in question is related to a case between M/S. Kanti Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The petitioner's counsel has argued that the Managing Director of the company does not fall under the term "every person" as per section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act. The court has stayed the proceedings initiated by the respondent until the next hearing and has issued a notice to the respondent to appear in court within four weeks.

The case revolves around the interpretation of section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act, which states that "every person" who is discharging or likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land shall apply to the State Pollution Control Board for consent to establish or operate any industrial plant. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had initiated proceedings against M/S. Kanti Beverages Pvt. Ltd. for allegedly discharging untreated effluent into a nearby stream without obtaining the necessary consent.

The petitioner's counsel has argued that the Managing Director of the company cannot be held liable under section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act as he is not discharging or likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or sewer or on land. The counsel has further argued that the term "every person" in the section refers to the person who is actually discharging or likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent and not to the Managing Director of the company.

The court has considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner's counsel and has stayed the proceedings initiated by the respondent until the next hearing. The court has also issued a notice to the respondent to appear in court within four weeks. The court's decision to stay the proceedings indicates that it has found merit in the petitioner's argument that the Managing Director of the company cannot be held liable under section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act.

The case highlights the importance of interpreting legal provisions correctly and the need for clarity in the language used in such provisions. The interpretation of section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act has been a subject of debate in this case, and the court's decision will have implications for similar cases in the future.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between M/S. Kanti Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board pertains to the interpretation of section 47(1) & (2) of the Water Act. The petitioner's counsel has argued that the Managing Director of the company cannot be held liable under the section, and the court has stayed the proceedings initiated by the respondent until the next hearing. The case highlights the importance of interpreting legal provisions correctly and the need for clarity in the language used in such provisions.
