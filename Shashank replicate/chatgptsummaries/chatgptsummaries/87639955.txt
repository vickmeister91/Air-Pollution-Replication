The National Green Tribunal heard appeals from various granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appeals were filed in response to orders issued on July 29, 2013. The case was heard on December 6, 2013, and the judgment was delivered by Hon'ble Justice Shri M. Chockalingam.

The court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The appellants argue that their units do not cause air or water pollution and have not violated any environmental laws. They also claim that they were not given an opportunity to be heard before the closure orders were issued. The respondent/Board argues that the closure orders were issued in accordance with the law and that the appellants did not obtain necessary consents to establish or operate their units. The court is tasked with determining whether the closure orders were legal and whether the consequential directions to disconnect power supply were also illegal.

The court order states that the appellants in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ) obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts and that can be termed as illegally obtained. The Government of Karnataka issued a Notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities in the said zones. The Board has also prepared a map wherein Zone 3 specified the distance factor as 1 km from the river bank and the industries of all the appellants have been established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank and many of them even without obtaining consent for establishment. The court dismissed all the appeals and sustained the directions for closure of the units of the appellants.

The court order discusses the closure of industries under challenge, which were issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The closure was in violation of FEE 215 ENV 2000 and a government order dated 12.01.2004, which were issued to protect the TGR catchment area. The government of Karnataka issued a notification classifying the TGR catchment area into 4 zones, specifying the nature of activities in each zone. The closure directions were issued without providing an opportunity to file objections against the proposed direction. The court rejected the appellants' contentions and upheld the closure of the units. The appellants were directed to remove all machinery and materials within a period of 3 months.

In summary, the court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The court was tasked with determining whether the closure orders were legal and whether the consequential directions to disconnect power supply were also illegal. The court found that the appellants obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts and that the closure directions were issued in accordance with the law. The court also found that the closure was in violation of FEE 215 ENV 2000 and a government order dated 12.01.2004, which were issued to protect the TGR catchment area. The court upheld the closure of the units and directed the appellants to remove all machinery and materials within a period of 3 months.
