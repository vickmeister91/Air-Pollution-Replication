The court order pertains to two separate cases filed in the State of Himachal Pradesh. In the first case, M/s Holiday Hill challenged a notice issued by the Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board calling upon them to show cause as to why action for not complying with various provisions of law should not be taken. The notice was issued on the grounds that the petitioner had violated various provisions of law related to construction and pollution control. The court passed an order on June 23, 2017, directing the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The court also directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing. The petitioner filed a personal affidavit in compliance with the court's directions.

In the second case, the petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws and compoundable limits. The court notes that similar cases have been filed and passed separate orders in each of them. The petitioner had filed the writ petition on the grounds that the authorities had failed to consider the applicability of Section 31-B of the Town and Country Planning Act. However, the vires of such provision have been held to be ultra vires in a separate writ petition. The petitioner seeks permission to withdraw the present writ petition, which is permitted subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The writ petition is disposed of as having been withdrawn.

In both cases, the court is concerned with violations of laws related to construction and pollution control. The court is taking a strict stance on these violations and is directing the petitioners to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The court is also taking a cautious approach by not allowing any coercive action to be taken until the next date of hearing. This shows that the court is willing to give the petitioners a chance to comply with the law and rectify their mistakes.

In the second case, the court notes that similar cases have been filed and passed separate orders in each of them. This shows that the court is dealing with these cases on a case-by-case basis and is not taking a one-size-fits-all approach. The court is also aware of the applicability of Section 31-B of the Town and Country Planning Act and has held that the vires of such provision have been held to be ultra vires in a separate writ petition. This shows that the court is well-versed in the law and is taking a nuanced approach to these cases.

Overall, these court orders show that the court is taking a strict stance on violations of laws related to construction and pollution control. The court is willing to give the petitioners a chance to comply with the law and rectify their mistakes, but is also taking a cautious approach by not allowing any coercive action to be taken until the next date of hearing. The court is dealing with these cases on a case-by-case basis and is taking a nuanced approach to these cases.
