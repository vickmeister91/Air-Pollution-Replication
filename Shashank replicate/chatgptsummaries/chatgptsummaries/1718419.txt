The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/S Waterline Pipes against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner challenged a notice issued by the Board, which withheld consent for the operation of an industrial unit until certain directions were complied with. The court directed the petitioner to file an appeal before the Air and Water Appellate Tribunal, which has been done. The court ordered that the Authority will take a decision in the appeal after hearing the petitioner and until then, the status quo will continue. The writ petition has been disposed of accordingly.

The case pertains to an industrial unit owned by M/S Waterline Pipes, which had applied for consent to operate from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued a notice to the petitioner, withholding consent until certain directions were complied with. The petitioner challenged the notice, stating that the directions were arbitrary and unreasonable. The petitioner also argued that the Board had not given them an opportunity to be heard before issuing the notice.

The court, after hearing both parties, directed the petitioner to file an appeal before the Air and Water Appellate Tribunal. The court also ordered that until the appeal is decided, the status quo will continue. This means that the industrial unit can continue to operate as it was before the notice was issued, subject to any conditions that were already in place.

The Air and Water Appellate Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body that hears appeals against orders passed by the Pollution Control Boards. The Tribunal has the power to confirm, modify or set aside the orders passed by the Boards. The Tribunal also has the power to pass any order that the Board could have passed under the relevant laws.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against them. The court also recognized the importance of the right to carry on a lawful business, which is protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.

The court's order also highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the Pollution Control Boards in ensuring compliance with environmental laws. The court recognized that the directions issued by the Board were aimed at protecting the environment and that compliance with these directions was necessary for the operation of the industrial unit.

In conclusion, the court's order in the writ petition filed by M/S Waterline Pipes against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and the right to carry on a lawful business. The order also recognizes the importance of environmental protection and the role of the Pollution Control Boards in ensuring compliance with environmental laws. The order directs the petitioner to file an appeal before the Air and Water Appellate Tribunal, which will take a decision after hearing the petitioner. Until then, the status quo will continue.
