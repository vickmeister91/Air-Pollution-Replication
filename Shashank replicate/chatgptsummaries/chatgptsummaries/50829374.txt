In the first court order, the petitioner, P. Ramaiah, filed a petition seeking police protection for Rt. Rev. Dr. H.A. Martin, Bishop TELC, and office bearers of TELC on 28.11.2015 and two months thereafter at Tranquebar House, Trichy-1 to avoid untoward incidents. The case involved a dispute between Rt. Rev. Dr. H.A. Martin and E.D. Charles over the administration of TELC properties. However, the court found that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition and had misled the court by filing a frivolous petition. As a result, the court dismissed the petition.

The second court order emphasizes the responsibility of a client to offer advice about ends and not just be a servant to their client. The petitioner in this case has misled the court and wasted its time by filing a frivolous petition. The court finds that the petitioner has not approached the court with clean hands and dismisses the petition with a cost of Rs. 10,000 payable to a non-governmental organization for the welfare of those affected by recent floods.

In summary, both court orders involve a petitioner who has filed a frivolous petition and misled the court. The first court order specifically deals with a dispute over the administration of TELC properties, while the second court order emphasizes the responsibility of a client to offer advice about ends. In both cases, the court dismisses the petition and imposes a cost on the petitioner. The cost in the second court order is to be paid to a non-governmental organization for the welfare of those affected by recent floods.
