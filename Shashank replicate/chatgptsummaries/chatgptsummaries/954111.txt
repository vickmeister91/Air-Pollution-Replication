The court order in question pertains to an appeal in execution of a compromise decree in a suit for partition. The plaintiff, a junior widow, had claimed partition of various items of land, including a protected Thekadari Gountia share of mouza Laikera. The compromise decree provided for a six-anna-share of the protected land for the plaintiff's maintenance and a five-anna-share of other items of property. The plaintiff had applied for the appointment of a commissioner to effect the partition, which was opposed by the defendant. 

The court held that a commissioner can be appointed in execution proceedings if the parties have agreed to it by compromise. This means that if the parties have agreed to the appointment of a commissioner in the compromise decree, then the court can appoint one in the execution proceedings. The court also held that the provision in the decree providing for a six-anna-share of the protected land for the plaintiff's maintenance is not opposed to the legal prohibition contained in Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act. 

Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act prohibits the transfer of a protected Thekadari Gountia share of land. However, the court held that the provision in the compromise decree providing for a six-anna-share of the protected land for the plaintiff's maintenance is not a transfer of the land. Rather, it is a provision for the plaintiff's maintenance out of the income of the land. Therefore, the provision is not opposed to the legal prohibition contained in Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act.

The court's decision in this case has important implications for the appointment of commissioners in execution proceedings and the interpretation of Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act. The court's ruling that a commissioner can be appointed in execution proceedings if the parties have agreed to it by compromise provides clarity on the appointment of commissioners in such proceedings. This ruling will be helpful in cases where the parties have agreed to the appointment of a commissioner in the compromise decree but are facing opposition in the execution proceedings.

The court's interpretation of Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act is also significant. The court's ruling that the provision in the compromise decree providing for a six-anna-share of the protected land for the plaintiff's maintenance is not opposed to the legal prohibition contained in Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act provides clarity on the interpretation of this provision. This ruling will be helpful in cases where there is a dispute over the interpretation of Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the appointment of commissioners in execution proceedings and the interpretation of Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act. The court's ruling that a commissioner can be appointed in execution proceedings if the parties have agreed to it by compromise and that the provision in the compromise decree providing for a six-anna-share of the protected land for the plaintiff's maintenance is not opposed to the legal prohibition contained in Section 65-A, Sub-section (4) (a), C. P. Land Revenue Act will be helpful in resolving disputes in similar cases.
