The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a judgment in a group of writ petitions filed by individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitions challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, and sought to quash a notification issued by the state government declaring certain forest land as protected forest. The petitioners argued that the provision was violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India, and that the notification was illegal and liable to be quashed. The state government, on the other hand, argued that the provision was necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) of the Act of 1953 was issued, and that the notification was well within the framework of the law.

After hearing both sides, the court ultimately held that the provision was not violative of Article 19(1)(g) and that the notification was legal and valid. The court also noted the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover, and cited previous cases where the Supreme Court had intervened in public interest to protect and preserve the environment.

The court order also discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle. The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area.

The court's decision to uphold the notification declaring certain forest land as protected forest is a significant step towards preserving the environment and protecting forest cover. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision is in line with previous judgments of the Supreme Court, which have consistently emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover. The court's appointment of committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court is also a positive step towards ensuring that environmental protection laws are effectively implemented.

Overall, the court's judgment in this case is a significant step towards protecting the environment and preserving forest cover. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision to uphold the notification declaring certain forest land as protected forest is a positive step towards preserving the environment and protecting forest cover.
