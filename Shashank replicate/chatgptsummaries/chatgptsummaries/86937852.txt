The petitioner in this case had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking the release of his tractor with trolley on superdari in a case registered against him. The trial court had earlier rejected his application for release, and the revision petition was also dismissed. The petitioner had claimed that the vehicle was lying in police custody and would become scrap if not released soon.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and set aside the orders passed by the lower courts. The trial court was directed to release the vehicle on superdari to the petitioner, subject to his furnishing necessary bonds.

The concept of superdari is a legal provision that allows a person to take possession of their property that has been seized by the police during an investigation. The person is required to furnish a bond to the court, which ensures that they will produce the property whenever required by the court.

In this case, the court found that the petitioner had a valid claim to the tractor with trolley, and that it was necessary to release the vehicle to prevent it from becoming scrap. The court also noted that the petitioner had furnished the necessary bonds, which ensured that he would produce the vehicle whenever required by the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the superdari provision in protecting the rights of individuals whose property has been seized by the police. It also underscores the need for courts to carefully consider the facts of each case before making a decision.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was a just and fair one, as it allowed the petitioner to reclaim his property while also ensuring that he would comply with any future court orders related to the case.
