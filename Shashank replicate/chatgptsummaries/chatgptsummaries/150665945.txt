The Madras High Court recently heard a writ appeal filed by Chokkar against Ramky Energy and Environment Ltd. The first respondent had sought police protection for its employees, premises, and vehicles for handling bio-medical waste. The appellant argued that the first respondent did not have the requisite environmental clearance and that they were not given an opportunity to explain their position. The court disposed of the appeal with the consent of both parties. 

During the hearing, the court referred to a judgment of the National Green Tribunal in Haat Supreme Wastech Private Ltd. & Others v. State of Haryana and Others, which found that bio-medical treatment plants required environmental clearance. The court also referred to a previous order passed by a Division Bench of the court, which directed the second respondent to give adequate police protection to the first respondent only for the purpose of maintenance and trial of the petitioner unit.

The court order directs the petitioner and the first respondent to be informed of the decision. A retired professor of medicine is added to the panel to inspect the unit. The petitioner is not allowed to use their vehicle for running the unit, only for trial running and maintenance. The court also orders a health screening camp to be conducted.

The first respondent's unit does not require environmental clearance from the Central Government. The writ appeal is dismissed, and the direction to provide police protection to the first respondent holds good.
