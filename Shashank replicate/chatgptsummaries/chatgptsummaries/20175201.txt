The case in question pertains to the seizure of a tractor and trolley by the police in connection with FIR No.0117/2017. The petitioner, Pushpendra Singh Jadaun, claimed that the tractor and trolley were not involved in any illegal activity and were merely case property. However, the Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, refused to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner, which was upheld by the Session Judge, Karauli.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. in the High Court of Rajasthan, seeking to set aside the order passed by the Session Judge and the Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner's counsel argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in any illegal activity and were merely case property. The counsel further argued that no confiscation proceedings were pending against the tractor and trolley, and therefore, they should be released to the petitioner.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the High Court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner. However, the court imposed certain conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley. The court directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 with the trial court as a security deposit.

The court further directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner only after the petitioner had complied with the conditions imposed by the court. The court also directed the trial court to ensure that the tractor and trolley were released to the petitioner in the presence of the investigating officer.

The court's decision to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner was based on the fact that no confiscation proceedings were pending against the tractor and trolley, and they were merely case property. The court also noted that the petitioner had a legitimate claim over the tractor and trolley and that their continued detention was causing hardship to the petitioner.
