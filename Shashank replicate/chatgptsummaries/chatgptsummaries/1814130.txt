In a recent case, a petitioner filed a writ petition seeking the renewal of a mining lease that had been granted for a period of five years. The petitioner had applied for renewal before the expiry date, but the District Magistrate did not pass any order on the renewal application as a 'No Objection Certificate' was required from the Forest Department. The petitioner requested a writ of mandamus to direct the District Magistrate to consider the renewal application without the certificate.

The court examined the case and ruled that a fresh 'No Objection Certificate' was required for renewal, and the District Magistrate must obtain it before deciding on the renewal application. The Divisional Forest Officer must issue the certificate within ten days of receiving the District Magistrate's letter, and the entire process must be completed within two months.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the mining lease was granted subject to certain conditions, including the requirement for a 'No Objection Certificate' from the Forest Department. The court noted that the renewal of the lease was also subject to the same conditions, and therefore, a fresh certificate was required.

The court also observed that the District Magistrate had not taken any action on the renewal application for a considerable period, which had caused undue delay and hardship to the petitioner. The court directed the District Magistrate to consider the renewal application expeditiously and complete the process within two months.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with the conditions attached to mining leases and other permits. It also emphasizes the need for government officials to act promptly and efficiently in processing applications and issuing certificates.

In conclusion, the court's ruling in this case provides clarity on the requirements for renewing mining leases and underscores the importance of timely and efficient processing of applications by government officials. The decision serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to comply with the conditions attached to permits and licenses and to act in a timely and efficient manner to avoid unnecessary delays and hardships.
