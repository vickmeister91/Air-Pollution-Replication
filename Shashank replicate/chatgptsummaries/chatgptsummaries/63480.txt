The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case involving a small-scale industry that was challenging an order from the Karnataka State Pollution Board prohibiting them from operating their business without obtaining a clearance certificate. The court found that the industry was located in an area declared as an Air Pollution Control Area and that they had not obtained the necessary consent for emissions from the Board. The court rejected the industry's argument that the Board had not complied with Rule 19 and had no authority to take action. The court also found that the Board's order to close the industry was not an order contemplated by Section 23 of the Act.

The court order pertains to a case involving an industry that did not obtain consent from the Board to operate. The court found that the direction to close down the factory solely because it did not obtain consent was illegal and not a remedial measure to mitigate air pollution. The court also found that there was a violation of Rule 19 regarding notification requirements. However, the court did not find this to be material to the case.

The court ordered the petitioner to file an application for consent in the prescribed form and pay the requisite fees and other requirements. The petitioner would be allowed to operate the industry until consent is specifically refused. The Board was directed to give clearance and proper guidelines to the petitioner. The court allowed the petition and quashed the prohibitory order.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining necessary consent and clearance certificates from the pollution control board before operating any industry. The court found that the industry had not obtained the necessary consent for emissions from the Board, which was a violation of the law. The court also rejected the industry's argument that the Board had no authority to take action, as the industry was located in an area declared as an Air Pollution Control Area.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to operate the industry until consent is specifically refused is a reasonable approach. It ensures that the industry can continue to operate while complying with the necessary regulations and obtaining the required clearance certificates. The court's direction to the Board to give clearance and proper guidelines to the petitioner is also a positive step towards ensuring that industries operate in an environmentally responsible manner.

The court's finding that the direction to close down the factory solely because it did not obtain consent was illegal and not a remedial measure to mitigate air pollution is also significant. It highlights the need for a balanced approach towards enforcing environmental regulations. While it is important to ensure that industries comply with the necessary regulations, it is also important to ensure that remedial measures are proportionate and do not result in undue hardship for the industry.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive step towards ensuring that industries operate in an environmentally responsible manner while also ensuring that they are not unduly burdened by regulatory requirements. It highlights the importance of obtaining necessary consent and clearance certificates from the pollution control board before operating any industry and the need for a balanced approach towards enforcing environmental regulations.
