The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Subhashrao Awad against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others. The petitioner was aggrieved by an order passed by the respondents treating a certain period as dies-non without giving him an opportunity of hearing. The court held that the respondents violated the principles of natural justice and fair play by passing the order without granting any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court also explained the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.

The court order discusses the importance of natural justice in fair adjudication, which includes the principles of "nemo judex in causa sua" (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The court notes that the concept of natural justice has evolved over time and is not always explicitly stated in statutes. The court also discusses the disputed nature of the "useless formality theory" in relation to natural justice. The court concludes that the principles of natural justice are firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantee equality before the law and equal protection of the law.

The court order emphasizes the importance of natural justice and procedural safeguards in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The audi alteram partem rule, which enforces the equality clause in Article 14, must be followed in administrative orders that adversely affect a party unless excluded by law. Similarly, Article 21 requires that no person be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law, which includes the right to be heard. The court quashes an order terminating the petitioner's employment as no opportunity for a hearing was granted, and the writ petition is allowed and disposed of.
