The Supreme Court of India recently passed an order pertaining to a petition filed by Aashirwad Filling Station seeking the quashing of an order passed by the National Green Tribunal that restrained the entire state of Punjab from felling and cutting any tree. The petitioner had received all necessary permissions and 'no objection certificates' for felling and cutting trees for the construction of a petrol pump. The court stayed the operation of the impugned order and disposed of the writ petition in terms of the order passed by the Supreme Court in an appeal arising out of the same order. The Supreme Court had permitted the State of Punjab to approach the learned Tribunal for vacation of the stay part of the said order qua National Highway No. 71 so that the ongoing project would not be adversely affected.

The order suspends a ban on felling trees for four months to allow ongoing highway projects to continue, but the tribunal can still pass fresh orders based on information provided by the State of Punjab. The petitioner and respondent can raise contentions in the tribunal after the four-month period. The order was passed by the Supreme Court on 28 October 2016 and the writ petition was disposed of on 24 January 2017.
