The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The names of the petitioners and respondents are mentioned along with the petition numbers. The names of the lawyers representing the petitioner(s) and respondent(s) are also provided.

One of the petitions was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking relief from a demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur. The notice demanded the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The petitioner had already deposited compensation for the diversion of forest land, but the mining department was required to deposit NPV under a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and concluded that the demand notice was illegal and quashed it. The court also ordered the refund of the amount deposited as NPV with interest.

Another petition pertained to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas used by other cluster members. The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed various documents related to the case.

The court order also pertained to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire area.

The court order also pertained to a dispute between mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, which included cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases, and therefore, segregation of these leases was not possible. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department.

In summary, the court order dealt with multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court quashed a demand notice for payment of NPV for the diversion of forest land for mining activities and ordered the refund of the amount deposited as NPV with interest. The court also reviewed a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department.
