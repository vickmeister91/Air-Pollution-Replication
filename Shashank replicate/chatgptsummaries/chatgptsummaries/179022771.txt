The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Jigish Shah and two others under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles 14, 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the FIR. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided that the matter requires further consideration, particularly in light of Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act and an order passed by the court in a related case.

The petitioners had sought the quashing of an FIR filed against them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Environment (Protection) Act. The FIR had been filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) alleging that the petitioners had violated various environmental norms while operating their chemical factory.

The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the matter required further consideration. The court observed that the case involved complex issues of law and fact, particularly in light of Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, which deals with the liability of persons in charge of a company for offences committed by the company.

The court also noted that a related case had been decided by the court earlier, which had a bearing on the present case. The court ordered the matter to be returnable in the last week of September 2012 and granted interim relief until the final hearing and disposal of the petition.

The court's decision to grant interim relief was based on the fact that the petitioners had made out a prima facie case for quashing the FIR. The court noted that the petitioners had submitted various documents to show that they had complied with all the environmental norms and regulations.

The court also observed that the GPCB had not conducted a proper investigation before filing the FIR. The court noted that the GPCB had relied on a report prepared by a private agency, which had not been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The court's decision to grant interim relief was also based on the fact that the petitioners had argued that the FIR had been filed with mala fide intentions. The petitioners had alleged that the GPCB had filed the FIR at the behest of their business rivals, who were trying to harass them.

The court noted that the allegations of mala fide were serious and required further investigation. The court observed that if the allegations were found to be true, it would be a clear case of abuse of process of law.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Jigish Shah and two others under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles 14, 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the FIR. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided that the matter requires further consideration, particularly in light of Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act and an order passed by the court in a related case. The court ordered the matter to be returnable in the last week of September 2012 and granted interim relief until the final hearing and disposal of the petition. The court's decision to grant interim relief was based on the fact that the petitioners had made out a prima facie case for quashing the FIR and that the allegations of mala fide were serious and required further investigation.
