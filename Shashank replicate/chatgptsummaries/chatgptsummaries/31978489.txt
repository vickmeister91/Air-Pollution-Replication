The Bombay High Court has issued a series of orders related to the proposed felling of trees in Mumbai's Aarey Colony for the construction of a metro car shed. The orders pertain to several petitions filed by different parties seeking to declare the area as a forest, eco-sensitive zone, or protected forest. The court has ordered a stay on the felling of trees and directed the Maharashtra government to not cut any more trees in Aarey Colony until further orders. The court has also directed the release of all those who were arrested for protesting against the felling of trees.

One of the petitions sought to declare the entire area of Aarey Colony as a 'Reserved Forest' or a 'Protected Forest' under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The court order provides a detailed background of the Aarey Colony and its history, including the acquisition of land in 1945 for a government dairy farm and the subsequent creation of a recreational zone. The court reserved its judgment on October 1, 2019, and declared its decision on October 4, 2019.

Another petition discussed the transfer of revenue land from Kavesar village and protected forest from Shimpoli and Borivli villages to the Borivali National Park in Thane and Bombay Suburban districts. The petitioners plead for the land in Aarey Colony to be declared as a reserved or protected forest based on reports and communications from government departments recognizing the area as a forest. The order also mentions a withdrawn application before the National Green Tribunal to declare Aarey as either a forest or an eco-sensitive zone.

The court also discussed a petition to declare Aarey Milk Colony as a reserved or protected forest or an eco-sensitive zone due to its proximity to the Mithi river and its function as a flood plain. The court notes that the definition of a forest is not clearly defined in Indian law and that the State of Maharashtra has not formulated any policy to determine the extent of land or tree coverage required to qualify as a forest. The issue of declaring Aarey Milk Colony as a forest or eco-sensitive zone is pending consideration before the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal.

The court order also pertains to the conversion of 33 hectares of land in Aarey Colony from a "No Development Zone" to a "Metro Car Depot/Workshop and allied uses". The petitioner had filed a case seeking a declaration of the entire Aarey Colony as a "Reserved forest" or a "Protected forest". The court clarified that the word "forest" must be understood according to its dictionary meaning and covers all statutorily recognized forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise. The petitioner had also sought an order to stop all construction work in Aarey Milk Colony until the final hearing of the case.

In another order, the court directed the National Green Tribunal to expeditiously decide on a case related to the eco-sensitive zone Notification and to decide on the instant petition irrespective of the observations made by the coordinate Bench of this Court. The court emphasizes that the appropriate forum to be approached is the Supreme Court concerning the issue of the area to be declared as a reserved forest or a protected forest and the report submitted by IIT Bombay and NEERI. The court dismisses the Writ Petition and the PIL without any order as to costs.

Overall, the Bombay High Court has issued several orders related to the proposed felling of trees in Aarey Colony, with different parties seeking to declare the area as a forest, eco-sensitive zone, or protected forest. The court has ordered a stay on the felling of trees and directed the Maharashtra government to not cut any more trees in Aarey Colony until further orders. The court has also directed the release of all those who were arrested for protesting against the felling of trees. The issue of declaring Aarey Colony as a forest or eco-sensitive zone is pending consideration before the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal.
