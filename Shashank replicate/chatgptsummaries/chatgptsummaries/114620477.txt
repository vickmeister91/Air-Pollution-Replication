Mahendra Pal had filed a petition to challenge the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Gharsana in Case No. 492/2004. The petitioner had applied under Section 91/311 Cr.P.C. to summon certain documents to prove his innocence. However, the trial court was only required to consider the documents submitted by the prosecution under Section 173 Cr.P.C. The court rejected the petitioner's application for summoning the documents under Section 91/311 Cr.P.C. and advised him to file the summoning application at the appropriate stage.

The petitioner had argued that the documents he wanted to summon were crucial to his defense and that the trial court should have allowed him to summon them. However, the court had rejected his argument and had stated that the documents submitted by the prosecution were sufficient for the trial court to consider.

The petitioner had then filed a petition challenging the order passed by the trial court. However, the petition was rejected by the court, and the stay petition was also rejected. The court had held that the trial court had not erred in rejecting the petitioner's application under Section 91/311 Cr.P.C. and that the petitioner could file the summoning application at the appropriate stage.

The court had also observed that the petitioner had not shown any exceptional circumstances that would warrant the summoning of the documents at this stage. The court had held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference in the order passed by the trial court.

In conclusion, the court had rejected the petitioner's petition challenging the order passed by the trial court. The court had held that the trial court had not erred in rejecting the petitioner's application under Section 91/311 Cr.P.C. and that the petitioner could file the summoning application at the appropriate stage.
