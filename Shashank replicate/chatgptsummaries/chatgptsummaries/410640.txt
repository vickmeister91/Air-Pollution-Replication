The court order in question pertains to eight civil writ petitions against the common orders of the Commissioner dated 19.2.2004. The case revolves around a petition filed by the Gram Panchayat under Section 7 of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 against the petitioners claiming that they are the unauthorized occupants of the land and deserve to be evicted. The petitioners, in their written statements, raised a counter claim that they were the owners of the property in dispute as per the revenue record and that the land in question was 'Burd Baramadgi' (subject to river action) and, therefore, came within the definition of Section 2(g) of the Act.

The court has remanded the case back to the Asstt. Collector to determine whether the land was subject to river action and as a result thereof whether the land came within the ambit of Section 2(g) or not. This decision is significant as it highlights the importance of determining the ownership of disputed land and the need to follow due process in such cases.

The Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 is a legislation that regulates the use and management of common lands in rural areas of Punjab. The Act defines common lands as any land in a village which is not owned by any person or which is owned jointly by the villagers. The Act also provides for the eviction of unauthorized occupants of common lands.

In this case, the Gram Panchayat had filed a petition under Section 7 of the Act against the petitioners claiming that they were unauthorized occupants of the land in question. The petitioners, on the other hand, claimed that they were the owners of the land as per the revenue record and that the land was subject to river action.

The concept of 'Burd Baramadgi' is significant in this case as it refers to land that is subject to river action. The Act defines 'Burd Baramadgi' as land that is subject to erosion or accretion due to the action of a river. Such land is considered to be common land and is regulated by the Act.

The court's decision to remand the case back to the Asstt. Collector to determine whether the land in question was subject to river action and whether it came within the ambit of Section 2(g) of the Act is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process in cases involving disputed land. The decision also underscores the need to determine the ownership of land before taking any action against unauthorized occupants.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to eight civil writ petitions against the common orders of the Commissioner dated 19.2.2004. The case revolves around a petition filed by the Gram Panchayat under Section 7 of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 against the petitioners claiming that they are the unauthorized occupants of the land and deserve to be evicted.
