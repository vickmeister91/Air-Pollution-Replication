The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Dipakbhai Parsurambhai Ghatrer and another individual in connection with a criminal case registered against them for offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately granted bail to the applicants, subject to certain conditions.

One of the key conditions of the bail was that the applicants would need to execute a personal bond. This is a legal document that essentially serves as a promise to the court that the individual will comply with all of the conditions of their bail. In this case, the bond likely included provisions related to the other conditions of the bail, such as not leaving the state of Gujarat without prior permission.

Speaking of which, another condition of the bail was that the applicants would need to obtain permission from the court before leaving the state of Gujarat. This is a common condition of bail, as it helps to ensure that the individual remains within the jurisdiction of the court and is available for any further legal proceedings that may be required.

It's worth noting that the court also warned the applicants that if any of the conditions of their bail were breached, appropriate action would be taken. This is a standard warning that is given in most bail orders, as it serves as a reminder to the individual that they are still subject to the authority of the court and must comply with all of the conditions of their bail.

Overall, this court order is fairly straightforward. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately granted bail to the applicants, subject to certain conditions. These conditions included executing a personal bond, obtaining permission from the court before leaving the state of Gujarat, and complying with any other conditions that may be imposed by the court. The court also warned the applicants that if any of these conditions were breached, appropriate action would be taken.
