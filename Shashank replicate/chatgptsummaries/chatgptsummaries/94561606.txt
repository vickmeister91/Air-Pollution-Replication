In a recent court order, the petitioner, Suraj Prakash Sharma, challenged an order passed by the Special Judge in 2008. The case pertained to a criminal matter, and the petitioner had objected to the direction of the trial court to produce a resolution register of Municipality, Bhinder. The petitioner had stated on oath that he did not have the register with him, and therefore, could not produce it.

The court considered the petitioner's objection and upheld the order to take a photocopy of the complaint filed by Manjoor Hussain. However, the court quashed the direction to produce the resolution register. The court reasoned that the petitioner had already stated on oath that he did not have the register with him, and therefore, it would be unfair to compel him to produce it.

The court also disposed of the stay petition and sent the record of the court below back. This means that the case will now proceed according to the court's order, and the parties involved will have to comply with the court's directions.

Overall, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that all parties are treated fairly. The court's decision to uphold the order to take a photocopy of the complaint filed by Manjoor Hussain while quashing the direction to produce the resolution register shows that the court is willing to consider the evidence presented before it and make decisions based on the facts of the case.

Furthermore, the court's decision to dispose of the stay petition and send the record of the court below back indicates that the court is committed to ensuring that cases are resolved in a timely and efficient manner. By disposing of the stay petition, the court has removed any obstacles that may have delayed the proceedings and allowed the case to move forward.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and ensuring that all parties are treated fairly. The court's decision to uphold the order to take a photocopy of the complaint filed by Manjoor Hussain while quashing the direction to produce the resolution register shows that the court is willing to consider the evidence presented before it and make decisions based on the facts of the case.
