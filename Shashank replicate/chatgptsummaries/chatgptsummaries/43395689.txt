The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner to set aside an order passed in Crl.M.P.No.2879 of 2012 in C.C.No.207 of 2012 dated 08.01.2013 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate cum Fast Track Court (Magistrate Level) at Kovilpatti. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 254(2) Cr.P.C., seeking to summon the Commercial Tax Officer, for examining him as a defence side witness for rebutting the contention of the respondent that there is a legally enforceable debt payable by the petitioner herein. However, the learned trial Judge dismissed the said application, leading to the filing of the Criminal Original Petition.

The petitioner's argument was that the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony was crucial to their defence, as it would help to establish that there was no legally enforceable debt payable by them. The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony was not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was merely trying to delay the proceedings.

The learned trial Judge, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, dismissed the petitioner's application. The petitioner then filed the Criminal Original Petition to set aside this order.

However, the Criminal Original Petition was dismissed, and the order passed by the learned trial Judge was upheld. The court held that the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony was not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was merely trying to delay the proceedings. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish how the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony would help to rebut the contention of the respondent that there was a legally enforceable debt payable by the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court upheld the order passed by the learned trial Judge and dismissed the Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner. The court held that the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony was not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was merely trying to delay the proceedings. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish how the Commercial Tax Officer's testimony would help to rebut the contention of the respondent that there was a legally enforceable debt payable by the petitioner.
