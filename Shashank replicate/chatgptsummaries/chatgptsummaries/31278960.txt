The court order discussed in this article pertains to a writ petition filed by M. Raja, a resident of Vedaranyam Taluk, Nagapattinam District, seeking a mandamus to direct the government to formulate a monitoring committee to supervise the desilting work of Vanaangadu Kottagam lake. The petitioner alleged irregularities in the desilting work and the use of JCB machines by the contractor instead of employing villagers under the Kudi Maramathu Scheme. However, the court rejected the petitioner's claims and stated that there is no statutory or constitutional right to seek a mandamus for the formation of a monitoring committee.

The court order emphasizes the importance of using public interest litigation with care and caution, ensuring that it is not used for personal gain or political motives. The court must be satisfied with the credentials and information provided by the applicant, and the information should show gravity and seriousness involved. The court must strike a balance between two conflicting interests and not allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations. The court should filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage the abuse of the process. The court should be careful in entertaining public interest litigations and reject applications of busybodies at the threshold. The jurisdiction of public interest litigation should be invoked sparingly and in favor of vigilant litigants, not for those who invoke it for the sake of publicity or private ends. The court should exercise this jurisdiction in rare cases involving public interest of a large number of people who cannot afford litigation and are made to suffer at the hands of the authorities.

The court order discusses the misuse of public interest litigation by individuals or organizations for personal gain or to settle professional rivalries. The court emphasizes that such litigation should only be used in rare cases involving the public interest of a large number of people who cannot afford litigation. The court also lays down guidelines for entertaining petitions filed in public interest, stating that the petitioner must genuinely come forward to espouse a public cause and not be guided by any ulterior motive or publicity gimmick. The court also emphasizes that a writ of mandamus cannot be issued merely because a person is praying for it, but one must establish the right first and then seek the prayer to enforce the said right.

The court order explains that a writ of mandamus can only be issued if the applicant can prove that they have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is sought. The court cites previous cases to explain the principles on which a writ of mandamus can be issued, including that it is not a writ of right and its issuance is largely controlled by equitable principles. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition but directs the District Collector to monitor the project periodically.

In summary, the court order discussed in this article highlights the importance of using public interest litigation with care and caution, ensuring that it is not used for personal gain or political motives.
