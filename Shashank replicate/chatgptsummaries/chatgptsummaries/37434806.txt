In a recent court order, a criminal revision petition filed by Sri Pradeep Gorpadu against Smt. Divya Pradeep was addressed. The petitioner had requested the court to set aside the orders passed under Section 91 of CR.P.C. However, the court allowed the petitioner to convert the revision petition into a criminal petition under Section 482 CR.P.C. and disposed of the petition for statistical purposes.

Section 91 of CR.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other material object that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, it appears that orders were passed under this section, which the petitioner sought to have set aside.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to convert the revision petition into a criminal petition under Section 482 CR.P.C. is significant. Section 482 CR.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of the court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. This section is often invoked in cases where there is no specific provision under the Code that can be relied upon.

By allowing the petitioner to convert the revision petition into a criminal petition under Section 482 CR.P.C., the court has essentially given the petitioner an opportunity to seek redressal for any alleged criminal wrongdoing on the part of Smt. Divya Pradeep. This is a significant development, as it suggests that the court is willing to consider the petitioner's claims seriously and take appropriate action if necessary.

It is worth noting that the court disposed of the petition for statistical purposes. This means that while the court has allowed the petitioner to convert the revision petition into a criminal petition, it has not yet taken any substantive action on the matter. It remains to be seen what further steps the court will take in this regard.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of Section 482 CR.P.C. in providing a mechanism for seeking redressal in cases where there is no specific provision under the Code that can be relied upon. It also suggests that the court is willing to consider claims of criminal wrongdoing seriously and take appropriate action if necessary. However, it is important to note that this is just one court order, and the outcome of this case will depend on the specific facts and circumstances involved.
