The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Vaseem Brick Field against the State of U.P. and three others. The petition was filed after the U.P. Pollution Control Board refused to grant consent to operate under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court ruled that the petitioner had a statutory remedy available under Section 31 of the Act and should have filed an appeal within 30 days of the order. The court dismissed the petition and allowed the petitioner to avail the remedy under the Act, and any appeal filed would be considered and decided by the Appellate Authority within three months.

The case involved M/S Vaseem Brick Field, which had applied for consent to operate under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The U.P. Pollution Control Board refused to grant consent to operate, citing violations of the Act and the rules made thereunder. The petitioner then filed a writ petition before the Allahabad High Court, seeking a direction to the Board to grant consent to operate.

The court observed that the petitioner had a statutory remedy available under Section 31 of the Act, which provides for an appeal to the Appellate Authority against an order of the Board. The court noted that the petitioner had not availed of this remedy and had instead filed a writ petition before the High Court. The court held that the petitioner should have filed an appeal within 30 days of the order, and since the petitioner had not done so, the writ petition was not maintainable.

The court further observed that the remedy under Section 31 was an effective and alternative remedy available to the petitioner. The court noted that the Appellate Authority was required to decide the appeal within three months of its filing, and any order passed by the Authority would be subject to further appeal before the National Green Tribunal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the Board on merits, and the court was not required to examine the same. The court held that the petitioner was free to challenge the order of the Board before the Appellate Authority, and any such challenge would be decided on its merits.

In light of the above, the court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to avail the remedy under Section 31 of the Act. The court directed that any appeal filed by the petitioner would be considered and decided by the Appellate Authority within three months of its filing.

The judgment of the Allahabad High Court highlights the importance of availing statutory remedies available under environmental laws. The court has emphasized that such remedies are effective and alternative remedies available to aggrieved parties, and should be availed of before approaching the courts. The judgment also underscores the need for strict compliance with the timelines prescribed under the law, failing which the remedy may become time-barred.
