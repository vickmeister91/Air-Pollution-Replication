The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Pushpa Devi against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent pollution and remove encroachments. The state was also directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating distributory or canal water and to make citizens aware of this through publication of notices. The court also requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records of a related case. The order was followed up with further directions to remove encroachments and issue show cause notices for compensation to those causing pollution. The State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued several orders directing the State Government of Rajasthan to remove encroachments from the Indira Gandhi Canal and to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to the pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000 from them. However, the State Government failed to comply with the orders, and the NGT had to repeatedly direct them to take action. The NGT also directed the District Collector of Ganganagar to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and records relevant to the proceedings. The NGT has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to substantial questions relating to the environment, and persons aggrieved with the State Government's actions were directed to approach the NGT.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The court emphasizes the importance of fundamental and constitutional rights and the discretion given to High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue writs, orders, and directions to protect these rights. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching a writ court, but notes that this principle can be deviated from in certain circumstances. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner(s) to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court order states that individuals can file an application or representation by December 31, 2016, and until then, the state authorities cannot take any action against them. The court believes that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has the power to condone any delay in the application process and hopes that the NGT will consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. The NGT is requested to sympathetically consider the applications filed by the petitioners. After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed according to further orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition is disposed of.
