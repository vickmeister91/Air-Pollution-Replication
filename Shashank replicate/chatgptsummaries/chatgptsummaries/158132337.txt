The court order pertains to four different cases related to the management of tigers in India. The first case, Civil Application No. 1624/2018 and Writ Petition No. 5792/2018, involves a challenge to an order issued by the respondent no. 2 under Section 11(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 permitting the shoot at sight of a tigress named T-1 and the capture of her two cubs. The petitioners argue that the respondents had more than seven months to tranquilize or capture the tigress and the order is unsustainable. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The second case discusses a petition regarding the guidelines for declaring big cats as 'man-eaters'. The guidelines require the constitution of a team for technical guidance and monitoring, setting up of camera traps and pug mark impression pads, and cautioning inhabitants in the area. The court discusses three incidents of tiger attacks and the measures taken by the field monitoring team. The Chief Wildlife Warden has identified the tigress and cubs sighted in Compartment No. 155 as the ones involved in the human killing. The order also mentions the collection of animal hair samples and swabs from puncture wounds for identifying the animal.

The third case involves a committee's investigation into three incidents of human killings by a tigress named T-1. The committee concluded that T-1 was responsible for all three killings and declared her a man-eater. The Chief Wildlife Warden ordered for T-1 to be tranquilized and captured, but if unsuccessful, to be eliminated by shooting to prevent further loss of human life. The court found no dispute with the material looked into and the bonafides of the Chief Wildlife Warden, but the contention was that other steps/measures stipulated in the SOP ought to have been considered. The court ultimately upheld the Chief Wildlife Warden's decision.

The fourth case discusses the steps to be taken after the loss of human life due to a problem tiger. The order states that various possibilities have been enumerated, but the measures are not exhaustive. The Chief Wildlife Warden's subjective satisfaction is important in determining the presence of a problem tiger. The court finds no jurisdictional error or perversity in the order and dismisses the writ petition and civil application. The request to maintain status quo for a further period of seven days is rejected.

In the first case, the court is yet to deliver its judgment. The petitioners argue that the respondents had more than seven months to tranquilize or capture the tigress and the order is unsustainable. The respondents, on the other hand, argue that the tigress was declared a man-eater after she killed three people and that the shoot at sight order was necessary to prevent further loss of human life. The court has reserved its judgment and is yet to deliver its verdict.

In the second case, the court discusses the guidelines for declaring big cats as 'man-eaters'. The guidelines require the constitution of a team for technical guidance and monitoring, setting up of camera traps and pug mark impression pads, and cautioning inhabitants in the area. The court also discusses three incidents of tiger attacks and the measures taken by the field monitoring team. The Chief Wildlife Warden has identified the tigress and cubs sighted in Compartment No. 155 as the ones involved in the human killing. The order also mentions the collection of animal hair samples and swabs from puncture wounds for identifying the animal.

In the third case, the court upholds the Chief Wildlife Warden's decision to tranquilize and capture or eliminate the problem tigress T-1. The committee investigating the three incidents of human killings concluded that T-1 was responsible for all three killings and declared her a man-eater. The Chief Wildlife Warden ordered for T-1 to be tranquilized and captured, but if unsuccessful, to be eliminated by shooting to prevent further loss of human life. The court found no dispute with the material looked into and the bonafides of the Chief Wildlife Warden, but the contention was that other steps/measures stipulated in the SOP ought to have been considered. The court ultimately upheld the Chief Wildlife Warden's decision.

In the fourth case, the court discusses the steps to be taken after the loss of human life due to a problem tiger. The order states that various possibilities have been enumerated, but the measures are not exhaustive. The Chief Wildlife Warden's subjective satisfaction is important in determining the presence of a problem tiger. The court finds no jurisdictional error or perversity in the order and dismisses the writ petition and civil application. The request to maintain status quo for a further period of seven days is rejected.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to four different cases related to the management of tigers in India. The court is yet to deliver its judgment in the first case, while it upholds the Chief Wildlife Warden's decision in the second and third cases. The court finds no jurisdictional error or perversity in the order in the fourth case and dismisses the writ petition and civil application. The court emphasizes the importance of following the guidelines for declaring big cats as 'man-eaters' and taking necessary steps to prevent further loss of human life.
