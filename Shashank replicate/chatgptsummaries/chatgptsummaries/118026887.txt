The court order pertains to two petitioners who are facing the possibility of arrest in connection with a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Wild Life Protection Act, and Indian Forest Act. The petitioners have sought bail, claiming innocence and false implication. The court has directed them to surrender within five weeks and, upon surrender, be released on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 20,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court has also imposed a cost of Rs. 6,000 each to be deposited on the date of surrender, subject to the result of the case.

The case in question involves allegations of violations of various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Wild Life Protection Act, and Indian Forest Act. The petitioners have been accused of committing these violations and are facing the possibility of arrest. In response, they have sought bail, claiming that they are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case.

The court has considered the petitioners' request for bail and has directed them to surrender within five weeks. Upon surrender, they will be released on bail on the condition that they furnish a bail bond of Rs. 20,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. This means that the petitioners will need to provide a sum of money as security for their release, and they will also need to find two people who are willing to act as sureties and provide the same amount of money as security.

In addition to these conditions, the court has also imposed a cost of Rs. 6,000 each to be deposited on the date of surrender. This cost is subject to the result of the case, meaning that if the petitioners are found guilty, they will need to pay this amount as a penalty. However, if they are found innocent, they will not need to pay this amount.

Overall, the court order provides a clear direction for the petitioners in this case. They are required to surrender within five weeks and will be released on bail upon doing so. However, they will need to provide a bail bond and find two sureties, and they will also need to pay a cost of Rs. 6,000 each. The outcome of the case will determine whether or not they will need to pay this cost as a penalty.
