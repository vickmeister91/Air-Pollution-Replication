The court has granted bail to Rajbeer Singh, who was arrested on 5/8/2017 in connection with a wildlife protection act and arms act case. Singh's counsel argued that he was only implicated based on the memorandum of a co-accused and that nothing was recovered from him. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety to secure his presence during trial.

Rajbeer Singh was arrested on 5/8/2017 in connection with a wildlife protection act and arms act case. He was accused of being involved in illegal wildlife trade and possessing illegal arms. Singh's counsel argued that he was only implicated based on the memorandum of a co-accused and that nothing was recovered from him. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety to secure his presence during trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rajbeer Singh has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the decision, arguing that Singh has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in any illegal activity. Others, however, have expressed concern that Singh's release could jeopardize the ongoing investigation into the case.

Singh's counsel argued that he was only implicated based on the memorandum of a co-accused and that nothing was recovered from him. This suggests that Singh may have been falsely implicated in the case. However, it is important to note that the court did not comment on the merits of the case when granting bail to Singh. This means that the court did not make a determination as to whether or not Singh was actually involved in any illegal activity.

The court ordered Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety to secure his presence during trial. This is a standard requirement for bail in criminal cases. The purpose of the bond is to ensure that the accused appears in court for all hearings and does not flee the jurisdiction.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Rajbeer Singh is a significant development in the case. It remains to be seen how the investigation will proceed now that Singh has been released on bail. It is possible that new evidence may come to light that could implicate Singh further in the case. Alternatively, it is possible that Singh may be exonerated of all charges. Only time will tell how this case will ultimately be resolved.
