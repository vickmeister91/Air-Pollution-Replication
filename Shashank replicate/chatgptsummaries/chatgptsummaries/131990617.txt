The Allahabad High Court recently heard two writ petitions related to the supply of textbooks to Basic Schools in Uttar Pradesh. The challenge was to the alteration in the policy for the current year's supply of textbooks in 2016-17 under the Government Order dated 17.2.2016 and the consequential tender notice together with the proceedings that have been undertaken therein dated 17.4.2016. The court allowed the state government to finalize any negotiations in terms of the policy dated 17.2.2016 only after ascertaining whether virgin pulp paper is an alternate or optional standard admissible under Bureau of Indian Standards mark or not. The court dismissed one of the writ petitions with liberty to challenge and raise the dispute in appropriate proceedings at an appropriate stage.

The court order pertains to a challenge against the policy of the State Government, which requires textbooks to be printed on paper made from virgin pulp, bamboo, or wood-based materials. The petitioners argue that this policy violates the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and is discriminatory, while the State argues that the policy is environment-friendly and does not violate any laws or constitutional policies. The court rejects the petitioners' arguments and upholds the State's policy, stating that the State has the right to choose a particular quality of paper and that the petitioners have failed to establish that the choice is harmful to the environment or violates any laws. The court also notes that the notification dated 9.11.1992 is not a notification under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act but rather a direction exercised by the Central Government.

The court order discusses a dispute over the use of raw materials for manufacturing paper to be used for printing textbooks for students. The state government's policy permits the use of printing paper made of virgin pulp based on bamboo and softwood, which the petitioners argue is not environmentally friendly. The court analyzes the issue in the light of the Bureau of Indian Standards Act and concludes that Indian standard articles must conform to specific requirements for the standard mark, which indicates a specific quality permissible under the Act. The court finds that the use of virgin pulp of the prescribed description in the impugned government order is user-friendly and does not defeat the environment-friendly policy. The court also discusses the resolution and notification related to eco-mark and concludes that the notification was in two parts, one indicating the general requirements of Indian Standards products, and the second providing for specific requirements of eco-mark.

The court order discusses a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1992, which established criteria for labeling paper as environment-friendly. The notification included general requirements for Indian Standards products and specific requirements for eco-mark products. The Bureau of Indian Standards was given the power to formulate optional standards for environment-friendly characteristics. The court concludes that the notification has a binding effect and that the provision for eco-mark is an additional requirement for a specific quality of paper. The court also discusses the use of Virgin Pulp based on Bamboo and wood for printing, which the State Government has prescribed in a policy. The court finds that the policy is not contrary to the notification and that the State Government has the authority to prescribe the quality of paper for textbooks. The court directs the State Government to ensure that the prescribed quality of paper is not injurious or hazardous to the health of students.

The court order states that the State Government must ensure that the paper used for textbooks is not injurious or hazardous to the health of infants or the environment. The petitioners failed to prove that the paper prescribed in the policy is not eco-friendly. The State Government cannot give any leverage to printers and publishers for procurement of any paper that may endanger the environment or life. The choice of raw material for paper manufacturing by the State Government cannot be said to be arbitrary unless it violates any provisions of law. The possession of eco-mark is not necessary for being environment friendly. The court is not inclined to strike down the policy but the State Government must ensure environment-friendly utilization of paper. The writ petitions are dismissed with observations.

In summary, the Allahabad High Court heard two writ petitions related to the supply of textbooks to Basic Schools in Uttar Pradesh. The court allowed the state government to finalize any negotiations in terms of the policy dated 17.2.2016 only after ascertaining whether virgin pulp paper is an alternate or optional standard admissible under Bureau of Indian Standards mark or not. The court dismissed one of the writ petitions with liberty to challenge and raise the dispute in appropriate proceedings at an appropriate stage. The court rejected the petitioners' arguments and upheld the State's policy, stating that the State has the right to choose a particular quality of paper and that the petitioners have failed to establish that the choice is harmful to the environment or violates any laws. The court directed the State Government to ensure that the prescribed quality of paper is not injurious or hazardous to the health of students and that the State Government must ensure environment-friendly utilization of paper. The writ petitions were dismissed with observations.
