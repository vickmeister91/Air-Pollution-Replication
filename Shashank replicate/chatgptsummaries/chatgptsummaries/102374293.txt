In a recent court order, the first application for bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was denied on behalf of the petitioners Deepchand, Subhash, and Sukhchand in POR No.38/44 registered by Uttar Van Mandal (Samanya), District- Betul under Sections 9, 39, 44, 50, 51-A of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioners were accused of conspiring to kill a tiger and were linked to the crime. 

The court deemed the offence serious and the investigation was still ongoing, therefore the petitioners were not released on bail. The court stated that the offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a non-bailable offence and the petitioners were not entitled to bail as a matter of right. The court also noted that the investigation was still in progress and the petitioners were likely to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses if released on bail. 

The court further observed that the petitioners had not made out a case for bail on the grounds of parity as the co-accused who were granted bail were not similarly situated. The court also noted that the petitioners had not shown any exceptional circumstances to warrant their release on bail. 

The court, however, granted the petitioners the liberty to renew their prayer for bail at a later stage of the case. The court also directed the trial court to expedite the trial and complete it within a period of six months from the date of the order.
