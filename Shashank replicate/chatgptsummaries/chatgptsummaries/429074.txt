The court order in question pertains to two connected criminal revisions against similar orders. The case involves a complaint under the Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, 1974, where two accused public servants sought dismissal of the complaint against them for want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate accepted their application and discharged them for want of sanction. However, the court found no merit in the revisions and dismissed them.

The Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, 1974, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, as well as for the appointment of officers to enforce its provisions. The Act also lays down penalties for violations of its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

In the case at hand, two public servants were accused of violating the provisions of the Act. They sought dismissal of the complaint against them on the grounds that no sanction had been obtained under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 197 provides that no court can take cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant in the discharge of his official duties without the prior sanction of the government.

The learned Magistrate accepted the application of the accused and discharged them for want of sanction. However, the court found no merit in the revisions and dismissed them. The court held that the provisions of Section 197 were not applicable in the present case, as the accused were not acting in the discharge of their official duties when they committed the alleged offence. The court also noted that the accused had not produced any evidence to show that they had obtained the necessary sanction under Section 197.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, 1974, and the need to enforce its provisions. The Act is an important tool in the fight against water pollution in India, and its effective implementation is essential to protect the health and well-being of the people.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before initiating criminal proceedings against public servants. This provision is intended to protect public servants from frivolous and vexatious litigation, and its proper application is essential to ensure that public servants can discharge their official duties without fear of harassment or persecution.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the fight against water pollution in India. The court's reaffirmation of the importance of the Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, 1974, and its decision to dismiss the revisions against the accused public servants for want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sends a strong message that violations of the Act will not be tolerated. It also underscores the need to ensure that public servants are protected from frivolous and vexatious litigation, while at the same time ensuring that they are held accountable for any violations of the law.
