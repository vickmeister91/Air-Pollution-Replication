The case in question involves three individuals who were found in possession of cooked meat of a wild pig, which is a schedule 3, serial No. 119 animal under the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused had been in jail since June 28/30, 2015, and had filed bail applications under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. The court considered the facts and circumstances of the case, the punishment prescribed for the offense, and the substantial investigation already conducted before allowing their release on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the nature of the offense and the punishment prescribed for it. The possession of meat from a protected animal is a serious offense, but the punishment prescribed for it is not severe. This suggests that the offense is not considered to be as serious as other crimes, such as murder or rape.

Secondly, the court considered the facts and circumstances of the case. The accused had been in jail for a considerable period of time, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were a flight risk or a danger to society. Additionally, the court noted that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had not attempted to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

Finally, the court considered the substantial investigation already conducted in the case. The accused had been in jail for several months, and during this time, the investigation had progressed significantly. The court noted that there was no reason to believe that the accused would interfere with the investigation or obstruct justice.

Based on these factors, the court allowed the accused to be released on bail. However, the court also directed the accused to appear before the trial court on each date given to them until the disposal of the trial. This ensures that the accused will be present for the trial and will not attempt to evade justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the accused in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the punishment prescribed for the offense, and the substantial investigation already conducted. While the offense is serious, the court determined that the accused were not a flight risk or a danger to society, and that there was no reason to believe that they would interfere with the investigation or obstruct justice. The court's decision to require the accused to appear before the trial court on each date given to them until the disposal of the trial ensures that justice will be served in this case.
