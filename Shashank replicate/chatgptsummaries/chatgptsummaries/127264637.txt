The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case in which the Accountant General of Madhya Pradesh appealed a judgment and order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The case concerned the entitlement of a former judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court to pension for his service as President of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The appellant argued that there was no provision for pension under the relevant laws and rules, while the respondent claimed that he was entitled to pension based on orders issued by the State Government. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondent.

The court order states that the State Government must frame and ratify rules for the payment of pension to the President of the State Commission, as there is no statutory provision for it. The High Court had allowed a writ petition filed by the respondent, directing the appellant to finalize and make payment of pension and other dues. The appellant appealed this decision, arguing that there was no provision for pension in the State Rules. The respondent argued that the executive can fill gaps in the rules by issuing executive orders. The court considered a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeal, but ultimately decided to address the important question of the State Government's power to make the service rendered by the respondent pensionable by an executive order despite the existence of State Rules.

The court order discusses the entitlement of pension benefits to the respondent, who served as President of the State Commission. The court refers to a previous case and concludes that the respondent is only entitled to pension as a High Court Judge and not for his subsequent service as President. The State Government had issued an order stating that the respondent's service as President was pensionable, but the court notes that the State Rules do not provide for this. The court examines the relevant provisions of the 1986 Act and concludes that the respondent is not entitled to pension for his service as President.

The court order defines the term "member" as including the President and a member of the National Commission or a State Commission or a District Forum. It also explains that the word "prescribed" in the 1986 Act means prescribed by rules made by the State Government or the Central Government. The order discusses Section 30, which deals with the power of the State Government to make rules, and Section 31, which requires rules and regulations made under the Act to be laid before each House of Parliament. The order then provides details of Rule 6 of the State Rules, which outlines the salary, allowances, and terms and conditions of the President and Members of the State Commission. It includes provisions for removal from office and filling vacancies.

The court order discusses the issue of whether the service of the President and Members of the State Commission is a pensionable service. The State Rules do not make any provision for this, but an Executive order dated April 5, 2002 provided that the service rendered by the respondent as President of the State Commission would be counted as pensionable service. The court determines that the executive power of the State Executive is coextensive with that of the State Legislature, and that executive instructions can fill in gaps not covered by rules but cannot be in derogation of the statutory rules. The court also interprets the expression "as may be prescribed" in Section 16(2) to mean "if any," and that the provision does not make pension a condition of service.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the phrase "as may be prescribed" in a provision under the law, stating that it allows for some flexibility and may have different meanings depending on the context. The order also clarifies that the power of the State Government to issue executive orders or administrative instructions is not limited by the absence of rules on a particular subject, as long as such orders are not inconsistent with constitutional or statutory provisions. The court ultimately upholds the entitlement of the respondent to pension from the State Government based on an executive order issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh.

The court order dismisses a civil appeal regarding the entitlement of pension for a retired High Court Judge who served as the President of the State Commission. The order states that the pension for the service as President will be provided as per the order dated April 5, 2002, and will not be clubbed with the service as a High Court Judge. The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.

The court order pertains to the pension and gratuity of a former High Court Judge who served as the President of the M.P. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The appellant raised objections to the calculation of the pension and sought clarification on certain points. The case was challenged in the High Court, which allowed the additional liability being undertaken by the State Government. The appellant, who is in charge of the accounts in the State and represents the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, is eligible to challenge the decision. The principal submission on behalf of the appellant is based on Section 16(2) of the Act, which lays down the power of the Central Government or that of the State Government to make rules.

The court order states that the State Government can make rules for carrying out the provisions of Section 16(2) of the Act, which includes the terms and conditions of service for members of the State Commission. However, the rules do not provide for pension or other benefits. If the State Government wants to grant pension, it must do so by framing additional rules. The court also notes
