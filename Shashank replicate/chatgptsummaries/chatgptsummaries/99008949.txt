The court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed by Ms. Sunita Mittal against Dilip Kumar for dishonoring postdated cheques issued for repayment of a loan. The accused claimed to have made the payment towards the entire loan amount and pleaded not guilty. The case was put up for further cross-examination on 28.8.2014.

During the cross-examination, the court ordered the complainant to supply copies of her Income Tax Returns for the period 2005-2006 to 2011-2012 to the accused's counsel for further cross-examination. The accused argued that the complainant cannot challenge this order in a higher court as it is an interlocutory order. However, the court disagreed and stated that the order to produce documents is of importance and can be challenged in a higher court.

The court emphasized the importance of cross-examination but warned against irrelevant or harassing questions. The court further stated that the complainant was wrongly directed to produce income tax returns and that the accused has not provided details of repayment in cross-examination.

The court order sets aside the trial court's order to produce income tax returns and allows only relevant questions related to the repayment of the loan by the accused during cross-examination. The accused is not allowed to ask irrelevant questions. The court also suggests that if an accused wants a witness to come to court with certain documents, they should move an application under Section 91 CrPC much in advance.

The court found a flagrant violation of the principles of Indian Evidence Act by the accused and passed appropriate directions. The revision petition is disposed of accordingly.
