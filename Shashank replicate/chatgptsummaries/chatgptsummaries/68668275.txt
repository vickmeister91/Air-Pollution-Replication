The Seoni district court recently granted bail to Laxman Gond, who was accused of killing a wild boar in a forest under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court considered several factors before granting bail, including the fact that the charge sheet had been filed, the applicant was a permanent resident of Seoni district, and did not have any criminal antecedents except for the present case.

The court also ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount and to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section lays down the conditions for granting bail, including that the accused shall not commit any offence while on bail, shall make himself available for trial, and shall not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The case against Laxman Gond was filed under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act lays down strict penalties for offences such as hunting, poaching, and killing of wild animals.

In this case, Laxman Gond was accused of killing a wild boar in a forest in Seoni district. The act of killing a wild animal is a serious offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and can attract imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees or with both.

However, the court considered several mitigating factors before granting bail to the accused. The fact that the charge sheet had been filed indicated that the investigation was complete and that there was no risk of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses. The fact that the accused was a permanent resident of Seoni district also indicated that he was not a flight risk and was likely to appear for trial.

Moreover, the court noted that the accused did not have any criminal antecedents except for the present case. This indicated that the accused was not a habitual offender and was unlikely to commit any offence while on bail. The court also took into account the fact that the offence in question was not a heinous crime and did not involve any violence against humans.

In light of these factors, the court granted bail to the accused on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount and abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This decision reflects the court's careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and its commitment to ensuring that justice is served in a fair and impartial manner.
