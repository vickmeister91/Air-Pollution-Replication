The Supreme Court of India has issued a court order pertaining to multiple cases involving stone crushing companies in Haryana, India. The companies had established their stone crushers in the 1970s and 1980s, but were found to be causing air pollution and environmental degradation. The Supreme Court issued directions in 1992 to stop the operation of stone crushers in certain areas, and to provide a new "Crushing Zone" for the affected companies. The government of Haryana later notified new siting parameters in 1997, and identified new zones for the stone crushers to relocate.

The court order discusses the petitioners' requests for plot allotment in the new crushing zone, and the government's response. The petitioners had requested that they be allotted plots in the new crushing zone, as they had been operating their stone crushers in the area for many years. The government had initially refused to allot plots to the petitioners, stating that they did not meet the new siting parameters. However, the court order directs the government to allot plots to the petitioners within three months.

The court order also pertains to the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1988 regarding the siting parameters for stone crushing units. The court order clarifies that existing stone crushing units in Haryana that do not meet the specified parameters must either shift to a new site or close down. The order also discusses the priority given to stone crushing units that were ordered to be closed down or shifted under judicial orders.

The court quashes a clause in an advertisement that requires an interview for allotment of stone crushing sites, stating that it is an empty formality and an exercise in futility. The court directs the respondents to allot plots to the petitioners within three months. The court order also directs the government to take necessary steps to ensure that the stone crushing units in Haryana comply with the specified siting parameters.

The court order is significant as it addresses the issue of air pollution and environmental degradation caused by stone crushing units in Haryana. The court has directed the government to take necessary steps to ensure that the stone crushing units comply with the specified siting parameters, and has also directed the government to allot plots to the petitioners within three months. The court order is expected to have a significant impact on the stone crushing industry in Haryana, and is likely to lead to a reduction in air pollution and environmental degradation caused by stone crushing units.
