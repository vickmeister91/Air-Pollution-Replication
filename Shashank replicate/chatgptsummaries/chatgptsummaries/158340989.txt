The Indian courts have recently issued several orders related to disputes over the bidding process for various infrastructure projects. These orders pertain to writ petitions filed by companies challenging the rejection of their bids for projects related to the installation of an Advanced Traffic Management System and Toll Management System, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) project for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and a toll collection project.

In the first case, two writ petitions were filed challenging the rejection of tenders submitted by Efkon India Private Limited and Strabag AG Consortium, and IBI Group UK Ltd and IBI Group Consortium, in response to the invitation to bid issued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The petitioners argued that NHAI's rejection of their bids was arbitrary and lacked transparency, and that NHAI violated tender conditions by opening financial bids immediately after evaluating technical bids without providing reasons for disqualification. The court was tasked with deciding on the legality of NHAI's actions.

In the second case, the court discussed a dispute over the bidding process for the ITS project for the EPE. The petitioner, M/s Efkon India Pvt. Ltd., challenged the rejection of its bid and alleged violations of tender requirements. The NHAI argued that the bidding process was fair and objective, and that the rejection of the petitioner's bid was based on non-compliance with the prescribed criteria. The court rejected the petitioner's claims and upheld the NHAI's decision.

In the third case, two petitions were filed by Efkon and IDI regarding the rejection of their bids for a toll collection project. Both petitions argued that the rejection was illegal and unreasoned. The court reviewed the evaluation report and found that the rejection was based on objective criteria and was fair. The court also stated that judicial review of tender conditions is limited to procedural regularity and legality, and not the merits of the decision. The court ultimately dismissed both petitions.

In the fourth case, the court stated that courts should defer to executive decisions unless there is evidence of manifest mala fides or procedural irregularity or illegality. The court cannot decide whether differences in tendered works and systems operationalized by a bidder are major or minor, and procedural irregularities are not substantial enough to result in tender rejection. The rejection of the petitioners' bids was not arbitrary, procedurally unfair, illegal, or lacking in bona fides. The writ petitions were dismissed without order on costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following tender requirements and procedures in infrastructure projects. The courts have emphasized the need for transparency and fairness in the bidding process, while also recognizing the limited scope of judicial review in such matters. Companies bidding for infrastructure projects must ensure that they comply with all tender requirements and criteria to avoid rejection of their bids.
