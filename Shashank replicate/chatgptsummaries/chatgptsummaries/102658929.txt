Mrs. Divya G. Fernandes filed a criminal petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the IV M.M.T.C., Bangalore in Crl. Misc. Petn. No.70/2011 and allow the application filed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner sought to summon documents such as bank statements, income tax returns, and account ledgers to establish the annual income of the respondent during the period when she was living with him and for the subsequent period, for the purpose of proper decision on the question of quantum of maintenance.

The learned Magistrate rejected the said application, but the petitioner filed another application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C seeking summoning of the documents mentioned in the earlier application from the income-tax authorities as well as the bank authorities. The learned Magistrate rejected the said application, but the respondent had no serious objections to summoning the documents.

The petitioner then filed a criminal petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Karnataka, seeking to set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate and allow the application filed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court observed that the learned Magistrate had not given any reasons for rejecting the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and that the respondent had no serious objections to summoning the documents. The High Court further observed that the documents sought to be summoned were relevant for the purpose of deciding the question of quantum of maintenance.

The High Court, therefore, allowed the petition and directed the learned Magistrate to issue summons to the persons mentioned therein to produce the documents enumerated therein. The High Court also directed the learned Magistrate to decide the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. on its merits, after considering the documents produced.

In another case, the petitioner, who was the wife of the respondent, filed a petition under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking maintenance for herself and her minor daughter. The respondent, who was the husband of the petitioner, contested the petition on the ground that the petitioner was earning sufficient income and was not entitled to maintenance.

The learned Magistrate, after considering the evidence on record, held that the petitioner was entitled to maintenance and awarded a sum of Rs. 5,000 per month to the petitioner and Rs. 3,000 per month to the minor daughter. The respondent filed a revision petition before the Sessions Court, challenging the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

The Sessions Court, after considering the evidence on record, held that the petitioner was not entitled to maintenance as she was earning sufficient income. The Sessions Court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate and dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner.

The petitioner then filed a criminal petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Karnataka, challenging the order passed by the Sessions Court. The High Court observed that the Sessions Court had not considered the evidence on record in its proper perspective and had not given any reasons for holding that the petitioner was not entitled to maintenance.

The High Court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the Sessions Court and restored the order passed by the learned Magistrate. The High Court also directed the respondent to pay the arrears of maintenance to the petitioner and the minor daughter.

In yet another case, the petitioner, who was the wife of the respondent, filed a petition under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking maintenance for herself and her minor daughter. The respondent, who was the husband of the petitioner, contested the petition on the ground that the petitioner was living separately from him without any reasonable cause and was, therefore, not entitled to maintenance.

The learned Magistrate, after considering the evidence on record, held that the petitioner was entitled to maintenance and awarded a sum of Rs. 4,000 per month to the petitioner and Rs. 2,000 per month to the minor daughter. The respondent filed a revision petition before the Sessions Court, challenging the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

The Sessions Court, after considering the evidence on record, held that the petitioner was not entitled to maintenance as she was living separately from the respondent without any reasonable cause. The Sessions Court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate and dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner.

The petitioner then filed a criminal petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Karnataka, challenging the order passed by the Sessions Court. The High Court observed that the Sessions Court had not considered the evidence on record in its proper perspective and had not given any reasons for holding that the petitioner was not entitled to maintenance.

The High Court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the Sessions Court and restored the order passed by the learned Magistrate. The High Court also directed the respondent to pay the arrears of maintenance to the petitioner and the minor daughter.

In conclusion, these cases highlight the importance of proper consideration of evidence on record and giving reasons for the decisions taken by the courts. The courts have a duty to ensure that justice is done to all parties and that the rights of the weaker sections of society are protected. The courts must also ensure that the provisions of the law are not misused or abused by any party.
