The Madras High Court recently received two writ petitions filed by S. Dharmaraj and A. Mohamed Saleem against the Government of Tamil Nadu, requesting a comprehensive investigation into the alleged abuse of power by a public officer. The officer in question was accused of nepotism, misuse/abuse of authority, and disproportionate wealth. The officer had previously been cleared of similar allegations in an independent inquiry, which the petitioners claimed was farcical. The court received counters from the officer and the government, which stated that the officer had voluntarily provided information regarding his income and that the previous inquiry had found no basis for the allegations. The court did not sit in appeal over the inquiry report and noted that the maintainability of the writ petitions was in doubt.

The court order pertains to a public interest litigation against an officer regarding allegations of financial impropriety and corruption. The court dismisses the petition, stating that it cannot sit in appeal over the enquiry report and that there is no public interest involved. The court imposes costs on the petitioners and dismisses the writ petitions. The court also cites previous judgments and directions from the Supreme Court regarding the need to preserve the purity and sanctity of public interest litigation and discourage frivolous petitions.
