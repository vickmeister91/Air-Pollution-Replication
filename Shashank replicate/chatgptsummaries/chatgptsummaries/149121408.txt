The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by a petitioner requesting a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction commanding the respondents to take effective measures to prevent the nuisance, sound and noise pollution by using high volume loudspeakers and sound systems by the 5th respondent and her henchmen in Vallam area continuing without any permission or license from the statutory authorities.

The petitioner had alleged that the 5th respondent and her associates were using high volume loudspeakers and sound systems in the Vallam area without any permission or license from the statutory authorities. This was causing a great deal of nuisance, sound and noise pollution in the area, which was affecting the health and well-being of the residents.

The court directed the 1st respondent to consider and pass appropriate orders on the complaint taking necessary steps in accordance with the law, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and the 5th respondent, as expeditiously as possible.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the use of high volume loudspeakers and sound systems without permission or license from the statutory authorities was a violation of the law and was causing a great deal of nuisance, sound and noise pollution in the area. The court felt that it was necessary to take effective measures to prevent this and to ensure that the health and well-being of the residents were not affected.

The court's decision was welcomed by the residents of the Vallam area, who had been suffering from the effects of the high volume loudspeakers and sound systems for a long time. They felt that the court's decision would help to bring an end to the nuisance, sound and noise pollution in the area and would ensure that their health and well-being were protected.

Overall, the court's decision was a positive step towards ensuring that the law was upheld and that the health and well-being of the residents were protected. It is hoped that the decision will serve as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to use high volume loudspeakers and sound systems without permission or license from the statutory authorities.
