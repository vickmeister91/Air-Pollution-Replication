The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. It also lays down penalties for offenses related to wildlife, such as hunting, poaching, and trafficking.

In this case, Asin Ali was found in possession of a female elephant without any permit or license from the concerned authority.

Section 40(1) of the Act prohibits the hunting of wild animals, while section 40(2) prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal or its parts without a valid permit. Section 43(2) provides for the punishment for offenses under the Act, which includes imprisonment for a term of up to three years, or a fine of up to Rs. 25,000, or both.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Asin Ali had transported the elephant without any permit or license and had failed to inform the concerned authorities. The defense argued that Asin Ali had purchased the elephant from a legitimate source and was not aware of the legal requirements for transporting it.
