The Indian judiciary has been actively involved in addressing the issue of vehicular pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. In recent years, several court orders have been issued to regulate the use of vehicles in the region and to improve air quality. This article summarizes three court orders that pertain to the interpretation of notifications issued by the Central Government to control vehicular pollution in the NCR.

The first court order pertains to a case between Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Sunil Bansal & Others. The case involves the interpretation of a notification issued by the Central Government in 2004, which prescribed mass emission standards for four-wheeled vehicles. The notification was issued under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and was aimed at reducing vehicular pollution in the country. The notification prescribed different emission standards for different categories of vehicles, based on their weight and fuel type.

The case before the court was related to the eligibility criteria for trucks offered by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited for transportation of LPG cylinders within the NCR. The eligibility criteria required that the trucks comply with the mass emission standards prescribed by the Central Government. The petitioners in the case challenged the eligibility criteria, arguing that they were arbitrary and discriminatory.

The court, however, upheld the eligibility criteria and directed that the committee's recommendations be strictly adhered to. The court approved the directions given by the Bhure Lal Committee to tackle the problem of vehicular pollution. The committee had recommended several measures to reduce vehicular pollution in the NCR, including the use of cleaner fuels, the phasing out of old vehicles, and the implementation of mass emission standards.

The second court order pertains to a dispute over the interpretation of a notification issued by the Central Government to control vehicular pollution in the NCR. The notification allowed vehicles manufactured prior to 1.4.2005 and complying with BS-I and BS-II norms but not more than 15 years old to ply, while vehicles manufactured after 1.4.2005 had to comply with BS-III norms to ply. The notification was issued under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and was aimed at improving air quality in the NCR.

The case before the court was related to the classification of vehicles under the notification. The High Court had interpreted the notification to mean that all vehicles manufactured prior to 1.4.2005 and complying with BS-I and BS-II norms were allowed to ply, irrespective of their age. The petitioners in the case challenged this interpretation, arguing that it would lead to an increase in vehicular pollution in the NCR.

The court held that the classification was necessary to phase out older vehicles in a phased manner while improving emission norms. The court found the High Court's interpretation of the notification to be incorrect and allowed the appeal. The court directed that the notification be implemented in a manner that would achieve the objective of reducing vehicular pollution in the NCR.

The third court order pertains to the enforcement of a provision (21) related to the use of CNG (compressed natural gas) in public transport vehicles in the NCR. The provision required that all public transport vehicles in the NCR be converted to CNG by a certain date. The High Court had interpreted the provision to mean that only those vehicles that were registered in the NCR were required to be converted to CNG.

The petitioners in the case challenged this interpretation, arguing that the provision applied to all public transport vehicles that entered the NCR, irrespective of their place of registration. The court held that the provision must be fully enforced and that the High Court had misinterpreted the notification. The court allowed the appeal and directed that the provision be implemented in a manner that would achieve the objective of reducing vehicular pollution in the NCR.

In conclusion, the Indian judiciary has been actively involved in addressing the issue of vehicular pollution in the NCR. The court orders summarized in this article highlight the importance of implementing measures to reduce vehicular pollution in the region. The court has upheld the eligibility criteria for trucks offered by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, directed that the committee's recommendations be strictly adhered to, and clarified the classification of vehicles under the notification. The court has also directed that the provision related to the use of CNG in public transport vehicles be fully enforced. These court orders are a step towards improving air quality in the NCR and ensuring a healthier environment for its residents.
