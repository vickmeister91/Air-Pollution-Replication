The court order in question pertains to a writ appeal filed against an order of removal from service passed against the respondent, who had been appointed as a Forest Ranger and was later promoted to the post of Assistant Conservator of Forests. The respondent had been suspended on multiple occasions and was served with charge memos containing allegations of neglect of duty, lack of discipline, and encroachment of forest land. The respondent denied the charges, and after an enquiry, the first appellant passed an order holding the charges to be proved and imposed the punishment of removal from service.

The respondent challenged the order in a writ petition, which was allowed by the learned single judge. The court found that the charge of encroachment of forest land was not established, and the order of removal from service was set aside. The writ appeal was dismissed, and the appellants were directed to settle the retirement benefits payable to the respondent.

The case highlights the importance of due process and the need for a fair and impartial enquiry before imposing any punishment on an employee. The respondent was given the opportunity to defend himself against the charges levelled against him, and the court found that the charge of encroachment of forest land was not established. This underscores the need for a thorough investigation and the importance of presenting evidence to support any allegations made against an employee.

The court's decision to set aside the order of removal from service and direct the appellants to settle the retirement benefits payable to the respondent is a reminder that any punishment imposed on an employee must be proportionate to the offence committed. In this case, the court found that the punishment of removal from service was not justified, given that one of the charges against the respondent was not established.

The case also highlights the importance of protecting the rights of employees and ensuring that they are not unfairly targeted or victimised. The respondent in this case was suspended on multiple occasions and was served with charge memos containing serious allegations. However, the court found that the charges were not established, and the respondent was able to successfully challenge the order of removal from service.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of due process, fair and impartial enquiries, and proportionate punishment. It also highlights the need to protect the rights of employees and ensure that they are not unfairly targeted or victimised.
