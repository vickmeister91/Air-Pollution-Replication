The case at hand involves a writ petition filed by an Executive Engineer serving in the Tripura State Pollution Board, challenging the initiation of departmental proceedings against him under the provisions of CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965. The petitioner argued that the said rules were not adopted by the Pollution Control Board as required under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and therefore, the proceedings were not sustainable in law.

The court, however, rejected the petitioner's argument and held that the respondent Board had adopted the CCS(CCA) Rules by its resolution, and the said rules were applicable to him. The court also criticized the petitioner's conduct of taking contrary pleas in different writ petitions.

The court order states that the CCS(CCA) Rules are applicable to officers and employees of the respondent Board and are a codification of principles of natural justice. The petitioner's plea that the rules are not applicable is dismissed, and there is no bar in conducting proceedings following the said rules. The petitioner's contradictory stand is not appreciated, and the writ petition is dismissed with a cost of Rs. 5,000/-.

The court's decision is based on the fact that the respondent Board had adopted the CCS(CCA) Rules by its resolution, and the said rules were applicable to the petitioner. The court also noted that the CCS(CCA) Rules are a codification of principles of natural justice and are applicable to officers and employees of the respondent Board.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the applicability of the CCS(CCA) Rules to officers and employees of the respondent Board. The court's decision also highlights the importance of consistency in legal arguments and the consequences of taking contradictory stands in different writ petitions.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of following established rules and procedures in legal proceedings. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to litigants to maintain consistency in their legal arguments and avoid taking contradictory stands in different writ petitions.
