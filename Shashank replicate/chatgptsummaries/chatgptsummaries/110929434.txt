The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Shashiprakash Mulchand Jayshwar under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The application sought regular bail prior to the filing of chargesheet in connection with III-C.R.No.302 of 2017 registered with Palsana Police Station, Surat Rural, District Surat for the offences punishable under Sections 65 E, 81 and 98(2) of the Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949.

After considering the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defence, the court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail subject to certain conditions.

The Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949, prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Gujarat. Section 65 E of the Act deals with the punishment for illegal possession or consumption of liquor. It states that whoever is found to be in possession of any intoxicant or liquor in contravention of the provisions of the Act shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with a fine which may extend to Rs. 5,000.

Section 81 of the Act deals with the punishment for abetment of an offence. It states that whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable under the Act shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.

Section 98(2) of the Act deals with the power of the police to arrest without a warrant. It states that any police officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector may arrest without a warrant any person who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned.

In the present case, the applicant was accused of violating these provisions of the Act. However, the court found that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant had committed the offences alleged against him. The court also noted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence.

Therefore, the court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail subject to certain conditions. The conditions included furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and two sureties of like amount, surrendering his passport, not leaving the country without the court's permission, and cooperating with the investigation.
