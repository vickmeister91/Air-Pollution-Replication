The Delhi High Court recently heard an appeal against an order passed by a Single Judge in a writ petition filed by A.V. Metal. The petition was filed against two orders passed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on September 14, 2007. The first order was passed after a show cause notice and granting opportunity, and the second order rejected consent applications under the Air and Water Acts without any show cause notice.

The Single Judge allowed the DPCC to re-inspect the premises of A.V. Metal and take appropriate action within two months. A.V. Metal was directed not to carry on any industrial or manufacturing activity until clearances/consents were granted by DPCC. The electricity supply to the premises of A.V. Metal would not be disconnected, but the company was prevented from carrying out any manufacturing or industrial activity until final action was taken by the DPCC. The DPCC was given liberty to inspect, issue notice, and pass orders after complying with the provisions and principles of natural justice.

The High Court found no error in the order and judgment passed by the Single Judge and disposed of the appeal accordingly.
