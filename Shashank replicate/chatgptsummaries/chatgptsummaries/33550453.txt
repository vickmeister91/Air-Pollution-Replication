The court order pertains to a second appeal filed against a judgment and decree passed in a suit for declaration and permanent injunction. The plaintiffs owned rice mills in Achukattu village and Netteri village, Kancheepuram Taluk, and claimed that they had been discharging their waste water through a plan marked channel for over 15 years. The defendant had recently constructed a compound wall, which blocked the channel and prevented the plaintiffs from discharging their waste water. The Courts below had accepted the plaintiffs' case and granted the necessary reliefs in their favor. The defendant had appealed against this decision, but the High Court upheld the lower courts' decision, finding that the plan channel was in existence and that the defendant had blocked it with his compound wall.

The court order upholds the decision of the lower courts in favor of the plaintiffs, who were seeking to discharge waste water from their rice mills through a plan marked channel. The defendant had raised objections, including that the plaintiffs had taken the commission ex-parte and that the waste water discharge would violate the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the court found that the defendant had not filed any objections to the commissioner's report and plan, and had not provided evidence to support their claims. The court dismissed the defendant's appeal and ordered that the waste water discharge be allowed.
