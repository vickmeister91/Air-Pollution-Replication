The court, after considering the nature of the offences, duration of judicial custody, and other circumstances, has granted bail to the petitioner on certain conditions.

The court has taken into account the seriousness of the offences that Elankovan has been accused of, which fall under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. This act is designed to protect wildlife and their habitats, and any violation of its provisions is considered a serious offence.

In addition to these factors, the court has also taken into account other circumstances, which are not specified in the court order. These circumstances may include the petitioner's personal circumstances, such as his age, health, and family situation, as well as any other factors that may be relevant to the case.

Despite the seriousness of the offences, the court has decided to grant bail to the petitioner. However, this bail is subject to certain conditions, which the petitioner must comply with in order to remain free. These conditions include reporting to the Investigating Officer on a regular basis, and not committing any offence while on bail.

The court has made it clear that if the petitioner breaches any of these conditions, the bail granted will be cancelled. This means that the petitioner will be taken back into custody and will have to remain there until the trial is completed.

The court has taken into account the seriousness of the offences, the duration of judicial custody, and other circumstances, and has decided to grant bail subject to certain conditions.
