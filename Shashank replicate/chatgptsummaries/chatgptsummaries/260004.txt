The Karnataka High Court recently heard three public interest litigations (PILs) related to environmental protection and preservation of natural resources. The first PIL was filed by residents of several villages who questioned the validity of a notification issued under the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Act. The residents argued that the lands earmarked for specific purposes in the revenue records and Comprehensive Development Plan should not be acquired and allotted for any non-agricultural purpose, including industrial purposes, as it would cause hardship to the villagers and cattle and have an adverse effect on the environment. The court recognized the importance of environmental protection and improvement and the right to a wholesome environment as a fundamental right. The court also cited several case laws related to environmental law and held that the government has a duty to protect and preserve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.

The second PIL dealt with the protection of natural resources such as rivers, forests, and sea shores. The court held that protecting these resources is essential for maintaining ecological balance and is a fundamental right. The court also held that the government had breached public trust by granting approval for the lease of land meant for grazing and greenery to a private company. The court quashed the lease and directed the polluting company to compensate for the protection and restitution of the environment. The court further stated that the public trust doctrine requires the government to protect resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court also held that the right to a pollution-free environment is a fundamental right and that other statutory provisions must yield to fundamental rights. The court also held that maintaining ecological equilibrium and a pollution-free atmosphere is essential for villages.

The third PIL dealt with the rights of villagers to enjoy grazing land and land reserved for green belts as a fundamental right. The court held that before finalizing the area of local bodies, people who will be affected by the change should be given an opportunity to be heard. The court cites previous cases where natural justice required an opportunity of being heard to be extended to the people of the area before administrative decisions were taken. The court directs authorities to leave a land area of 1 km as a buffer zone from the outer periphery of the village to maintain a green area towards preservation of land for grazing of cattle, agricultural operation, and for development of social forestry. The court quashes the notification and consequential proceedings or orders issued in regard to disputed lands that are reserved for grazing, agricultural, and residential purposes. However, the court does not wish to disturb the allotment made to the third respondent, which is essential to the growth of computer industry and research and development in information technology.

Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of environmental protection and preservation of natural resources. The court recognizes the fundamental right to a wholesome environment and the duty of the government to protect and preserve the environment. The court also upholds the public trust doctrine, which requires the government to protect resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court orders also emphasize the importance of maintaining ecological equilibrium and a pollution-free atmosphere for villages. The court orders provide a framework for balancing economic development with environmental protection and preservation of natural resources.
