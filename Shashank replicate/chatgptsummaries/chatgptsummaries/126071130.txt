The case pertains to a criminal investigation into the shooting of a female elephant, during which a car was seized by forest officers. The petitioner claimed to have bought the car from its registered owner and filed an application for its release. However, the court initially refused to release the car, citing doubts about the petitioner's ownership.

The court's decision to refuse the release of the car was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove his ownership of the vehicle. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to produce the original registration certificate of the car, which raised further doubts about his ownership.

However, the court ultimately allowed the release of the car subject to certain conditions. The petitioner was required to deposit Rs. 4,00,000 and provide an undertaking not to alienate or alter the vehicle. The court also directed the petitioner to produce the original registration certificate of the car within a period of 30 days.

The court's decision to allow the release of the car subject to certain conditions was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided some evidence to support his claim of ownership. The court noted that the petitioner had produced a copy of the sale agreement between him and the registered owner of the car, which indicated that the car had been sold to him.

The court also took into account the fact that the car had been in the custody of the forest department for a considerable period of time and that the petitioner had suffered financial losses as a result of the seizure of the car. The court therefore allowed the release of the car subject to the conditions mentioned above.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the release of a car seized by forest officers during an investigation into the shooting of a female elephant highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove ownership of a vehicle. The court's decision to allow the release of the car subject to certain conditions was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided some evidence to support his claim of ownership. The court's decision also takes into account the financial losses suffered by the petitioner as a result of the seizure of the car.
