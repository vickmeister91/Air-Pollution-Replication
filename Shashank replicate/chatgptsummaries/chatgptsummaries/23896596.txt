The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Ramji Das against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court order also mentions the transfer of another related case from the High Court to the NGT.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, due to ongoing maintenance work, water samples from distributories could not be collected. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records of the case. The State was warned of a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if they failed to submit the plans. The court also directed the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date.

This court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The State Government was directed to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered the State to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The State Government was also directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide complete information and relevant records. The court has also directed the authorities to take action against encroachers and recover compensation. The court has suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured by adopting the other statutory remedy. The petitioner seeks a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concludes that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is efficacious to meet the injury, if any caused to the petitioner, and if that involves any ground as required to invoke Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by moving appropriate application/representation.
