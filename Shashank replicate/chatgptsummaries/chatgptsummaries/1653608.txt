The petitioners argued that they had been allowed to do mining activities by the court earlier and that the prosecution was lodged with malafide intention. The court quashed the entire criminal proceeding, stating that the petitioners were allowed by the court to go ahead with the mining activities, and the present proceeding, if continued, would amount to an abuse of the process of the court.

The case in question involves allegations of illegal mining in a protected forest area.

The prosecution report alleged that the petitioners had extracted and mined coal from a protected forest area, which is a violation of the law.

The petitioners, however, argued that they had been allowed to do mining activities by the court earlier and that the prosecution was lodged with malafide intention.
