The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Jeevan Singh and another person against their conviction under Section 9 read with Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution case was that they were found in possession of beef of deer, bagging hook, and an axe. The court found that the lower courts had not committed any illegality in convicting the applicants and affirmed the fine amount awarded by the lower courts. However, the jail sentence was reduced to one year instead of three years, and the period of sentence already undergone by the applicants was adjusted. The court ordered that the supersession warrant of the applicants be prepared and sent to the concerned jail.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Section 9 of the Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 provides for punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act.

In this case, Jeevan Singh and another person were found in possession of beef of deer, bagging hook, and an axe, which are all prohibited under the Act. The lower courts had convicted them under Section 9 read with Section 51 of the Act and had awarded a jail sentence of three years and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. The applicants had filed a revision petition challenging their conviction and sentence.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, found that the lower courts had not committed any illegality in convicting the applicants. The court noted that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence to prove that the applicants were in possession of the prohibited items. The court also observed that the lower courts had correctly applied the provisions of the Act and had awarded an appropriate sentence.

However, the court found that the jail sentence of three years was excessive and needed to be reduced. The court noted that the applicants had already undergone a part of the sentence and that the period of sentence already undergone by them needed to be adjusted. The court, therefore, reduced the jail sentence to one year and ordered that the period of sentence already undergone by the applicants be adjusted.

The court also affirmed the fine amount awarded by the lower courts. The court noted that the fine amount of Rs. 10,000 each was appropriate and needed to be paid by the applicants. The court ordered that the supersession warrant of the applicants be prepared and sent to the concerned jail.

In conclusion, the court order in this case affirms the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats. The court has rightly upheld the conviction of the applicants under Section 9 read with Section 51 of the Act and has awarded an appropriate sentence. The reduction of the jail sentence to one year and the adjustment of the period of sentence already undergone by the applicants is a fair and just decision. The court's order also highlights the need for strict enforcement of the provisions of the Act and the need to deter others from committing similar offences.
