The Belvedere Tower Condominium Association filed a petition against a notification issued by the Environment Impact Assessment Committee regarding the installation of an electric substation in Gurgaon. The association argued that the installation of the substation would have a detrimental impact on the environment and the health of the residents. The association sought a writ of mandamus directing the committee to withdraw the notification and to conduct a fresh assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed substation.

The court, however, found that the petitioner had an alternate remedy to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and dismissed the writ petition on that ground. The court noted that the NGT had the expertise to deal with environmental matters and that the petitioner could approach the NGT for relief. The court also observed that the NGT had the power to issue directions to the committee to conduct a fresh assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed substation.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exploring alternate remedies before approaching the court. In this case, the court found that the petitioner had an alternate remedy available to them and dismissed the writ petition on that ground. This decision is in line with the principle of judicial restraint, which requires courts to exercise caution in interfering with the decisions of administrative bodies.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of environmental impact assessments in development projects. The committee's notification was issued pursuant to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, which requires developers to conduct an environmental impact assessment before undertaking any development project. The purpose of the assessment is to identify the potential environmental impacts of the project and to suggest measures to mitigate those impacts. The court's decision reinforces the importance of complying with the notification and conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment before undertaking any development project.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the Belvedere Tower Condominium Association case highlights the importance of exploring alternate remedies before approaching the court and the importance of complying with environmental impact assessment requirements in development projects. The court's decision is in line with the principle of judicial restraint and underscores the importance of the National Green Tribunal in dealing with environmental matters.
