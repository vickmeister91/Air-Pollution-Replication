In January 2010, the court received an application from two accused individuals, Mohammad Mustafa and Mustkeem, who were seeking to have the orders of bailable and non-bailable warrants issued against them in a wildlife protection case quashed. The accused claimed that they were already out on bail and had not been served with any summons.

The court reviewed the case and directed the accused to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The court also stated that if the accused were to move an application for recalling the non-bailable warrants, it would be considered sympathetically. The application was disposed of on January 28, 2010.

The case in question pertains to a wildlife protection case, which suggests that the accused may have been involved in some form of illegal activity related to wildlife. The fact that they were seeking to have the warrants against them quashed indicates that they were likely trying to avoid further legal action.

It is unclear from the available information why the accused were already out on bail, or what the specific charges against them were. However, the fact that they had not been served with any summons suggests that they may have been attempting to evade the legal process.

The court's decision to direct the accused to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate indicates that they were not willing to simply quash the warrants against them without further investigation. The court's statement that it would consider sympathetically any application for recalling the non-bailable warrants suggests that the accused may have had some valid reason for not appearing in court.

Overall, the court order in this case is relatively brief and does not provide a great deal of detail about the underlying case. However, it does suggest that the accused were involved in some form of illegal activity related to wildlife, and that they were attempting to avoid further legal action. The court's decision to direct them to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate indicates that they were not willing to simply let the accused off the hook without further investigation.
