The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The details of each petition and petitioner are provided in the order. The court heard all the petitions together and delivered a common judgment.

One of the petitions pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice related to mining activity in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department. The government issued a notification in 2015 requiring the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) within two years, which was to be kept in a fund for maintaining ecological balance. The respondents demanded a specific amount of NPV from the mining lease holders, which they deposited under protest.

Another petition pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the compensation amount. The petitioner argued that they were being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas, which was beyond their individual leaseholdings. The petitioner also pointed out that a government letter stated that the provisions of Net Present Value (NPV) shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argued that the status of the cluster had changed since the diversion and that some lease holders were not interested in extending the validity period of diversion.

Another petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The last petition pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and only the extension proposal for the rest of the mining leases was submitted. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard all the petitions together and delivered a common judgment. The petitions pertain to disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases, and to divide the total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.
