The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/s New Maghar Stone Crusher against an order passed by the Chief Environmental Engineer, Punjab Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had challenged the order on the grounds that it was arbitrary, illegal, and without jurisdiction. However, the court dismissed the petition as the petitioner had not availed the remedy of filing an appeal against the order.

The court observed that the petitioner had not challenged the order before the Appellate Authority, which was the appropriate forum for such a challenge. The court noted that the petitioner had not even filed an application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal. The court held that the petitioner had failed to exhaust the available remedies before approaching the court and, therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable.

However, the court granted the petitioner liberty to withdraw the petition and file an appeal with an application for condonation of delay within 15 days. The court hoped that the Appellate Authority would consider and decide the appeal in accordance with the law.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. The court has consistently held that writ jurisdiction is an extraordinary remedy and should be invoked only when all other remedies have been exhausted. The court has also emphasized that the Appellate Authority is the appropriate forum for challenging orders passed by regulatory bodies such as the Punjab Pollution Control Board.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of complying with procedural requirements. The court noted that the petitioner had not even filed an application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal. The court has consistently held that procedural requirements must be strictly complied with and that non-compliance can result in the dismissal of the petition.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by M/s New Maghar Stone Crusher serves as a reminder of the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court and complying with procedural requirements. The court has consistently held that writ jurisdiction is an extraordinary remedy and should be invoked only when all other remedies have been exhausted. The court has also emphasized that the Appellate Authority is the appropriate forum for challenging orders passed by regulatory bodies such as the Punjab Pollution Control Board.
