The court order summaries provided pertain to various cases involving sugar factories in Maharashtra. The parties involved in the cases include Grampanchayat Aashti, Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd., Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., the Commissioner of Sugar Maharashtra State, the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and the Union of India. The details of the cases are not provided in some of the summaries.

One of the cases involves the grant of aerial distance certificates and the construction of a sugar factory on land in Aashti village. The court heard all the matters together and disposed of them in a common judgment. The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, as long as they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji ultimately receiving one and beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and others, leading to a court order restraining Audumbarraoji from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained. The Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice for objections, and nine were received, mostly from the petitioners in the present writ petitions/PIL.

Another case involves the setting up of a new sugar factory by Audumbarraoji. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the proposed factory was more than 15 km away from existing sugar factories, as required by the Sugarcane Control Order. However, several individuals filed writ petitions challenging this certification. The court considered the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, which specify the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory. These include obtaining a certificate from the concerned state government that the proposed site is at least the minimum distance away from existing sugar factories, and submitting a performance guarantee for implementation of the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum within a stipulated time. The court specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but who have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court will consider the objections of Lokshakti, who challenged the grant of aerial distance certificate to Audumbarraoji. The court will also consider the decision of the Division Bench of the court at Aurangabad in Gangamai Industries & Construction Limited vs. State of Maharashtra and Others.

In another case, the court discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court refers to a previous case, Gangamai, which established that the Survey of India has the power to determine the minimum distance between sugar factories. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was made earlier and therefore justified, despite objections from Lokshakti. The court also notes that the change of name from Gopal Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited to Audumbarraoji Sakhar Karkhana Limited was legal and that both entities are the same. Ultimately, the court rejects Lokshakti's claim and upholds the grant of the certificate to Audumbarraoji.

The court also addresses a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their facilities at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The court found that the IEM in favor of one factory had become inoperative due to failure to take effective steps within the stipulated time period. The court also rejected the contention that the factory had made an application for change of location.

In another case, the court discusses a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application to amend their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM) to correct the location of their proposed sugar factory. The court determines that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement dated January 12, 2006, is to be treated as a fresh IEM registered in favor of Jaywant for the first time. The court also considers whether Audumbarraoji has taken effective steps within the stipulated period of two years from the date of IEM and concludes that effective steps were taken. The court dismisses the Public Interest Litigation No. 23 of 2013 and writ petition. The court also discusses a separate writ petition filed by Grampanchayat Aashti, seeking directions to stop all construction activity of a sugar factory undertaken by Audumbarraoji on land Gat No. 195(3), situated at Aashti, taluka Mohol, district Solapur. The court determines that mandatory permissions were obtained by Audumbarraoji and dismisses the writ petition.

In another case, the petitioner alleges that a sugar factory was built without proper permissions
