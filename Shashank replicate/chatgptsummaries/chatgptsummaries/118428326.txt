Salman Khan, a Bollywood actor, has been involved in multiple cases of alleged hunting and killing of wildlife. The court order pertains to three separate cases registered for three different alleged incidents of hunting. In the first case, Salman Khan has been convicted for the offence under Section 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act for the incident of hunting, which is alleged to have taken place on 26.09.1998 and pertains to FIR No.162/1998. He has been sentenced to undergo one year's simple imprisonment along with a fine of Rs.5000/-. The State of Rajasthan has preferred an appeal for enhancement of the sentence of one year awarded to the accused-Salman Khan by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jodhpur which is now registered as S.B.Criminal Appeal No.267/2006. Another appeal has been filed by the State of Rajasthan against the acquittal of the co-accused as well as acquittal of accused-Salman Khan under Sections 143, 144, 148, 201, 149 of the IPC, which is registered as S.B.Criminal Appeal No.685/2006.

In the second case, the court order discusses a case against Salman Khan for alleged hunting of deer on multiple occasions. The court finds that the evidence against Khan is based on the statement of a witness who was not cross-examined in court, making his statement inadmissible. The court also criticizes the Forest Department for lodging multiple cases against Khan and relying on faulty investigation. The court ultimately acquits Khan of all charges.

In the third case, the court order states that a statement of a witness recorded under Section 164, Cr.P.C. cannot be admitted into evidence at trial under Section 33 of the Evidence Act. The statement of Harish Dulani, recorded while he was in custody of the Forest Department, is deemed unreliable and cannot be read in evidence. The prosecution's case is weakened by the fact that Harish Dulani did not appear as a witness and the statement of prosecution witness Arun Kumar Yadav contradicts the prosecution's version of events. The court dismisses the State's application to take additional evidence on record and concludes that the prosecution is left with only circumstantial evidence to prove its case. The evidentiary value of the recovery of alleged blood stains, hair, and pellets has been questioned, and the prosecution has not been able to prove that the gypsy was kept in safe custody.

In the fourth case, the court order discusses the lack of evidence in the case against Salman Khan for hunting and killing two blackbucks. The court questions the authenticity of the recovery of the weapons and the gypsy used during the incident, as well as the lack of proper custody of the evidence. The court also notes inconsistencies in witness testimonies and the prosecution's reliance on a written note by Salman Khan. Ultimately, the court finds that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquits Salman Khan of all charges.

In the fifth case, the court order discusses the evidence presented in the case against Salman Khan for illegal hunting. The court questions the credibility of witnesses and the validity of the recovered weapon, as well as the pellets found at the scene. The prosecution was unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Khan used the weapon for illegal hunting, and the court concludes that it is unclear which weapon was used to kill the deer. The court also notes that air guns are not typically used for hunting large game like deer.

In the sixth case, the court order discusses the lack of evidence in a case involving the alleged killing of a deer by Salman Khan. The prosecution failed to prove the use of any weapon, including the air gun recovered from Salman, in the killing of the deer. The recovery of a knife from another accused was also not supported by evidence. The blood stains recovered from a hotel and a vehicle were not conclusively linked to the incident, and the prosecution's case relied solely on circumstantial evidence. The court ultimately acquitted Salman Khan of all charges.

In the seventh case, Salman Khan has been acquitted of the offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act. The court found it impossible to kill a deer with an air gun, which is not a firearm. The pellets recovered from the scene did not match any of the weapons recovered from Salman Khan or Saif Ali Khan. The court set aside the judgment and order dated 17.02.2006 and acquitted Salman Khan of the charges levelled against him. The appeals filed by the State were dismissed.

In conclusion, Salman Khan has been involved in multiple cases of alleged hunting and killing of wildlife. The court orders in these cases highlight the lack of evidence and inconsistencies in witness testimonies. The court has acquitted Salman Khan of all charges in most of these cases due to the prosecution's inability to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court has also criticized the Forest Department for faulty investigation and lodging multiple cases against Salman Khan.
