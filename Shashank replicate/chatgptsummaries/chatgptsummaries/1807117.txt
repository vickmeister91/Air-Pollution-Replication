The court order pertains to a dispute between the General Manager of Telecommunications and a former Member of Parliament over the disconnection of telephone connections due to non-payment of charges. The court referred the matter for arbitration under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1957, and directed the parties to maintain status quo until the dispute is resolved. The court also held that disputes concerning telegraph lines, appliances, or apparatus must be determined by arbitration and cannot be entertained by civil courts.

The dispute in question arose due to non-payment of telephone charges by the former Member of Parliament. The General Manager of Telecommunications disconnected the telephone connections of the former MP, which led to a legal battle between the two parties. The General Manager of Telecommunications filed a suit in the civil court seeking recovery of the outstanding dues and disconnection of the telephone connections. The former MP, on the other hand, filed a counter-suit seeking restoration of the telephone connections and damages for wrongful disconnection.

The civil court, in its previous order, had directed the General Manager of Telecommunications to restore the telephone connections of the former MP and had also restrained the General Manager from disconnecting the telephone connections in the future. The General Manager of Telecommunications challenged this order in the higher court, which set aside the previous order and referred the matter for arbitration under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1957.

The court held that disputes concerning telegraph lines, appliances, or apparatus must be determined by arbitration and cannot be entertained by civil courts. The court also directed the parties to maintain status quo until the dispute is resolved through arbitration. This means that the telephone connections of the former MP will remain disconnected until the arbitrator passes a final award in the matter.

The court order also states that if there is any doubt or dispute regarding a specific matter, the subscriber can request arbitration proceedings. This means that either party can approach the arbitrator if they have any doubts or disputes regarding the matter. The court held that the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit of this nature and set aside the previous order.

Both revisions were allowed, and there were no costs. This means that both parties were allowed to revise their claims before the arbitrator, and neither party was ordered to pay any costs for the legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a dispute between the General Manager of Telecommunications and a former Member of Parliament over the disconnection of telephone connections due to non-payment of charges. The court referred the matter for arbitration under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1957, and directed the parties to maintain status quo until the dispute is resolved.
