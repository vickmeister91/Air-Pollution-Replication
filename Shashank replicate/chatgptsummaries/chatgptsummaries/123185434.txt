The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard three appeals against the Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the power to issue directions for environmental protection. The Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, provides for the Central Government to issue directions and prohibitions on industries and processes in different areas. Section 6 of the Act empowers the Central Government to make rules in respect of all or any of the matters referred to in Section 3. The Central Government framed the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, which specify the nature of action to be taken and the time within which it shall be complied with by the person, officer, or authority to whom such direction is given. The person, officer, or authority to whom any direction is sought to be issued shall be served with a copy of the proposed direction and shall be given an opportunity of not less than fifteen days from the date of service of a notice to file with an officer designated in this behalf the objections, if any, to the issue of the proposed direction.

The court order discusses the rules and procedures for the Central Government to issue directions and prohibitions on industries and processes in different areas. Rule 4 deals with general directions and the procedure for compliance, while Rule 5 specifically addresses the location of industries and processes. The rules provide for an opportunity for affected parties to file objections and for the Central Government to consider them before issuing a direction. However, there are exceptions to the principle of natural justice in certain situations. Rule 5(4) allows the Central Government to pass an order without complying with the procedure if it is in the public interest to do so.

The order in question directed the suspension of environmental clearances for 139 mining cases in Goa pending further scrutiny. Private stakeholders challenged the order, claiming it violated natural justice and was arbitrary. The order specifically affected M/s. Lithoferro, which holds mining lease rights to an iron ore mine in North Goa. The appellant claims to have all necessary licenses and permits for mining and employs around 300 people. The company claims to have all necessary licenses and permits and has carried out social responsibility projects for the local community. The appeal also raises concerns about the non-adherence to principles of natural justice and non-recording of reasons in the impugned order.

The court discusses the basic principles of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of adherence to these principles to prevent miscarriage of justice. The court also notes that flexibility in the process of natural justice is important for applying these principles. The court emphasizes that the principles of natural justice are intended to prevent injustice and secure fair play in administrative action. However, there are exceptions to the audi alteram partem rule, and the court must consider the language and purpose of the relevant statutory provision when determining whether natural justice principles apply. The court also notes that natural justice can be excluded in exceptional circumstances where fairness in action does not demand its implication.

The order cites specific cases where the principles of natural justice can be subject to exceptions, depending on the circumstances and facts of a given case. The order also explains that the expression "public interest" in Rule 5(4) of the Rules is an exception to the rule of audi alteram partem, and can only be used by the Central Government when it is in the public interest to do so. The order provides various interpretations of the term "public interest" and emphasizes that it must be understood in the context of the entire legislation and its objectives.

The court emphasizes the need to balance public interest with individual interests and the duty of the government to protect the environment. The court also criticizes the High Court for overstepping its bounds and making value judgments instead of focusing on the decision-making process of the relevant authority. The order also discusses the factual matrix of the case and the violations committed by the appellant.

The order was passed in public interest and based on the Shah Commission's report, which found unacceptable activities being carried out in mining operations. The order suspends the environmental clearance granted to the appellant and states reasons for doing so. The order is not considered to be in violation of the principles of natural justice and is based on material and recorded reasons. The order also notes that there is an imminent threat to the environment and untimely exhaustion of mining reserves of iron ore in the State of Goa.

The court states that non-observance of natural justice must cause real prejudice to the person concerned and not just be a technical infringement. The court also discusses the theory of useless or empty formality, where compliance with natural justice can be avoided if admitted and undisputed facts lead to only one conclusion. The court applies these principles to a specific case involving the suspension of mining activity and directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests to complete its inquiry and pass appropriate orders within three months. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed the power of the Central Government to issue directions for environmental protection and the rules and procedures for compliance. The court emphasized the importance of adherence to natural justice principles and the exceptions to the audi alteram partem rule. The court also discussed the concept of public interest and its importance in decision-making processes. The court ordered the suspension of mining operations in Goa due to violations of environmental norms and statutory requirements and directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests to complete its inquiry and pass appropriate orders within three months.
