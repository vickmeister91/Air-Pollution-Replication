The court orders mentioned in the given text pertain to various cases filed under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, against the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC). The cases involve accidents and claims for compensation filed by individuals, some of whom are minors represented by their mothers or natural guardians. The court partially allowed the claims for compensation and ordered the appellants to deposit the awarded amount with interest. 

In one case, the court found that the accident was caused by the negligent driving of the bus driver and awarded compensation to the claimants. The APSRTC, the bus company, was held liable for the accident and was also questioned by the court. The court order details the various claim petitions and the compensation awarded to each claimant. The court also ordered compensation for the claimants' medical expenses, pain and suffering, and loss of amenities. The total compensation awarded was Rs. 315,000.

In another case, the court examined evidence presented by both the claimants and the respondents, including witness testimony and documents. The court concluded that the driver of the Marathi van was responsible for the accident due to rash and negligent driving. The occupants of the van were not held responsible. The court also discussed the rule of the road and the duty of drivers to keep a lookout for other traffic. The court challenged the evidence of one witness and noted discrepancies in the timing of certain documents.

In yet another case, the court found that the bus belonging to the corporation was at fault for the accident and that the owner or insurer of the vehicle should be held responsible. The court also criticized the corporation for not obtaining insurance information from the owner of the vehicle and not conducting interrogatories. The court concluded that the tribunal was not justified in recording a finding in the absence of tortfeasor.

The court also awarded compensation to claimants in various cases. In one case, an injured person was awarded compensation for medical expenses, future loss of income, and amenities. In another case, the family of a deceased person who was working as a tailor was awarded compensation based on her income and dependency. In the third case, the family of another deceased person who was working for the municipality was awarded compensation based on his income and dependency. The court reviewed the evidence and determined the appropriate compensation for each case.

In some cases, the court found that the negligence cannot be attributed solely to the driver of the bus and that the claimants are also responsible to some extent. The court upheld the judgment and award passed by the tribunal but found that the compensation awarded was on the lower side and required some modification. The court also considered various documents and evidence presented by the claimants in support of their claims.

Overall, the court orders deal with cases of accidents and claims for compensation filed against the APSRTC. The court partially allowed the claims for compensation and ordered the appellants to deposit the awarded amount with interest. The court also examined evidence presented by both the claimants and the respondents, including witness testimony and documents, and determined the appropriate compensation for each case.
