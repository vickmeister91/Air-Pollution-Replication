The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving stone crushers in Rajasthan and the actions taken by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) against them. In the first case, the owners of stone crushers challenged two orders passed by the RSPCB. The court found that the impugned orders were non-speaking orders and violated the principles of natural justice. The court allowed the writ petitions and quashed and set aside the orders passed by the Board.

In the second case, the court discussed the powers of the State Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court found that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court due to violations of natural justice and fundamental rights. The Board argued that it was justified in relying on previous notices and replies from the petitioners, and that it had given cogent reasons for its decisions. However, the court ultimately upheld the writ petitions.

The third case discussed the legal requirements for granting consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond adequately. The court also noted that the Board did not follow proper procedures in revoking the consent order and closing down the unit. Overall, the court found that the Board's actions were legally unsustainable and ordered that the unit be allowed to operate.

In the fourth case, the court granted a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that has defaulted in complying with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher did not have adequate pollution control measures during an inspection and that the Board did not provide evidence that the deficiencies were not corrected. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders but directed the Board to consider the applications for renewal of consent and inspect the sites to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government is directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, in the fifth case, the court ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and ensuring that natural justice and fundamental rights are upheld in cases involving pollution control measures and industrial operations. The court has taken a firm stance in ensuring that the RSPCB follows the prescribed procedures and that industries are given adequate notice and information before any action is taken against them. The formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones is also a positive step towards ensuring that pollution control measures are implemented effectively in the state.
