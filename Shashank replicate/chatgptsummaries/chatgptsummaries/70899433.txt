The court order involves multiple cases where various hospitals and medical associations in Delhi are petitioners and the Union of India and other government bodies are respondents. The details of the cases and the arguments presented by both sides are not provided in the summary. The court order discusses the regulations and requirements for nursing homes in Delhi, including the need for registration and compliance with municipal building bye-laws and land use norms. The 1992 amendment to the Delhi Nursing Homes Registration Rules is challenged as being violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, as it would render many nursing homes unauthorized and deprive them of benefits. The court directed a survey of all nursing homes in Delhi and the DDA filed an affidavit stating that the Master Plan prohibits the use of residential premises for nursing homes and restricts commercial activity to the ground floor.

The court order allows professional activity in a residential plot on any floor, as long as the resident uses no more than 25% of their residence or 50 sq.m for non-residential purposes. The Delhi Building Bye-Laws 1953 regulate activities under the jurisdiction of Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The court also issued an interim direction not to take any action under the provisions of Delhi Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1953 for non-compliance with the provisions of Rule 3 of Delhi Nursing Homes Registration (Amendment) Rules 1992, provided they fulfill all the requisite medical standards as prescribed under Delhi Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1954 and Rules framed thereunder except amended Rule 3 of the Rules. The court emphasized the importance of the Master Plan prepared under a statute for the planned development of an urban conglomeration and that a space earmarked for a particular purpose under the Master Plan cannot be used for any other.

The court order discusses the legality of nursing homes operating without proper registration and compliance with land use norms in Delhi. The court upholds the requirement for nursing homes to conform to the MPD land use norms and other applicable statutory norms, including the EPA and MTP Act. The court rejects the plea that the 1992 amendment to the Rules is unconstitutional and affirms the order to refuse registration to nursing homes that violate these norms. The court also categorizes nursing homes into three categories and decides that those operating without any registration and have not applied for it till date do not deserve any protection or equitable consideration and should be shut down forthwith. The court emphasizes that judicial discretion cannot be guided by expediency and that justice must be rendered in accordance with the law.

The court order states that discretion cannot be used to encourage or perpetuate illegality, and unauthorised construction that is illegal and cannot be compounded must be demolished. Judicial discretion must be guided by law and set legal principles, not personal predilections. The court also notes that illegal activities put a strain on infrastructure and violate the constitutional rights of residents. The order specifically addresses nursing homes operating without proper registration and grants a grace period for those seeking registration, but warns that failure to comply will result in closure. The order dismisses all pending applications and vacates all interim orders.
