The case of Khitish Barman versus the District Magistrate of Bongaigaon revolves around the petitioner's challenge to an order that prohibited him from further earth cutting in his patta land. The petitioner had been granted permission by the District Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority to carry out earth cutting from his own patta land for a project of laying a double railway track line. However, the petitioner was required to obtain a mining permit under the Mines and Minerals Act, but the prohibitory order was not passed on that ground.

The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that it was arbitrary and without any basis in law. The court stayed the impugned order and issued notice to the respondents. The case is listed for hearing on 27.02.2019.

The case raises important questions about the rights of landowners and the extent to which they can use their land for development projects. The petitioner argues that he has a right to use his patta land for the railway project, and that the prohibitory order is an infringement of his rights. On the other hand, the District Magistrate argues that the petitioner did not obtain the necessary mining permit, and that the order was passed to prevent environmental damage.

The court will have to consider these arguments and determine whether the prohibitory order was justified. It will also have to consider the broader implications of the case for landowners and development projects in the region. The case highlights the need for clear guidelines and regulations governing the use of land for development projects, and the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection.

In conclusion, the case of Khitish Barman versus the District Magistrate of Bongaigaon raises important questions about the rights of landowners and the extent to which they can use their land for development projects. The court will have to consider these arguments and determine whether the prohibitory order was justified. The case highlights the need for clear guidelines and regulations governing the use of land for development projects, and the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection.
