The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Chandigarh issued several orders in 2017 and 2018 regarding complaints against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd., an IREO Group Company. The complaints were filed by various individuals and involved issues such as non-delivery of promised services and breach of contract. The cases were argued by different advocates and the decisions were made on August 24, 2018.

One court order pertains to eight consumer complaints against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd., an IREO Group Company, for failing to deliver plots to the complainants as per the agreement. The complainants sought a refund of the deposited amounts along with interest, compensation, and litigation costs. The court heard arguments in common and agreed to dispose of all complaints by passing a consolidated order. The court took the facts from one of the complaints and noted that possession of the plot was to be delivered within 24 months as per the agreement.

Another court order pertains to a complaint filed by a plot buyer against the opposite party for deficiency in providing services and unfair trade practices. The complainant paid an amount of Rs.61,79,232/- to the opposite party for a plot, and as per the agreement, possession was to be delivered within 24 months from the date of agreement plus 6 months grace period, which period expired in April 2014. The opposite party offered possession in June 2015, but it was only a paper possession as there were no promised amenities at the site. The complainant sought a refund of Rs.62,25,204/- along with interest, compensation, and cost of litigation. The opposite party raised objections, including the existence of an arbitration clause and the complaint being contractual in nature. The court rejected these objections and held that the complaint was maintainable. The court also held that housing construction or building activity carried on by a private or statutory body constitutes 'service' within the ambit of Section 2 (1) (o) of the Consumer Protection Act. The court further held that the complainant falls within the definition of a consumer and has the right to avail of the alternative remedy provided under Section 3 of the Act. The court also held that it has territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide the complaint.

In another court order, the court rejected the objection raised by the opposite party regarding territorial jurisdiction and the complainant's status as a consumer. The court also noted that the complainant had concealed a material fact in his complaint and had not come with clean hands. The court cited legal precedents to emphasize the importance of disclosing all relevant facts and approaching the court with clean hands.

The court order states that a litigant must produce all relevant documents when approaching the court and withholding vital documents to gain an advantage is considered fraud. In this case, the complainant concealed a material fact and therefore did not come to court with clean hands. However, due to the complainant being a poor consumer, the court allowed a refund of the deposited amount minus 10% of the sale consideration of the plot. The court did not grant compensation for mental agony and harassment but awarded costs of litigation. The possession of the plot(s) in question was offered to some complainants but not to others, and refund was sought in all cases. The court referred to previous cases and decided in favor of the complainants.

Another court order states that the plot in question was cancelled due to non-payment of installments. The complainants alleged that the possession offered was incomplete and lacked basic facilities like roads, sewerage, drinking water, electricity, street lights, drainage, etc. The court found that the opposite parties were deficient in rendering service and indulged in unfair trade practices by offering a paper possession before completing the development and obtaining necessary approvals. The complainants are entitled to a refund of the deposited amount along with interest at 13% p.a.

In yet another court order, the complainants are entitled to a refund of their deposited amounts along with interest. In one case, the complainant is entitled to a refund of Rs.2,10,689 with interest, while in another case, the complainants are entitled to a refund of Rs.55,94,046 and Rs.65,60,717 respectively, with interest. The court also orders the opposite parties to pay compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in service, and unfair trade practices. The court sets a deadline for the payment of the amounts and costs of litigation. The court also cites previous judgments that state that not more than 10% of the earnest money can be forfeited.

Finally, the court has ordered the opposite parties to pay compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service, and unfair trade practices to the complainants. The amount of compensation ranges from Rs. 1,00,000 to Rs. 2,00,000, and the cost of litigation is Rs. 35,000. The opposite parties are also directed to refund the complainants' amounts ranging from Rs. 2,10,689 to Rs. 60,29,293, along with interest. If the payment is not made within 45 days, the opposite parties will have to pay interest ranging from 13% to 15% per annum. The court has also directed that certified copies of the order be placed in the files of connected complaints and sent to the parties free of charge.
