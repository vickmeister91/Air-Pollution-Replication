The Karnataka High Court has issued several judgments regarding the development of the power sector in India. In 1991, the Electricity (Supply) Act was amended to allow private parties to establish, operate, and maintain generating stations. The Karnataka government approved a policy to invite foreign investors to augment its generating capacity, and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with several companies. However, the court discussed the various clearances required for setting up a thermal power plant, including those from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also referenced the Environment (Protection) Act and the Coastal Regulation Zone regulations.

One court order pertains to two writ petitions regarding the setting up of a 1000 MW Cogentrix thermal power plant in the ecologically sensitive coastal area of Karnataka without proper environmental clearance and without considering the impact on the fragile ecosystem. The order sets limits on the steam generation capacity of the plant based on the emission rate of SO2 and the neighboring building height. The order also highlights the adverse impacts of industrialization on the environment, including loss of agricultural land, water scarcity, air and water pollution, and threats to marine life and public health. The court notes violations of the Coastal Regulations Zone Notification and Forest Conservation Act and policies. The order emphasizes the need for comprehensive environmental impact assessments and appropriate coastal management plans before allowing such projects.

Another court order requires the cutting of trees in a specific area and raises concerns about the environmental impact of a thermal power plant in the region. The court argues that the plant, along with other highly polluting industries, will harm the fragile coastal ecology and the health of local residents. The court also criticizes the government for ignoring its own orders to conduct a study on the carrying capacity of the environment before approving new projects. The court orders the Ministry of Environment and Forests not to grant any further environmental clearances without comprehensive impact assessments and to revoke permissions granted to power projects that violate environmental protection laws. The court also discusses the measures taken by the project proponents to safeguard the environment and argues that environmental impact assessments are an important tool for ensuring sustainable development.

The court order discusses the process of granting environmental clearance for a proposed thermal power plant in Nandikur, Karnataka. The order states that various reports and assessments were conducted to ensure that the project would not have adverse impacts on the environment and the local community. The order also addresses concerns raised by the petitioner regarding pollution, displacement of people, and destruction of natural resources. The State Government argues that the project will promote sustainable development and prosperity in the region. The order concludes that the clearance given by the Ministry is legal and the contentions raised by the petitioner are unfounded.

The court order discusses the establishment of a thermal power plant in Karnataka and the objections raised against it. The State government argues that power is necessary for development and that the power shortage in the region needs to be addressed. The power plant has undergone environmental impact assessments and has been granted clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The government also addresses concerns about the impact on the environment, including air and water pollution, ash disposal, and the transmission line. The court ultimately upholds the clearance granted to the power plant.

The court order discusses a case regarding the establishment of a 1000 MW coal-based thermal power plant in Dakshina Kannada district, India. The petitioners argue that the project will have adverse effects on the environment, including air and water pollution, loss of forest cover, and displacement of religious and cultural centers. They also claim that the authorities granted clearances without carrying out a comprehensive environmental impact assessment or assessing the carrying capacity of the region. The court directs the concerned authorities to comply with environmental laws and protect the environment while promoting sustainable development.

The court order discusses a petition against the establishment of a power plant in Dakshina Kannada, India. The petitioners argue that the project violates environmental laws and will harm the region's agriculture and natural resources. The court examines the clearances given by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment and Forests and finds that the project has been given environmental clearance subject to certain conditions. The court also discusses the constitutional duty of the state and citizens to protect and improve the environment and the importance of environmental protection laws.

The court order discusses the need to protect the environment, particularly in coastal regions, and the concept of sustainable development. The court emphasizes the importance of balancing economic growth with conservation and protecting natural resources. The order also provides details about a proposed power plant project and the steps taken to assess its potential environmental impact. The court notes the importance of collecting baseline data on ecology and socio-economic aspects, and highlights the need to use fresh water cooling systems and prevent water discharge into nearby rivers and estuaries. The court ultimately emphasizes the need for sustainable development and protecting the environment for future generations.

The court order discusses the environmental impact of a proposed 1000 MW coal-based thermal power plant in Karnataka, India. The site is located near the Mulki river estuary and the Arabian Sea, and the report examines the impact on the flora and fauna of the area, as well as the potential socio-economic impact on the local population. The report suggests various proposals to mitigate the environmental impact, including using low ash, high calorific content imported coal, not taking plant makeup water from the Mulki river estuary, and providing an integrated effluent treatment plant with waste disposal into the Arabian Sea. The concept of carrying
