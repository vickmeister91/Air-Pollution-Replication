The court order pertains to a dispute over mining operations in a leased area within the Kaimur Wild Life Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner, Kamla Kant Pandey, had filed a writ petition seeking to quash orders passed by various respondents and to extend the period of lease beyond 12.3.2006. The dispute arose over whether the leased area lies within the sanctuary and whether the petitioner is entitled to perform mining operations in the leased area.

The court heard arguments from both parties and ultimately upheld the government's decision to cancel the lease, finding that the leased area was indeed within the sanctuary. The court also rejected the petitioner's claim that the Secretary of the Industrial Development Department had violated principles of natural justice.

However, the court partially allowed the writ petition regarding mining operations on the disputed land. The court found that the leased land is a part of the sanctuary and remitted the matter to the government to decide whether to grant permission for mining operations in accordance with Section 29 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. If permission is not granted, the government must return the money deposited by the petitioner for the lease, along with interest. The concerned authority must make a decision within three months.

The court also found that the petitioner is entitled to interest on the amount to be refunded at the rate applicable to fixed deposits in nationalized banks. Both parties will bear their own costs.

The court's decision highlights the importance of protecting wildlife sanctuaries and upholding environmental laws. The Kaimur Wild Life Sanctuary is home to a variety of endangered species, and mining operations could have a detrimental impact on their habitat.

The court's ruling also emphasizes the need for transparency and fairness in government decision-making processes. The petitioner had alleged that the Secretary of the Industrial Development Department had violated principles of natural justice, but the court found no evidence to support this claim.

Overall, the court's decision strikes a balance between protecting the environment and ensuring that individuals and businesses are not unfairly deprived of their rights. The government must carefully consider the impact of mining operations on wildlife before granting permission, and individuals must follow the law and respect the boundaries of protected areas.
