The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the execution of orders passed in writ petitions and the recovery of costs awarded in specific cases. In the first case, a cable TV operator challenged an order passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in appeal before the Consumer Disputes State Commission. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition with costs, and the office of the High Court certified the costs. The respondent filed an Execution Petition before the Court of the Munsiff of Parappanangadi for execution of the order to pay costs passed by the High Court in the Writ Petition. The petitioner resisted the Execution Petition, contending that the petition was not maintainable in law and that he had no means to pay the amount sought to be realized. The court held that an order in a Writ Petition cannot be regarded as a decree or an order capable of being executed by the civil court.

In the second case, the court discusses the execution of a writ petition order for possession of land. The respondent filed an application stating that the proceedings were null and void as no decree in a civil suit was passed. The court held that the order passed in extraordinary jurisdiction cannot be deemed a decree or order under the Code of Civil Procedure. The court explains the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure for the execution of decrees and orders, including transfer of decrees, certification of execution, and transmission of decrees for execution. The court also notes that specific rules are needed for the execution of orders for payment of costs made in a writ petition. The court concludes that the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain an execution petition for the order for payment of costs passed by the High Court in a writ petition unless the High Court specifically issues a direction. However, the court emphasizes that orders passed by any court must be honored and complied with by the party concerned. The court issues directions for the Registrar to issue a certificate for recovery of costs awarded in the writ petition.

In the third case, the court has ordered the issuance of a certificate for the recovery of costs awarded in a specific case. The certificate, along with a copy of the judgment, will be sent to a lower court for execution of the payment order. The respondent must file an execution petition within six months, and the lower court will follow the procedure for executing a civil court decree. The lower court will certify the result of the execution to the High Court. The Civil Revision Petition is disposed of, and no costs are ordered. A copy of the order will be sent to the Committee for framing High Court Rules and High Court Service Rules.

In summary, these court orders deal with the execution of orders passed in writ petitions and the recovery of costs awarded in specific cases.
