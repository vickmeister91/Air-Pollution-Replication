The court orders discussed in this text relate to a writ petition filed by the Sutru Suzhal Makkal Sangam under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to lock and seal Sri Annapoorana Sri Gowrishankar Hotel (P) Limited, Coimbatore, for running without proper permission from the local authority. The petitioner claimed that the hotel was causing danger to public health and disrupting traffic.

The court considered the petitioner's credentials and the seriousness of the information provided before deciding on the case. The court emphasized the need for caution in using public interest litigation as a tool for personal gain or political motives. The court warned against frivolous petitions and imposters who masquerade as crusaders of justice. The court stressed the importance of verifying facts and ensuring that petitions are genuinely in the public interest. The court urged the weeding out of petitions that are not truly in the public interest and warned against the abuse of the public interest litigation jurisdiction.

The court order discussed the misuse of public interest litigations (PILs) in Indian courts. The court noted that while PILs were created to help the poor and weaker sections of society, they have become a tool for busybodies, meddlesome interlopers, and those with ulterior motives to file frivolous and vexatious petitions. The court emphasized that PILs should only be used for genuine public wrongs or injuries and not for personal gain or private motives. The court also laid down guidelines for filing PILs, including disclosing personal interests, providing details of the persons for whose benefit the PIL is filed, and giving an undertaking to pay costs if the petition is found to be intended for personal gain or oblique motive.

The court dismissed the petitioner's claims that a hotel in Coimbatore is running without building and planning permission, as there is no evidence to support the claim. The court found that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their claims and had wasted judicial time. The court cited various decisions to explain when a writ of mandamus can be issued and emphasized that the petitioner must establish a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is sought.

The court ordered the petitioner to pay costs of Rs.10,000/- to the Commissioner, Coimbatore Corporation, failing which the District Collector, Coimbatore, is directed to take actions for recovery under the Tamil Nadu Revenue Recovery Act, 1864. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in petitions and the need for caution and scrutiny when it comes to public interest litigations. The court warns against the abuse of the public interest litigation jurisdiction and stresses the importance of ensuring that petitions are genuinely in the public interest.
