The court order pertains to four civil revision petitions filed by Sadhu Singh and others and Mahesh Kumar and another. The petitions were filed to set aside an impugned order/judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge (Fast Track Court), Bathinda. The plaintiffs had brought a suit for grant of permanent injunction against the defendants on the grounds that they were co-sharers in joint possession of land measuring 69 kanals 1 marla situated within revenue limits of village Bhucho Kalan, Tehsil and District Bathinda. The defendants had threatened to dispossess the plaintiffs from the suit land to carve out a colony and raise construction on specific and more valuable part of the joint khata of the land without getting it partitioned.

The trial court had disposed of the application observing that prima facie both the parties are established to be co-sharers of the suit property, therefore no injunction can be granted against the co-sharers. The impugned order was set aside by the Additional District Judge (Fast Track Court), Bathinda, which left the plaintiffs aggrieved and they filed the civil revision petitions. The court examined the case and found that the petitioners were unnecessarily aggrieved.

The court order states that the petitioners in the case are feeling unnecessarily aggrieved as the trial court had already observed that the parties are co-sharers in the suit property and no injunction can be granted against co-sharers. The plaintiffs had withdrawn an earlier suit for declaration and permanent injunction, and the proper remedy for them was to approach the revenue authorities seeking partition. The court also dismissed an application by the defendants seeking rejection of the plaint, stating that objections can be taken care of during the trial. The order cannot be termed as perverse or arbitrary, and the revisionist's objections can be addressed during the trial.

The court order cites several cases in support of the contentions made, but ultimately finds no merit in the case at hand and dismisses it. The order was issued on December 9th, 2019.
