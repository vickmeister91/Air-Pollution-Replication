The court order in question pertains to a case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Prasenjit Ganguly and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. The accused had filed an application to place certain documents on record and for consideration of the court for framing of charges. The accused claimed that the CBI had initiated an investigation without probing the genuineness of the office bearers of the society. The accused also alleged that the Investigating Officer (IO) had ignored their documents and falsely implicated them.

However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the accused could not produce any material at the stage of framing of charges. The court relied on the law laid down by the Full Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in D N Padhy's judgment. The court held that the accused had failed to produce any material to show that the investigation was mala fide or that the IO had ignored their documents. The court further held that the accused could not be allowed to produce any material at the stage of framing of charges, as the same would amount to a mini-trial.

The court also observed that the accused had not challenged the validity of the investigation before the appropriate forum. The court held that the accused could not be permitted to challenge the investigation at the stage of framing of charges. The court further held that the accused could raise their contentions before the trial court during the trial.

The accused can raise their contentions before the trial court during the trial.
