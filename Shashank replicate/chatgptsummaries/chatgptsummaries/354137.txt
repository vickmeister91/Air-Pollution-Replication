The Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board had appealed a decision to grant a compensation claim of Rs. 25,000 under the Public Liability Insurance Act to the parents of a boy who died due to electrocution from an electric wire lying by the side of the road. The Board argued that the Act only applies to those handling hazardous substances and that the liability of 'no fault' cannot apply to the Board. However, the court ruled that electricity is a hazardous substance and that the Board is liable under the principle of strict liability.

The court also noted that the compensation amount is meager but that the Act allows for claims for damages under other laws. The appeals were dismissed, and the Collector was ordered to disburse the compensation amount if it had not already been done.

The case highlights the importance of strict liability in cases of hazardous substances. The principle of strict liability holds that a person or organization is liable for any harm caused by their actions or products, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. This principle is particularly important in cases involving hazardous substances, where the potential for harm is high.

In this case, the court recognized that electricity is a hazardous substance and that the State Electricity Board is liable under the principle of strict liability. The court's decision is significant because it establishes that organizations handling electricity are responsible for any harm caused by their actions, even if they were not negligent.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of compensation for victims of hazardous substances. The compensation amount in this case was meager, but the court noted that the Public Liability Insurance Act allows for claims for damages under other laws. This means that victims of hazardous substances can seek compensation under other laws, in addition to the Public Liability Insurance Act.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for victims of hazardous substances. The principle of strict liability ensures that organizations handling hazardous substances are held responsible for any harm caused by their actions, and the availability of compensation under other laws provides victims with additional avenues for seeking redress.
