The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues of pollution and contamination of water canals in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. The first court order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by Darshan Singh against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court also noted that one of the related cases, WP No. 718/2009, had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The second court order concerns the pollution and contamination of the Ganga Nahar Canal and its distributories. The State was directed to come up with short and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this direction. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the transfer of records of WP No. 718/2009 to them. The court also directed the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present on the next date of hearing.

The third court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for the purpose. The compliance report filed by the State Government revealed that some encroachers had approached the Hon'ble High Court, apprehending that steps would be taken for their removal. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal.

The fourth court order directs the state to comply with the directions of the Tribunal regarding the removal of structures causing contamination of canal water and to file a compliance report. The Chief Engineer's affidavit reveals that the action taken by the government falls short of what was required, and the court gives the state another opportunity to file a response. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal to provide complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the state's action should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases related to environmental protection. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The final court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy, if that is efficacious. In the case at hand, the court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Such application/representation shall be filed by 31st December, 2016. Till 31st December, 2016, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s).
