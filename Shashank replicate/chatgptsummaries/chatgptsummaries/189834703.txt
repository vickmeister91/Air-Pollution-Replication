The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had raided seven premises of crusher units and found that iron ore was being crushed without proper consent. The Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners for contravention of various acts, including the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and S.C. & S.T. (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. However, the court order quashed the order taking cognizance of the offenses punishable under these acts against the petitioners.

The court found that the Junior Environment Engineer who filed the complaint was not authorized by the Board to lodge the case for contravention of the provision of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Additionally, the person who lodged the case was not competent to lodge the case for contravention of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Therefore, the court found that the complaint was not filed by the authorized person and hence, the order taking cognizance of the offenses was quashed.

Furthermore, the court also found that there was no allegation of the commission of offenses under certain sections of the Indian Penal Code and S.C. & S.T. (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Therefore, the court order quashed the order taking cognizance of the offenses punishable under these acts against the petitioners.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had raided seven premises of crusher units and found that iron ore was being crushed without proper consent. However, the court found that the complaint was not filed by the authorized person and there was no allegation of the commission of offenses under certain sections of the Indian Penal Code and S.C. & S.T. (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Therefore, the court order quashed the order taking cognizance of the offenses punishable under various acts against the petitioners.
