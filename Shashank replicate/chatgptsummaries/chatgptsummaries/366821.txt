The court order in question pertains to two criminal revision petitions that were filed under Section 397 and 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). These petitions were filed against an order made in C.M.P.No.148 of 2005 in C.C.No.123 of 2002 and C.M.P.No.149 of 2005 in C.C.No.122 of 2002 respectively on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.IV, Salem.

The case was taken on file on the complaint given by the revision petitioners under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioners had filed a petition under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. to recall a prosecution witness for the purpose of marking a document. However, the trial court had negatived the plea of the revision petitioners.

The High Court, on the other hand, allowed the Criminal Revision Petitions, permitting the petitioner to recall the prosecution witness, so as to mark only the document, which is available on the file of the trial court. The trial court was directed to dispose of the case within three months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order.
