The National Green Tribunal recently heard two appeals against orders passed by the Appellate Authority, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, regarding the establishment of brick kilns near mango orchards. The appellants claimed that the brick kilns were causing pollution and damaging their mango trees, while the respondents argued that they were located beyond the prescribed distance from the orchards and human habitation. The Tribunal found that there was no threat to the mango trees and that the reports submitted by both parties were consistent in terms of distance from the brick kilns.

The court order states that there is no evidence to suggest that the brick kilns in question are causing damage to mango trees. However, the court has noticed that there are other mango orchards in close proximity to the brick kilns and has ordered a fresh report to be conducted. The court has also issued directions for compliance before renewing the consent to operate in favor of the brick kiln owners. The appeal has been disposed of subject to these directions.
