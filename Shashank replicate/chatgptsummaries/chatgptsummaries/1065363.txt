The Gujarat High Court recently received a Misc. Criminal Application from Gujarat Ambuja Proteins Limited, requesting the quashing and setting aside of an order passed by the learned JMFC Kadi in Criminal Case No. 579/90. The order in question had revoked an earlier order of granting exemption to the accused and had issued non-bailable warrants against them. The case involved allegations of pollution by the accused-factory, and the court found that the case had been unnecessarily adjourned multiple times, reflecting poorly on the court's handling of pollution cases.

The Gujarat High Court, in its ruling, directed the learned Magistrate to proceed with the trial, giving it top-most priority and preferably deciding the case on or before 30-6-1997. The court also directed the learned Magistrate to inform the court of the case's disposition by the specified date and to affix a copy of the notice on the notice board and give a copy to the complainant to serve on the accused.

The case in question highlights the importance of timely and efficient handling of pollution cases. The court's decision to direct the learned Magistrate to proceed with the trial and to give it top-most priority reflects the court's commitment to ensuring that justice is served in a timely and efficient manner.

The court's decision also serves as a reminder to all stakeholders involved in pollution cases, including the accused, the complainant, and the court, of the importance of taking these cases seriously and ensuring that they are handled in a timely and efficient manner. Failure to do so can result in unnecessary delays and can reflect poorly on the court's handling of such cases.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's ruling in the case of Gujarat Ambuja Proteins Limited serves as a reminder of the importance of timely and efficient handling of pollution cases. The court's decision to direct the learned Magistrate to proceed with the trial and to give it top-most priority reflects the court's commitment to ensuring that justice is served in a timely and efficient manner. It is hoped that all stakeholders involved in pollution cases will take note of this ruling and will work together to ensure that such cases are handled in a timely and efficient manner.
