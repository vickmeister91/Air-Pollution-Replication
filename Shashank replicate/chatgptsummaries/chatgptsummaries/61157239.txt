The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Kunnumbran Sreedharan, who owns certain lands purchased under the ceiling provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. Sreedharan filed an application seeking benefits of Section 7(E) of the Act, which was introduced by an amendment in 2005, for excluding the land from surrender as excess land. The application was dismissed, and Sreedharan approached the court.

The court held that the Taluk Land Board is duty-bound to consider Sreedharan's application under Section 85(8) of the Act in the light of Section 7(E), without reference to a communication issued by the Secretary of the Land Board. The court also expressed its concerns about the effect of Section 7(E) on the people of Kerala and urged the state to consider the matter.

Section 7(E) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act has been criticized by the court for diluting the advantage obtained by the state through the Act, resulting in excess land being retained by violators of the law instead of being distributed to landless people. The court hopes that the government will take appropriate action to discourage violation of the law and send a message that it does not pay to violate the law.

The court also expressed hope that its recommendations will not be ignored, as was the case with a previous recommendation regarding the implementation of Section 4A of the Payment of Gratuity Act. The court's concerns about the implementation of Section 7(E) are rooted in the fact that the Act was introduced to address the issue of landlessness in Kerala, which was a major problem at the time.

The court's order is significant because it highlights the need for the government to take action to ensure that the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act are implemented effectively. The Act was introduced to address the issue of landlessness in Kerala, and it is important that its provisions are not diluted or ignored.

The court's order also highlights the need for the government to take action to discourage violation of the law. The court's concerns about the effect of Section 7(E) on the people of Kerala are valid, and it is important that the government takes steps to ensure that the provisions of the Act are not misused.

Overall, the court's order is a reminder of the importance of effective implementation of laws and regulations. The Kerala Land Reforms Act was introduced to address a major problem in the state, and it is important that its provisions are implemented effectively to ensure that the issue of landlessness is addressed. The court's order is a step in the right direction, and it is hoped that the government will take appropriate action to address the concerns raised by the court.
