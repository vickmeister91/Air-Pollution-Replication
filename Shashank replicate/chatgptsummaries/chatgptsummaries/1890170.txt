The Gujarat High Court recently issued an order in Special Civil Application No. 5842 of 2011, which involved PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd as the petitioner and Gujarat Pollution Control Board and others as the respondents. The court directed the board to take a final decision and pass a reasoned order within three months. If any adverse decision is taken or stay is vacated, the petitioner can move the court for appropriate relief. The writ petition was disposed of with this observation.

The case involved a dispute between PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board over the latter's decision to revoke the petitioner's consent to operate its plant in the state. The petitioner had argued that the board's decision was arbitrary and without any basis in law. The board, on the other hand, had contended that the petitioner had violated various environmental norms and had failed to comply with the conditions of its consent to operate.

The court noted that the board had not passed a reasoned order while revoking the petitioner's consent to operate. It observed that the board had merely stated that the petitioner had violated various environmental norms without specifying the nature of the violations or the evidence on which the conclusion was based. The court held that such an order was not sustainable in law and directed the board to pass a reasoned order within three months.

The court also observed that the petitioner had a right to challenge any adverse decision taken by the board or any order vacating the stay on the revocation of its consent to operate. It directed the petitioner to approach the court for appropriate relief in such a situation.

The court's order is significant as it underscores the importance of passing reasoned orders while taking administrative decisions. It also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to follow due process and provide adequate evidence to support their decisions. The order is likely to have implications for other cases where regulatory bodies have revoked consents to operate without passing reasoned orders.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's order in Special Civil Application No. 5842 of 2011 is a reminder of the importance of due process and reasoned decision-making in administrative matters. It is a welcome development for businesses and individuals who have been adversely affected by arbitrary decisions of regulatory bodies. The order is likely to have far-reaching implications for the functioning of regulatory bodies and the protection of the rights of businesses and individuals.
