The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case filed by M/S Rahul Ion Tech Ltd. seeking to quash the summoning order taking cognizance dated 22.04.2019 in Criminal Complaint No.2900/2018 by the Ld. Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution), Lucknow, and all consequential proceedings emanating therefrom. The complaint was filed in compliance with the general directions given in Para 9 of the order dated 08.08.2018 passed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No. 231 of 2014 (Doaba Paryavaran Samiti Vs. State of U.P. & Ors.).

The case pertains to the alleged violation of environmental norms by M/S Rahul Ion Tech Ltd. The company was accused of discharging untreated effluent into the environment, which was causing pollution and posing a threat to public health. The complaint was filed under Section 15 and Section 16 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 431 of the Indian Penal Code.

During the hearing, the court found that the provisions of Section 21 of the Act, 1974 were not complied with at the time of taking samples. Section 21 of the Act, 1974 deals with the power of the pollution control board to take samples of effluent or sewage for analysis. The court observed that the samples were not taken in the presence of the accused or their representative, and the procedure prescribed under Section 21 was not followed.

The court also noted that the report of the laboratory where the samples were sent for analysis did not mention the date and time of receipt of the samples. The court held that this was a serious lapse on the part of the pollution control board and the investigating agency.

Based on these observations, the court stayed further proceedings of Complaint Case No. 2900 of 2018 until the next date of listing. The court also directed the pollution control board to strictly comply with the provisions of Section 21 of the Act, 1974 in future cases.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions of the law while investigating cases of environmental violations. It also underscores the need for strict compliance with the guidelines and directions issued by the National Green Tribunal and other regulatory bodies.

The case is likely to have wider implications for other cases of environmental violations and could set a precedent for future cases. It is also a reminder to companies and industries to ensure that they comply with environmental norms and regulations to avoid legal action and penalties.
