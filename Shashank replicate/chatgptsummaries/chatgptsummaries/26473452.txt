The court order in question relates to a case between Mondelez India Foods Limited and the state of Madhya Pradesh. The issue at hand is a notice that was issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. According to the respondents' counsel, this notice is going to be withdrawn.

The petitioners in this case have requested permission to withdraw their petitions, with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has granted this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioners are also allowed to take recourse of law afresh, if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to conserve India's rich biodiversity. The Act provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, as well as the National Biodiversity Authority at the national level. The Act also provides for the regulation of access to biological resources and associated knowledge, and the sharing of benefits arising from their use.

In this case, it appears that the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act has been withdrawn. Section 7 of the Act provides for the regulation of access to biological resources and associated knowledge. It requires any person or organization seeking to access biological resources or associated knowledge to obtain the prior approval of the National Biodiversity Authority or the State Biodiversity Board, as the case may be.

It is not clear from the court order why the notice was issued in the first place, or why it is now being withdrawn. However, it is possible that the notice was issued because Mondelez India Foods Limited was seeking to access biological resources or associated knowledge in Madhya Pradesh, and had not obtained the necessary approvals.

The fact that the petitioners have been granted permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed suggests that this case may not be entirely resolved. It is possible that the petitioners may choose to file afresh if they are not satisfied with the outcome of the withdrawal of the notice.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 in regulating access to India's rich biodiversity. It also underscores the need for organizations to obtain the necessary approvals before accessing biological resources or associated knowledge. While the reasons for the withdrawal of the notice in this case are not clear, it is important for all stakeholders to comply with the provisions of the Act in order to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of India's biodiversity.
