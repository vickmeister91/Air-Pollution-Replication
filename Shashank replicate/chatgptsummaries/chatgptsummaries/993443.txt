The court order in question pertains to a case where a truck was seized by the Forester of Wild Life Protection Act and the owner of the vehicle filed an application under Section 457 of Cr.P.C. for its release. The application was rejected by the learned S.D.J.M., Nilgiri on the ground that it was premature as no case was instituted in the Court of learned Magistrate.

The petitioner filed a writ application before the court challenging both the orders, and the court directed the Authorized Officer under the Wild Life Protection Act to register a case and consider the application for interim release of the vehicle. However, the Authorized Officer disposed of the petition stating that there is no provision under the Act to initiate a proceeding for confiscation and there is also no provision for interim release of the vehicle.

The petitioner again approached the learned Magistrate under Section 457 Cr.P.C., but the petition was rejected. The court set aside the impugned order and directed the learned Magistrate to reconsider the application afresh in the light of the law laid down in a previous case.
