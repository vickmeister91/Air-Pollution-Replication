The Bombay High Court recently heard a case filed by the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association against the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and the Jeevan Jagruti Trust. The association sought to quash a letter from the respondents and prevent them from interfering with the slaughtering of sheep and goats by licensed members of the association. The court heard arguments from both sides and separated the case from a related public interest litigation. The association is a group of butchers and meat vendors in Mumbai, and the case relates to the shifting of animal slaughter operations to the Deonar abattoir in 1973.

The court order pertains to a petition filed by the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association against the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (MCGM) and others. The petitioners were granted individual licenses to slaughter sheep and goats outside the Deonar abattoir in 1991, subject to certain conditions. However, in July 1991, the MCGM informed the petitioners that the permission granted was on an experimental basis for three months only. The court notes that there were some problems regarding waste and waste disposal, but ignores a generalized allegation made by the petitioners against unnamed persons.

The court order pertains to the revocation of licenses granted to suburban licensees to remove sheep and goats from Deonar Abattoir to their respective shops. The permission was granted for three months only up to 3rd August 1991, and it was experimental. The court was reviewing a challenge to the withdrawal of the letter of 20th July 1991. The court referred to previous orders and statutory provisions, including the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888, which mandates that slaughter of animals will take place only in a slaughter-house established by the Municipal Corporation or a licensed slaughter-house.

The court order discusses various sections of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act related to markets and slaughterhouses. It states that all markets and slaughterhouses maintained by the Corporation shall be called "municipal markets" or "municipal slaughterhouses", while all others shall be deemed private. The Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation can close any municipal market or slaughterhouse with the sanction of the Corporation and the State Government. Section 401 requires a license from the Commissioner to sell or expose for sale any animal, elegant or exotic bird, or fish. Private markets and slaughterhouses cannot be kept open without a license, and Section 403 outlines the conditions for obtaining a license. The Commissioner may suspend the license of a trader, owner of a private market, or abattoir for not keeping the premises clean or disposing of trade refuse properly. Any animal or fish found in possession of a person contravening the provisions of Section 403 may be seized and sold, with the proceeds belonging to the Corporation.

The court order discusses various sections of the MMC Act related to the regulation of markets and slaughterhouses, including the prohibition of selling animals for human consumption in unauthorized private markets. The court expects the Municipal Corporation to provide a comprehensive affidavit detailing their compliance with these regulations and other relevant statutes. The deadline for the affidavit is set for November 2, 2018.

The court order requires the Municipal Corporation to provide regulation of slaughterhouses and tanneries, and to construct and maintain a slaughterhouse. The court expects a further affidavit from a high-ranking officer indicating the steps taken to move the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra to establish a slaughterhouse. The court also notes that illegal slaughter and sale of animal beef is taking place in public areas and calls on the State to ensure that rules and regulations are not violated. The court discourages multiple PILs on the same issue and expects petitioners to be aware of pending Supreme Court proceedings.

The court order discusses a case involving the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the MCGM. The court notes that there is nothing pending in the Supreme Court or in this court regarding the case. The court expects the State Government to guide and control all Municipal Corporations and Panchayats in the state to prevent pollution and ensure public health. The court also analyzes several affidavits filed on record, including one from the General Manager of Deonar abattoir denying the Petitioners' right to any license or permission to slaughter goats or sheep attached to their respective shops. Another affidavit references the 2001 Slaughter House Rules and states that the Deonar abattoir is the only recognized slaughterhouse within the MCGM jurisdiction.

The court order discusses various affidavits submitted by both the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the MCGM regarding the legality of chamber slaughtering activity. The MCGM argues that the activity poses a danger to public health and is not in compliance with statutory obligations. The Khatik Association argues that the Deonar Abattoir is inadequate and that its members should be allowed to continue chamber slaughtering until necessary facilities are provided. The court is tasked with weighing these arguments and determining the legality of chamber slaughtering activity.

The court order discusses the actions taken by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to combat illegal slaughter and sale of meat. The MCGM has employed Market Inspectors and Head Inspectors to take swift action against illegal activities, and license holders have been directed to dump waste only in MCGM waste collecting trucks. The Deonar Abattoir is the only authorized slaughterhouse for the sale
