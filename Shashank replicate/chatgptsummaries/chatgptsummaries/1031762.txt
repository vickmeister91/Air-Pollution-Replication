In recent court orders, the Animal and Environment Legal Defence Fund filed a petition challenging the granting of 305 fishing permits to tribals in the Pench National Park Tiger Reserve. The permits were issued in lieu of the tribals' traditional fishing rights, which the petitioner argued were unwarranted. The court acknowledged the importance of preserving the fragile ecology of the forest area and protecting the Tiger Reserve, but also recognized the right of the tribals to earn their livelihood. 

The court issued several conditions for properly implementing the fishing permits, including limiting the number of permit holders, prohibiting access to certain areas, and maintaining a daily record of activities. The court also directed the State of Madhya Pradesh to provide personnel and vehicles for monitoring the activities of the permit holders. This decision was made to ensure that the tribals could continue to earn their livelihood while also protecting the environment and wildlife in the area.
