The Patna High Court recently heard two cases filed by M/S Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd. against the State of Bihar and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The company sought to quash the proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision based on the evidence presented.

The court order states that the accused, M/s Bharat Sugar Mills, had been granted consent for discharge of trade effluents until 1986, but had not obtained valid consent for the period between 1987 and March 1990. The court ruled that no person who was not associated with the company at the relevant time could be criminally prosecuted. The court also ruled that since the then Executive President of the company had died, no sentence of imprisonment could be legally passed against the company, but the vicarious liability of the company would continue for the payment of fines. The court further ruled that allowing the proceedings to continue after 22 years would be violative of the principle of speedy trial, and therefore quashed the proceedings.
