The court recently rejected the third application for bail by Jagdish Shakya, who was arrested for possession of flesh and hairs of wild boar in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The defense argued that there was no substantive evidence against the applicant, but the prosecution argued that the confessional statement of the co-accused was relevant under Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. The court found that it was not a fit case for grant of bail and rejected the application.

Jagdish Shakya was arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act, which prohibits the possession of flesh and hairs of wild boar. He had applied for bail three times, but all his applications were rejected by the court. The defense argued that there was no substantive evidence against the applicant, but the prosecution argued that the confessional statement of the co-accused was relevant under Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act.

The court found that the confessional statement of the co-accused was admissible under Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. This section allows the admission of a confession made by a co-accused if it is made in the presence of the accused and relates to the same offence. The court also found that the confessional statement was relevant to the case and could be used as evidence against the applicant.

The defense argued that the confessional statement was not reliable and should not be used as evidence against the applicant. However, the court found that the statement was made voluntarily and was not obtained through coercion or inducement. The court also found that the statement was consistent with the other evidence in the case.

The defense also argued that there was no substantive evidence against the applicant. However, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against the applicant. The court noted that the applicant was found in possession of the flesh and hairs of wild boar, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court also noted that the applicant had not provided a satisfactory explanation for his possession of the items.

The court found that it was not a fit case for grant of bail and rejected the application. The court noted that the offence was serious and that there was a possibility of the applicant tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses if he was released on bail. The court also noted that the applicant had already applied for bail twice before and that his previous applications had been rejected.

In conclusion, the court rejected the third application for bail by Jagdish Shakya, who was arrested for possession of flesh and hairs of wild boar in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court found that the confessional statement of the co-accused was admissible under Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act and that there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against the applicant. The court also found that it was not a fit case for grant of bail and rejected the application.
