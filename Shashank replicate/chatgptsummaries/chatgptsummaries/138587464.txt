The Patna High Court recently issued two orders related to environmental protection and prevention of water pollution. In the first case, Om Prakash Dhanuka approached the court to quash an order summoning him under Sections 277 and 278 of the Indian Penal Code for fouling water of public spring or reservoir and making the atmosphere noxious to health. The court found that there are special enactments for Protection of Environment and Prevention of Water, and the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate of the concerned district headquarter has been authorized as Special Judicial Magistrate for taking cognizance of the offence and trial. Therefore, the impugned order was quashed, and the application was allowed.

In the second case, the court order from Sri Ashok Kumar Gupta, Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Sitamarhi, in Complaint Case No.C1/430/2004, T.R. No.2483 of 2006, has been quashed and the application is allowed. The order was issued on January 4th, 2012 by Rajendra Kumar Mishra, J at the Patna High Court in Patna.

The court's decision in the first case highlights the importance of special enactments for environmental protection and prevention of water pollution. The court found that the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate of the concerned district headquarter has been authorized as Special Judicial Magistrate for taking cognizance of the offence and trial. This means that there are specific laws and regulations in place to address environmental issues, and that these laws are enforced by specialized judicial officers.

The court's decision in the second case is not clear from the summary provided. However, it is likely that the case also involved environmental protection or water pollution, given the context of the first case.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of environmental protection and prevention of water pollution in India. The court's decisions show that there are specific laws and regulations in place to address these issues, and that these laws are enforced by specialized judicial officers. This is a positive step towards ensuring that India's natural resources are protected for future generations.
