The Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Block's Manufactures Association filed a petition under section 226 of the Constitution of India to issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to make it mandatory to use Fly Ash Bricks in the Melakottaiyur Project. The project was for the construction of multi-storied residential flats, numbering 2673 flats, to house DSPs/Inspector of Police/Sub-Inspector of Police/Head Constables/Constables on 47.6 Acres of land situate at Melakottaiyur, Chennai 600 127. 

The petitioner argued that the use of fly ash bricks would not only be cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. The use of fly ash bricks would also reduce the carbon footprint of the project. The petitioner further argued that the use of fly ash bricks was mandatory under the Fly Ash Notification, 1999, issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The notification mandates the use of fly ash bricks in construction projects within a 100-kilometer radius of a thermal power plant.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory under the Fly Ash Notification, 1999. The respondents further argued that the use of fly ash bricks would increase the cost of the project and that the project had already been completed. The respondents also argued that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition as the petitioner was not a party to the project.

The court, after hearing both parties, dismissed the petition. The court held that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory under the Fly Ash Notification, 1999. The court further held that the project had already been completed, and the question of directing the sixth respondent to use fly ash bricks for those flats did not arise. The court also held that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition as the petitioner was not a party to the project.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory under the Fly Ash Notification, 1999. The court also considered the fact that the project had already been completed, and the question of directing the sixth respondent to use fly ash bricks for those flats did not arise. The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition as the petitioner was not a party to the project.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Block's Manufactures Association. The court held that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory under the Fly Ash Notification, 1999. The court also held that the project had already been completed, and the question of directing the sixth respondent to use fly ash bricks for those flats did not arise. The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition as the petitioner was not a party to the project.
