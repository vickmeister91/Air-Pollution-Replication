The first court order pertains to a case where the petitioner sought to quash an investigation against them under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, due to non-compliance with Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act. The petitioner argued that as a Joint Secretary level officer, the CBI was required to obtain prior approval from the Central Government before proceeding with the investigation. The CBI argued that they were not aware of the petitioner's status and only obtained approval after it was discovered. The court held that the investigation was illegal due to the non-compliance with Section 6A and that ex post-facto approval did not ratify the earlier investigation.

The court held that the CBI had exceeded its jurisdiction in lodging the FIR without any specific direction from the court. The investigation prior to approval cannot be quashed piecemeal, and investigation is defined as the ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court quashed the impugned FIR and any investigation pursuant to it. The order also discusses the difference between "approval," "consent," and "sanction."

The second court order outlines the steps that must be taken in a police investigation, including proceeding to the scene, ascertaining facts, arresting suspects, collecting evidence, and forming an opinion on whether to charge the accused. The responsibility for each step lies with the officer in charge of the police station, and there is no provision for delegation. The order also discusses the consequences of an illegal investigation and the circumstances under which a trial can be set aside. The court ultimately dismisses the petition in question.
