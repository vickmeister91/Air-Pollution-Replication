The Madras High Court recently issued several court orders in relation to various writ petitions filed by different parties. These orders cover a range of issues, including police protection, construction permissions, and building renewals.

One of the court orders involves two writ petitions filed by M/s. Supreme Poultry Private Limited. The first petition sought police protection for workers and properties in Kodanthur Village, Karur Taluk, while the second petition challenged an order passed by the Panchayat of Kodanthur Village Panchayat, Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District, and sought the renewal of permission for construction. The court heard both sides and decided that the disposal of the second writ petition would also dispose of the first writ petition. The court also provided a detailed background of the case, including the various permissions and cancellations granted to the petitioner/company.

In another court order, the court dismissed a writ petition and upheld the Pollution Control Board's consent to establish a unit. However, the court also stated that the Panchayat Union has the right to cancel or modify the permission granted by the executive authority in accordance with the law. The court allowed two writ appeals and dismissed two others. The petitioner's request for an extension of building permission was rejected as they did not apply for renewal 30 days prior to the expiry of the building permission. The court also dismissed a writ petition for police protection.

The court's decision in the first set of writ petitions filed by M/s. Supreme Poultry Private Limited is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining proper permissions and renewals for construction projects. The court noted that the petitioner had obtained various permissions for construction, but these had been cancelled due to non-compliance with certain conditions. The court also noted that the petitioner had not applied for renewal of the permission within the stipulated time frame. The court's decision to dispose of the first writ petition along with the second writ petition highlights the interconnectedness of these issues and the need for proper compliance with regulations.

In the second court order, the court's decision to uphold the Pollution Control Board's consent to establish a unit is significant as it underscores the importance of environmental regulations. The court's statement that the Panchayat Union has the right to cancel or modify the permission granted by the executive authority in accordance with the law highlights the need for proper compliance with regulations and the importance of local governance in enforcing these regulations.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of proper compliance with regulations and the need for local governance to enforce these regulations. They also underscore the interconnectedness of various issues, such as construction permissions and police protection, and the need for a holistic approach to addressing these issues.
