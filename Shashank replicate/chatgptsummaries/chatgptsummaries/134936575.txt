The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Naseer Joinery Laloo against the Regional Director S.P.C.B & Ors. The petitioner runs a wood-based industrial unit and has been facing complaints from his maternal uncle, who has filed complaints with the Pollution Control Board (PCB) stating that the unit is causing serious noise pollution. The PCB has issued two notices to the petitioner, directing him to take necessary remedial measures and submit compliance within a time frame, failing which legal action would be taken.

The petitioner has filed a writ petition seeking time to introduce remedial measures in the shape of replacement of existing tin sheets by brick walling after obtaining permission from the Srinagar Municipal Corporation. The court has granted the petitioner two weeks' time to approach the Regional Director, J&K State Pollution Control Board with an application and request appropriate instructions from the Authority as to what are the pollution control methods to be adopted and accordingly implemented. The petitioner shall also submit an application before the SMC for grant of permission for taking up construction so as to enable the industrial unit to comply with the suggestions/directions of PCB.

The court order requires the petitioner to comply with Pollution Control laws and allows parties to pursue a civil suit on its merits. If the petitioner does not apply for necessary permits within a specified time frame, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) can take appropriate action. The private respondents can raise objections and be heard by authorities. The writ petition is disposed of, and interim directions are vacated. The order was issued on May 18th, 2017, by Judge Ramalingam Sudhakar in Srinagar.
