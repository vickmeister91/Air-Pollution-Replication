The court order pertains to multiple cases involving various parties, including a public interest litigation and writ petitions. The cases involve disputes over the construction of sugar factories, the grant of licenses and certificates, and the minimum distance between sugar factories prescribed by the government. The court provides a chronology of events and lists the parties involved in each case.

In one case, the court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, provided they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji ultimately receiving one and beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and others, leading to a court order restraining Audumbarraoji from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained.

In another case, the court discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was made earlier than Lokshakti's, and therefore the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting it to Audumbarraoji and refusing it to Lokshakti. The court also addresses objections raised by Lokshakti regarding the authenticity of Audumbarraoji's application and the timing of the applications.

The court also considers a case involving the distance between sugar factories and the minimum distance prescribed by the government. The court ultimately concludes that a change in location for a sugar factory is permissible and should relate back to the date of the initial application. The court also discusses a circular regarding aerial distance certificates and the implementation of the Sugarcane Control Order.

In another case, the court discusses a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other. The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their factories at a different location from what was mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM.

The court also considers a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application for further amendment to their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM). The court determines that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement was to be treated as a fresh IEM registered in favor of Jaywant for the first time. The court also considers whether Audumbarraoji has taken effective steps within the stipulated period of two years from the date of IEM. The court finds that effective steps were taken by Audumbarraoji within the stipulated time.

In another case, the court had earlier restrained the construction of a sugar factory and directed the Collector to examine the permissions obtained by the factory owner. The Collector subsequently submitted a report stating that the necessary permissions had been obtained. However, the petitioner obtained another order restraining construction on the ground that the aerial distance certificate did not apply to the changed location of the factory.

The court ultimately dismisses all petitions and applications related to the cases, stating that the petitioners have no locus standi or legal right to object to the grant of permissions. The court has disposed of all petitions and applications related to the cases, and the petitioners have requested a stay on the judgment and order, which has been granted for a period of three weeks to allow them to approach the Apex Court.

Overall, the court order provides a detailed overview of the various cases and disputes related to the construction of sugar factories and the grant of licenses and certificates. The court considers arguments from both sides and makes decisions based on the evidence presented. While some cases are dismissed, others are allowed to proceed, and the court provides guidance on the implementation of various laws and regulations related to the sugar industry.
