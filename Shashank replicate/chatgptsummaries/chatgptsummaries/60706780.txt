The Delhi High Court has ordered that two civil writ petitions related to environmental issues, D.B. Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 9503/2012 and D.B. Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 8923/2012, will be transferred to the National Green Tribunal for further proceedings. The order was made in accordance with previous court orders and the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The petitions have been disposed of by the court.

The first petition, D.B. Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 9503/2012, was filed by a group of residents of Delhi seeking the closure of a waste-to-energy plant in Okhla, claiming that it was causing air pollution and health hazards. The second petition, D.B. Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 8923/2012, was filed by an NGO seeking the implementation of the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, in Delhi.

The court order comes after several years of legal battles over the two petitions. The National Green Tribunal had earlier taken up both petitions and had issued orders for the closure of the Okhla plant and the implementation of the waste management rules. However, the orders were challenged in the Delhi High Court, which had stayed the implementation of the orders.

The Delhi High Court has now transferred the petitions back to the National Green Tribunal for further proceedings. The court has directed the National Green Tribunal to dispose of the petitions within six months.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 to handle cases related to environmental issues. The tribunal has the power to hear cases related to air and water pollution, forest conservation, biodiversity, and climate change. The tribunal has been given the power to impose fines and penalties on polluters and to order the closure of polluting industries.

The transfer of the two petitions to the National Green Tribunal is a significant development in the fight against environmental pollution in Delhi. The Okhla waste-to-energy plant has been a major source of air pollution in the city, and its closure has been a long-standing demand of environmental activists and residents. The implementation of the waste management rules is also crucial for the proper disposal of waste in the city.

The Delhi High Court's order is a welcome move towards ensuring that environmental issues are addressed in a timely and effective manner. The National Green Tribunal has a proven track record of handling environmental cases and has been successful in imposing fines and penalties on polluters. The tribunal's swift action in disposing of the two petitions will be crucial in ensuring that the Okhla plant is closed and the waste management rules are implemented.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's order to transfer the two civil writ petitions related to environmental issues to the National Green Tribunal is a significant development in the fight against environmental pollution in Delhi. The transfer of the petitions is a welcome move towards ensuring that environmental issues are addressed in a timely and effective manner. The National Green Tribunal's proven track record of handling environmental cases and imposing fines and penalties on polluters will be crucial in ensuring that the Okhla plant is closed and the waste management rules are implemented. The court's direction to dispose of the petitions within six months is a positive step towards resolving the long-standing legal battles over the two petitions.
