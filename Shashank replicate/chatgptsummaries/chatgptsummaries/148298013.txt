The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed in 1991 regarding a dispute over eviction of tenants under The Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act 1953. The court allowed two applications by purchasers of shares of disputed property to be impleaded as party respondents. The petitioners had not paid rent for a certain period, and the court heard arguments from both sides regarding liability for eviction. The court cited relevant sections of the Act and previous cases to support its decision that the petitioners were liable for eviction due to non-payment of rent.

The court order discusses the conditions under which a tenant can be ejected by a landowner under the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953. Section 9 lists the conditions, and Section 14-A outlines the procedure for ejectment and recovery of arrears of rent. The court finds that the petitioners have not shown any restraint or fetter placed by the language of the statute, and the only question to be determined is regarding the default and its effect. The court cites a previous case to interpret the term "regularly" used in Section 9(i)(ii) to mean failure to pay rent without sufficient cause. The court also rejects the petitioners' plea of unawareness of the landlord's whereabouts.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "regularly" in relation to the penalty of ejectment for tenants who fail to pay rent. The High Court had taken a broad interpretation of the term, stating that one single default should not result in immediate ejectment. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the word "regularly" means payment of rent in a consistent manner without any breach or default, and that the legislature did not intend to condone even a single default without sufficient cause. The court acknowledges that the Act is meant to protect tenants, but also provides limited protection for landlords. Ultimately, the court concludes that the word "regular" connotes a consistent course of conduct without any break or breach, and that rent should be paid punctually without any default or laxity.

The court order states that the landlord has limited grounds for ejectment under section 9 of the Act, which is a safety valve for the limited rights left with the landlord. The language used in the various clauses of section 9 has to be construed so as to give real benefit to the landlord within the limited range that the section operates. In the instant case, the tenant has failed to pay rent regularly without sufficient cause, making them liable for ejectment. The court dismisses the petitions.
