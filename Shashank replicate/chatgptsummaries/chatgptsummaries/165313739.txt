The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Pawan Jadhav, who is accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that a wild boar was seized from Jadhav's possession. The court has allowed the bail application and directed Jadhav to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. Jadhav must also abide by all the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. If he is found to be indulging in a similar offense again, the bail granted by the court will stand automatically dismissed.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, or capturing of wild animals, and also prohibits the trade in wildlife and wildlife products. Violation of the Act can result in imprisonment and/or a fine.

In this case, Pawan Jadhav was accused of violating the Act by possessing a wild boar. The prosecution alleged that Jadhav had hunted the boar and was in possession of it without a valid permit. Jadhav, however, denied the allegations and claimed that he had found the boar injured and had taken it to his home to nurse it back to health.

Jadhav filed a bail application in court, seeking release from custody while the trial was ongoing. The court considered the application and granted bail to Jadhav, subject to certain conditions.

The court directed Jadhav to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. A personal bond is a promise made by the accused to appear in court when required, and to abide by all the conditions of the bail. A solvent surety is a person who guarantees to pay the bail amount if the accused fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of the bail.

The court also directed Jadhav to abide by all the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. provides for certain conditions that must be followed by an accused who has been granted bail. These conditions include appearing in court when required, not leaving the country without the court's permission, and not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

The court warned Jadhav that if he was found to be indulging in a similar offense again, the bail granted by the court would stand automatically dismissed. This means that if Jadhav is found to be violating the Wild Life Protection Act again, he will be taken back into custody and will not be granted bail again.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Pawan Jadhav, who is accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Jadhav must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount, and must abide by all the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. If he is found to be indulging in a similar offense again, the bail granted by the court will stand automatically dismissed.
