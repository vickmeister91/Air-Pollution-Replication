The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for dereservation of reserved forests and use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The cases involve quarry leases and mining operations, and the appellants in each case argue that they are entitled to renewals or permission to mine as a matter of right.

In the first case, the court held that the Act's primary purpose is to prevent deforestation and ecological imbalances, and the duty to the community takes precedence over the obligation to individuals. The appellants argued that they should be entitled to renewals as a matter of right, but the court dismissed the appeals and upheld the rejection of lease renewals. The court emphasized that the Act's interpretation must sub-serve the predominant purpose of preventing further deforestation.

In the second case, the court discussed the obligation of the State Government to obtain permission from the Central Government for dereservation of reserved forest and use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The appellants argued that they have invested large sums of money in mining operations and are entitled to renew their leases. However, the court ruled that the primary duty is to the community and preventing deforestation and ecological imbalances, and therefore renewals cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The court also discussed the interpretation of the words "may" and "shall" in relation to granting permission and concluded that the power is coupled with a duty in certain circumstances. The court cited previous cases to support its decision and ultimately ruled against the appellants.

In the third case, the court held that while permission is required before starting mining operations on virgin forest land, it is not necessary to seek prior approval from the Central Government for mining operations in a forest area that has already been broken up or cleared before the commencement of the Act. The court also imposed certain conditions on the mining operations, including not removing any standing trees without prior permission from the Central Government. The court emphasized that the interpretation of the Act must sub-serve the predominant purpose of preventing further deforestation. The court dismissed the appeals and directed the parties to bear their own costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, in preventing deforestation and ecological imbalances. The court emphasizes that the duty to the community takes precedence over the obligation to individuals, and that renewals or permission to mine cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The court also discusses the interpretation of the Act and the power and duty of the State Government and Central Government in granting permission for dereservation of reserved forests and use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court's decisions in these cases serve as a reminder of the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.
