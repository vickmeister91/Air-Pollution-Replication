The court recently granted bail to Kamlu, who was accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution claimed that during a raid, the forest police found flesh and a live tortoise in Kamlu's possession. However, Kamlu's counsel argued that he had not committed any offence and that the case was registered on a false report. The court took into account the fact that Kamlu had no prior criminal record and had been in jail since February 3, 2019, before granting him bail.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C., which allows for bail to be granted to an accused person who has been in custody for more than 60 days, provided that the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence for which he is charged. In Kamlu's case, the court found that there were indeed reasonable grounds to believe that he was not guilty of the charges against him.

The court also took into account Kamlu's personal circumstances, including his lack of criminal antecedents, before granting him bail. The court imposed certain conditions on Kamlu, including the requirement that he furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Kamlu was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court recognized that Kamlu had been in custody for a significant period of time and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he was not guilty of the charges against him. The court's decision to impose certain conditions on Kamlu was also reasonable, given the seriousness of the charges against him.
