In a recent court order, two individuals, Ranjan Sahu and Krishan Chand Ojha, were convicted for contravention of section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The case involved the recovery of various animal shells listed in Schedule-I and Schedule-IV of the Act, without any license or authority to possess or deal in them. The accused pleaded not guilty, but their statements and the testimony of prosecution witnesses proved their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The court rejected the accused's plea of innocence and lack of reliable testimony from independent public witnesses.

The court order states that the accused were found in possession of contraband shells specified in Schedule-I and Schedule-IV of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The accused's defense that they were falsely implicated due to enmity and animosity was not proven, and their admission of the recovery of the shells was considered as evidence. The accused failed to rebut the presumption of illegal possession, and therefore, both accused were convicted for the offense under the Act.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act has been amended several times to strengthen its provisions and to address emerging challenges in wildlife conservation.

In this case, the accused were found to be in possession of animal shells listed in Schedule-I and Schedule-IV of the Act, which are protected under the Act. The recovery of these shells without any license or authority to possess or deal in them is a clear violation of the Act. The accused's defense that they were falsely implicated due to enmity and animosity was not proven, and their admission of the recovery of the shells was considered as evidence. The court rejected the accused's plea of innocence and lack of reliable testimony from independent public witnesses.

The conviction of the accused sends a strong message that the illegal trade in wildlife and their products will not be tolerated. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, provides for stringent penalties for offenses related to wildlife conservation, including imprisonment and fines. The Act also provides for the forfeiture of any property used in the commission of the offense, which can act as a deterrent for future offenders.
