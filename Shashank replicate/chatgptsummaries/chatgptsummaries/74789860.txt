The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Shree Anwar Dastageer against the State of Karnataka, the Department of Mines and Geology, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the Deputy Commissioner of Belgaum District, the Mines and Geology Department, and the Hubli Electricity Supply Company. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and its rules.

The court dismissed the petition, citing the observation made by the Apex Court in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan & Others v. Union of India & Others ((2012) 8 SCC 326). The court granted the petitioner liberty to take an alternative remedy.

The case involved the petitioner's challenge to an order passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and its rules. The petitioner sought to quash the order on the grounds that it was arbitrary, illegal, and violative of the principles of natural justice.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, citing the observation made by the Apex Court in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan & Others v. Union of India & Others ((2012) 8 SCC 326). The Apex Court had observed that the High Court should not interfere with the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board unless there is a manifest error of law or the order is passed in violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court also noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them, which they could pursue. The court granted the petitioner liberty to take an alternative remedy.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the High Court should not interfere with the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board unless there is a manifest error of law or the order is passed in violation of the principles of natural justice. The decision also highlights the importance of pursuing alternative remedies when available.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and exhausting all available remedies before seeking relief from the courts. It also underscores the need for strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations to protect the health and well-being of citizens and the environment.
