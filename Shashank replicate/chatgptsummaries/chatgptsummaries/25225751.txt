Marikkar Pillai challenging the building permit, layout approval, consent to establish, and installation permission granted to Sulfikkar for the construction of an industrial shed. The petitioner alleges that the permits were obtained through misrepresentation or non-representation of facts and that the proposed unit would cause problems of nuisance, sound pollution, and health hazards.

The court notes that the petitioner has an effective and alternative remedy to approach the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions and the appellate forums provided under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. The court dismisses the writ petition, stating that it cannot be entertained as it would permit bypassing of all the statutory remedies. However, statutory remedies, if any available under law to the petitioner to challenge the permits, will stand reserved.
