The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the closure of a slaughterhouse in Raipur due to violations of pollution control laws, the rules and regulations related to the slaughter of animals and disposal of polluting matter, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1987, and the establishment of an alternative slaughterhouse.

In the first court order, the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board had ordered the closure of a slaughterhouse run by the Municipal Corporation in Raipur due to violations of pollution control laws. The petitioner, who was the president of a traders' association, argued that the closure violated their constitutional right to livelihood. The court considered the arguments of all parties and ultimately ruled that the closure was justified due to the violations of pollution control laws and that an alternative slaughterhouse was being established. The court also emphasized the importance of the right to livelihood as a part of the right to life.

The second court order discussed various rules and sections related to the slaughter of animals, disposal of polluting matter, and restrictions on industrial plants. Rule 3 of the 2001 Rules states that animals cannot be slaughtered except in recognized or licensed houses, and certain animals cannot be slaughtered at all. Sections 24 and 25 of the Water Act prohibit the discharge of polluting matter into streams or wells without the consent of the State Board. Sections 21 and 22 of the Air Act require the previous consent of the State Board to establish or operate any industrial plant in an air pollution control area.

The third court order pertained to the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1987. It stated that any person who commenced operations under Section 9 of the Act without prior consent may continue to do so for three months from the commencement of the section or until the disposal of their application for consent. The State Board may make inquiries and grant or refuse consent within four months of receiving an application. Those granted consent must comply with specified conditions, including installing and maintaining control equipment and chimneys. The order also discussed the constitution of a State level committee for monitoring slaughterhouses, which is responsible for identifying and inspecting slaughterhouses, recommending modernization and relocation, and preventing cruelty to animals.

The fourth court order stated that if slaughterhouses are located in densely populated areas, they cannot be renewed and new slaughterhouses should be established elsewhere. The slaughterhouse in question was running without permission and has been directed to be closed. The Municipal Corporation has a statutory obligation to establish an alternative slaughterhouse, and failure to do so violates the citizens' right to life. The court cites previous cases where the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and access to basic necessities such as roads. The Municipal Corporation cannot use lack of funds as an excuse for not fulfilling their statutory obligations. The court directs the Corporation to establish an alternative slaughterhouse.

The fifth court order mandates the state government to provide sufficient financial aid to the Ratlam Municipality to fulfill its obligations under the order. The court also directs the municipality to slim its budget on low priority items and elitist projects to use the savings on sanitation and public health. The order also discusses various cases related to the ban on slaughter of animals and the violation of fundamental rights to carry on trade and business. The court directs the Collector, Raipur to allot land to the Municipal Corporation for the establishment of a slaughterhouse within three weeks and complete the project within six months. The court also directs various authorities to oversee the issue of establishment of the slaughterhouse and ensure that persons eligible are allowed to carry on their trade and business guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.

In conclusion, these court orders emphasize the importance of adhering to pollution control laws and regulations related to the slaughter of animals and disposal of polluting matter. They also highlight the significance of the right to livelihood as a part of the right to life and the obligation of the Municipal Corporation to establish an alternative slaughterhouse. The court orders also direct various authorities to oversee the establishment of the slaughterhouse and ensure that persons eligible are allowed to carry on their trade and business guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
