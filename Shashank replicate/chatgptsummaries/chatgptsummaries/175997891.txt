The Supreme Court of India recently heard an appeal by the State of Manipur and others against Chandam Manihar Singh. The case involved the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the reconstitution of the State Pollution Control Board. The respondent was appointed as Chairman of the Board, but allegations were made against him, and he was removed from office by the Governor of Manipur. The respondent challenged his removal in a writ petition before the High Court of Assam, Imphal Bench, and the court allowed his petition. The State appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court found that the respondent's tenure as Chairman was almost over, and the first grievance raised by the State had become of academic interest. The court then considered the second point, which concerned the interpretation of relevant provisions of the Act in case of any casual vacancy of any member of the Board duly constituted under Section 4.

The court order states that when a member of the Board is replaced due to a casual vacancy, the successor will only serve for the remaining period of the original member's term. The State authorities should not reconstitute the entire Board every time a new member is inducted or a new Chairman is appointed. The tenure of the reconstituted Board will also be governed by Section 4(1). The court found that the High Court was in error in taking the view that the tenure of the respondent as Chairman could have gone beyond 4-5-1998. However, this will have no effect on the final orders passed by the High Court as the respondent has less than a month left as Chairman. After 15-10-1999, the appellant authorities can fill up the vacancy of the Chairman in accordance with the law.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for proper adherence to the law and regulations governing the appointment and removal of officials. The respondent's removal from office by the Governor of Manipur was challenged in a writ petition before the High Court of Assam, Imphal Bench, and the court allowed his petition. The State appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court found that the respondent's tenure as Chairman was almost over, and the first grievance raised by the State had become of academic interest.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the interpretation of relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the reconstitution of the State Pollution Control Board. It emphasizes the need for proper adherence to the law and regulations governing the appointment and removal of officials, and clarifies the tenure of members of the Board in case of any casual vacancy.
