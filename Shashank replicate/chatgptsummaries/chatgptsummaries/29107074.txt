The court order pertains to a dispute between Essar Oil Limited, a petitioner company, and the State of Gujarat regarding the payment of sales tax and interest. The petitioner company had opted for sales tax incentives on a deferment basis under a scheme framed by the State Government. However, the petitioner company was required to commence commercial production by 15.8.2003, but it could not proceed due to a Public Interest Litigation. The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the writ petition by its judgment and order dated 22.4.2008. The Division Bench observed that the petitioner company shall not be given the benefit of deferment of sales tax/value-added tax beyond 14.8.2020.

The State Government started recovering the amount of sales tax for the relevant period as the appeal of the State was already allowed by the Supreme Court. The petitioner company wrote letters from time to time to the department, and subsequently, the Supreme Court rejected the Review Petition. The petitioners submitted an application to the Additional Chief Secretary (Finance), Ministry of Finance, Gandhinagar, praying that the State may give remission of the whole amount and the interest payable and allow the petitioner No.1 company to pay the tax amount without interest during the period of payment by eight equal year installments commencing from 1.4.2013. The State Government was proceeding to recover the amount, and the petitioners subsequently approached the High Court by way of the present writ petition. The High Court passed an interim order in favor of the petitioners.

The court order states that a dealer who does not pay the amount of tax on or before the prescribed date shall pay simple interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum on the amount of tax not paid. The court also states that the provisions of sections 41 and 42 of the Act can be made applicable in case of public interest or in case where it is a case of double taxation or any other equitable ground. The court dismisses the petition and vacates the ad-interim relief granted earlier, allowing the State Government to proceed further expeditiously to recover the amount in question.

The court order also notes that the petitioner company had collected the tax amount from its customers but had not remitted it to the government. The state government had demanded payment, but the petitioner company had asked for a deferment until the Review Petition was decided. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the Review Petition, and the state government proceeded to recover the amount owed. The petitioner company then filed an application under sections 41 and 42 of the Act for remission of interest and installments. However, the court rejected the petitioner company's request to restrain the state government from recovering the amount owed until the application was decided. The court also noted that the petitioner company had not paid any amount towards the sales tax it had already collected and retained for a long time.

The court order further states that the State had filed a Misc. Civil Application to recover an amount from the petitioner company, but the court had granted an ad-interim stay on the recovery. Now that the petition has been rejected, the court can ask the State to proceed with the recovery. The petitioner company had collected the amount from its customers towards tax but had invested it in its own company instead of paying it back to the State. The court considers this an unauthorized retention of public money. The Misc. Civil Application is now disposed of.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a dispute between Essar Oil Limited and the State of Gujarat regarding the payment of sales tax and interest. The court rejected the petitioner company's request to restrain the state government from recovering the amount owed until the application was decided. The court also noted that the petitioner company had not paid any amount towards the sales tax it had already collected and retained for a long time. The court considers this an unauthorized retention of public money and allows the State Government to proceed further expeditiously to recover the amount in question.
