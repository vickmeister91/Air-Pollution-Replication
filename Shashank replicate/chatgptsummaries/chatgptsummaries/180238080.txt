Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a different case. The first order is from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Kolkata and deals with an appeal by Goldline Writing Instruments Ltd. against an order by the CIT(A)-VI. The issue at hand is the disallowance of a claim under section 80IB(10) of the Income Tax Act for the development of a house building project. The Assessing Officer had doubts about the completion certificate issued by the Municipality and found that the project could not have been completed before the date of application for completion certificate. The appellant argued that the Assessing Officer cannot re-agitate the issue as the competent authority is only the Municipality and the building has to be constructed as per the terms and conditions of the municipal rules. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the appellant.

The second court order pertains to a dispute between flat owners and an assessee over extra space available for car parking. The assessee attempted to construct a structure on the reserve space earmarked for car parking, which led to a writ petition by the flat owners. The dispute between the parties is pending before the High Court. The court order deals with the eligibility of the assessee for a deduction under Section 80IB(10) of the Income Tax Act. The court held that the assessee qualifies for the deduction as it fulfilled all the conditions laid down in Section 80IB(10). The order allows the appeal of the assessee and grants the deduction claimed under Section 80IB.

The third court order lists the parties involved in a case, including the appellant (M/s. Goldline Writing Instruments Ltd.), the respondent (ITO, Ward-6(2), Kolkata), the CIT(A) Kolkata, CIT Kolkata, and DR Kolkata Benches. The order also includes a request for a true copy and is signed by an assistant registrar.
