The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Suraj Bhan Kataria against the State of Delhi and Anjana Dahiya. The case involves a complaint filed by Dahiya under the Negotiable Instrument Act, alleging that Kataria issued a bounced cheque. Kataria denied issuing the cheque and claimed that Dahiya may have stolen it. Kataria's counsel requested the court to send the cheque to a handwriting expert or CFSL for comparison of signatures and to summon several witnesses in his defense. The court heard both parties and perused the record before passing the order.

The court order dismisses Kataria's revision application in the case involving cheques. The court finds that there is no need for comparison of signatures or determination of the age of ink on the cheques. The court also finds that the examination of witnesses and placing of documents on record will not assist the petitioner in establishing their defense. The trial court record is sent back to the trial court, and the revision file is consigned to the record room.
