In a recent court order, the court had to determine whether the payment of costs was a condition precedent to the institution of a suit. The case in question involved a pauper application that was dismissed and costs were ordered to be paid by the opponent and the government. The plaintiff then filed a suit on payment of court fees without paying the costs, and the defendant did not object to the suit at that time. However, later an objection was raised that the costs had not been paid, and they were paid after all the evidence had been recorded.

The court had to decide whether the payment of costs was a condition precedent to the institution of the suit. The court held that the payment of costs was not a condition precedent, but they must be paid, and if not paid, the court may reject the plaint or stay the suit pending their payment. The court also discussed the Madras High Court's approach to the issue and disagreed with it.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the position on the payment of costs in relation to the institution of a suit. The court held that while the payment of costs is not a condition precedent, it is still necessary for the costs to be paid. This means that if a plaintiff fails to pay the costs, the court may reject the plaint or stay the suit pending their payment.

The court's decision is also important because it disagrees with the Madras High Court's approach to the issue. The Madras High Court had held that the payment of costs was a condition precedent to the institution of a suit. However, the court in this case disagreed with this approach and held that the payment of costs was not a condition precedent.

Overall, the court's decision provides clarity on the issue of the payment of costs in relation to the institution of a suit. It makes it clear that while the payment of costs is not a condition precedent, it is still necessary for the costs to be paid. This decision will be of great help to litigants who may be unsure about the position on the payment of costs in relation to the institution of a suit.
