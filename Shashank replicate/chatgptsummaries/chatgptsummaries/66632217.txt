The High Court of Kerala recently issued two court orders regarding disputes related to electricity supply. In the first case, the State of Kerala and the Forest Department challenged an interim order that allowed a petitioner to draw electricity supply through a Reserve Forest area without prior approval from the Central Government. The court did not consider the merits of the dispute but questioned whether the interim relief granted by the single Judge was final relief. The court examined the writ petition's prayers and the interim relief sought and concluded that the interim relief was not final relief.

The second court order pertains to a petitioner seeking electricity connections under the R.G.G.V.Y. Scheme. The learned single judge had granted an interim order directing the respondents to draw electricity supply line to the petitioner's house. However, the court found that the interim relief granted was virtually the same as the main relief sought and could not be sustained in the eye of the law. The order was set aside, and the petitioner was allowed to move the learned single judge for an early hearing of the writ petition.

In the first case, the dispute arose when a petitioner requested electricity supply to his residence, and the State and Forest Department challenged an interim order to draw the electricity supply line through a Reserve Forest area without prior approval from the Central Government. The court did not consider the merits of the dispute but questioned whether the interim relief granted by the single Judge was final relief. The court examined the writ petition's prayers and the interim relief sought and concluded that the interim relief was not final relief.

The court observed that the interim relief granted by the single Judge was virtually the same as the main relief sought by the petitioner. The court noted that the petitioner had sought a direction to the respondents to provide electricity supply to his residence, and the interim relief granted by the single Judge was also a direction to provide electricity supply to the petitioner's residence. The court held that the interim relief granted by the single Judge was not final relief and could not be sustained in the eye of the law.

The court also observed that the Reserve Forest area was a protected area, and any activity in the area required prior approval from the Central Government. The court noted that the respondents had not obtained prior approval from the Central Government before drawing the electricity supply line through the Reserve Forest area. The court held that the respondents could not be allowed to draw the electricity supply line through the Reserve Forest area without prior approval from the Central Government.

In the second case, the petitioner had sought electricity connections under the R.G.G.V.Y. Scheme. The learned single judge had granted an interim order directing the respondents to draw electricity supply line to the petitioner's house. However, the court found that the interim relief granted was virtually the same as the main relief sought and could not be sustained in the eye of the law.

The court observed that the petitioner had sought electricity connections under the R.G.G.V.Y. Scheme, and the respondents had already approved the petitioner's application. The court noted that the respondents had also issued a work order for the installation of the electricity supply line to the petitioner's house. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to the electricity connections under the R.G.G.V.Y. Scheme, and the respondents were bound to provide the same.

The court set aside the interim order granted by the learned single judge and allowed the petitioner to move the learned single judge for an early hearing of the writ petition. The court directed the respondents to provide the electricity connections to the petitioner's house within a reasonable time.

In conclusion, the High Court of Kerala issued two court orders regarding disputes related to electricity supply. In the first case, the court questioned whether the interim relief granted by the single Judge was final relief and held that the respondents could not draw the electricity supply line through the Reserve Forest area without prior approval from the Central Government. In the second case, the court set aside the interim order granted by the learned single judge and directed the respondents to provide the electricity connections to the petitioner's house within a reasonable time.
