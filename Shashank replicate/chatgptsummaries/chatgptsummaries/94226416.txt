The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard several appeals related to pollution control in West Bengal, including cases involving Biswanath Mondal, the International Marwari Association, and Pradesh Atasbazi Byabsaee Samity. The respondents in these cases included the State of West Bengal, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), and the Commissioner of Police in Kolkata. The court order lists the members of the tribunal who presided over the cases.

Another court order discusses a bunch of applications filed by various parties challenging the noise level standards for manufacturing and selling firecrackers in the state of West Bengal. The applicants sought more liberal noise level standards and challenged the orders of the WBPCB and the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The case has a history dating back to 1985 and involves various parties, including the State of West Bengal and the Police Commissioner's Office. The court ultimately upheld the noise level standards set by the WBPCB and dismissed the applications.

The court order discusses the maximum permissible noise level of fireworks in the state of West Bengal, which was fixed at 90 dB(A) impulse noise at 5 meters from the source. The order was challenged by traders and a society of traders, but the challenge failed. The Supreme Court later allowed the use of firecrackers generating noise levels up to 125dB(A-I) or 145dB(C)pk at 4 meters distance from the point of bursting, but the issue was re-examined by the High Court. The WBPCB passed an order banning the manufacturing of firecrackers that produced sound levels of more than 90dB(A-I) at 5 meters from the point of bursting. The order was challenged by the Applicants, who alleged that the order was arbitrary and lacked a logical basis. The WBPCB and other respondents denied the allegations and supported the order. The court also discussed the powers of the WBPCB and the MoEF under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Another court order discusses a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers generating noise levels exceeding 90 dB(A) impulse at a distance of 5 meters from the source in the state of West Bengal. The ban was issued by the WBPCB in compliance with a judgment of the Calcutta High Court. The order is being challenged by the appellants who argue that the limit of 90dB(A-I) for firecrackers is impermissible and that the WBPCB did not follow Rule 3(2) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The respondents argue that the impugned order is issued by the WBPCB in view of enabling powers available under Rule 3(2) of the Environment (Protection), Rules, 1986. The court is examining the legality and validity of the impugned order and the MoEF Notification.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by firecrackers during the Diwali festival in India. The court notes that bursting firecrackers can lead to non-recoverable hearing loss and contribute to air pollution. The Central Pollution Control Board has been monitoring the ambient noise level during Diwali since 1993 and found that the noise level exceeded the limit at almost all places during these years. The court also notes that the sound level for firecrackers is fixed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and approved by the Supreme Court. The court concludes that immediate steps need to be taken to address the issue of noise pollution caused by firecrackers.

Another court order discusses the hasty decision made by the WBPCB in 1997 to accept the recommendations of an expert committee without proper evaluation or consideration of other materials. The court also notes that the WBPCB did not comply with the High Court's order to consider the views of another expert. The court further states that the WBPCB's power to lower the benchmark for decibels in firecrackers must be based on sufficient reasons and scientific study of the impact on the environment. The court also highlights the importance of the MoEF Notification issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which should be given precedence over subordinate legislation. The court concludes that the WBPCB's notification is unsustainable in the eye of the law and does not specify the particular provision of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the Environment (Protection) Act under which it was issued. The court also discusses the functions of the State Board and the need to lay down standards for emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere from industrial plants and automobiles.

The court order states that the State Board cannot make unilateral decisions on emission standards for air pollutants from industrial plants and automobiles without consulting the Central Board. The impugned Notification issued by the WBPCB is held as illegal and inoperative. The WBPCB is required to amend the order and reconcile it with the MoEF Notification dated 05.10.1999. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) is directed to conduct a fresh study on "Noise Pollution and its Impacts" and suggest specific norms for manufacturing, sale, and distribution of firecrackers inter-state and intra-state. The WBPCB is at liberty to take independent decisions in consultation with the CPCB if the reduction of noise level is found necessary for
