In a recent court order, the case of Shankar Singh and others was addressed. The group had been arrested for allegedly killing a male barking deer in a forest area and possessing a muzzle loading gun. The applicants filed for bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and the court allowed their release on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount. 

The court took into consideration the fact that the applicants had been in judicial custody since August 5, 2018, and the charge sheet had already been filed. The court also noted that the trial would take considerable time in disposal of the case. 

The decision to grant bail to the applicants was not taken lightly. The court considered several factors before making its decision. One of the most important factors was the length of time that the applicants had already spent in custody. The court recognized that being in custody for an extended period of time can be detrimental to an individual's mental and physical health. 

Additionally, the court noted that the charge sheet had already been filed, which meant that the prosecution had completed its investigation and had presented its case against the applicants. This factor was important because it indicated that the applicants were not a flight risk and were not likely to interfere with the investigation. 

The court also recognized that the trial would take considerable time in disposal of the case. This factor was important because it indicated that the applicants would be in custody for an extended period of time if bail was not granted. 

In light of these factors, the court decided to grant bail to the applicants. However, the court did not grant bail unconditionally. The applicants were required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount. This requirement was put in place to ensure that the applicants would appear in court when required and would not flee from justice. 

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the case of Shankar Singh and others is an important decision that takes into consideration several factors. The decision to grant bail to the applicants was not taken lightly and was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case. The court recognized the importance of balancing the interests of justice with the rights of the accused and made a decision that was fair and just.
