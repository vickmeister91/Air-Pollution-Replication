The court order in question pertains to an appeal challenging a judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir. The appellant-petitioner was given promotion as Master on the assumption that he was appointed as a Teacher on 13.12.1988. However, the respondent- Department later found that he was appointed as a Teacher on 10.09.1992 and was thus not eligible for promotion to the post of Master. The appellant-petitioner approached the Writ Court with the prayer that the order cancelling the order of promotion was passed without following the principles of natural justice. The learned Single Judge rejected his prayer by holding that the rules of natural justice are not a mere ritual but their non-compliance must adversely affect the rights of a person. The court found that the appeal would not merit admission and is thus liable to be dismissed.
