In a recent court order, a petitioner was accused of violating forest and conservation laws. The petitioner claimed that he had transferred the dumper in question to another person and was not liable for its seizure or for carrying illegally mined iron ore. However, the state argued that the dumper belonged to the petitioner as per the owner book found in it and that illegal mining and transportation of iron ore was rampant in the area. The court rejected the petitioner's plea for anticipatory bail considering all these aspects.
