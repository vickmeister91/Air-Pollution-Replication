In a recent court order, a criminal petition filed by Smt. M.S. Parvathamma against Sri Narasimha Murthy T.R. was dismissed by the court. The petition sought to quash an order passed by the 23rd ACMM Bengaluru on an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The section also allows the court to direct any person in possession of such document or thing to produce it before the court.

In this case, it appears that the 23rd ACMM Bengaluru had passed an order under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. directing Sri Narasimha Murthy T.R. to produce certain documents or things before the court. Smt. M.S. Parvathamma had filed a petition seeking to quash this order.

However, during the course of the proceedings, the petitioner's counsel filed a memo seeking to withdraw the petition. As a result, the court dismissed the petition as withdrawn.

It is not clear from the available information why the petitioner sought to withdraw the petition. It is possible that the petitioner may have obtained the documents or things that were the subject of the Section 91 order, or that the petitioner may have decided not to pursue the matter further.

In any case, the court's order dismissing the petition as withdrawn means that the petition will not be heard further by the court. It is also worth noting that the dismissal of the petition does not necessarily mean that the underlying Section 91 order has been quashed or set aside. The order may still be in force, and Sri Narasimha Murthy T.R. may still be required to produce the documents or things before the court as directed.
