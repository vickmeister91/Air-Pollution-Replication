Three court orders have been issued in relation to eviction petitions filed by landlords against tenants for non-payment of rent. The first order pertains to a dispute over whether interest on rent not paid timely becomes part of rent or not, and whether non-payment of such interest despite notice renders the tenant liable to be evicted. The court held that interest accrued on late payment becomes arrears of rent legally recoverable and if not paid within two months of the date of which notice of payment for arrears of rent has been served on the tenant, the tenant can be evicted.

The second court order states that if a tenant fails to pay rent on time, including the interest of 15% per annum as per the law, they are in default and can be evicted under Section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act. The tenants cannot claim that the landlords did not accept the rent offered to them, as they should have deposited the rent under Section 27 of the DRC Act. The court orders the tenants to pay the interest on the arrears of rent within one month to extend the benefit of Section 14(2) of the DRC Act. The proviso of Section 14(2) does not apply in this case as the tenants did not obtain the benefit earlier. The eviction petition is proved in favor of the landlords.

The third court order requires the tenant respondents to pay interest at a rate of 15% per annum for the default period mentioned in the eviction petition. The interest must be paid to the landlords/petitioners within one month from the date of the order. The main eviction petition has been disposed of, and a miscellaneous file will be prepared to monitor compliance with the order and determine if the tenant is eligible for benefits under section 14(2) of the DRC Act. The respondent must appear and provide information on compliance with the order on December 20, 2010.

In summary, all three court orders relate to eviction petitions filed by landlords against tenants for non-payment of rent. The first order clarifies that interest accrued on late payment becomes arrears of rent legally recoverable and can lead to eviction if not paid within two months of notice. The second order states that tenants who fail to pay rent on time, including interest, can be evicted under Section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act and must pay interest on arrears of rent within one month to extend the benefit of Section 14(2). The third order requires the tenant respondents to pay interest at a rate of 15% per annum for the default period mentioned in the eviction petition and appear to provide information on compliance with the order.
