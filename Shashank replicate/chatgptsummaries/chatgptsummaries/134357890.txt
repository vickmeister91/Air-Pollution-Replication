The Asbestos Cement Products Manufacturers' Association was allowed to be added as a party respondent in a case where the petitioners sought a ban on the use of asbestos due to its carcinogenic properties. The court noted that the issue had already been settled by the Supreme Court in previous cases, but the directions issued by the Supreme Court regarding the regulation of asbestos use would continue to be binding on the respondents. The court disposed of the petition in light of this.

Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that has been used for centuries in various applications, including construction, insulation, and fireproofing. However, it has been linked to various health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis. As a result, many countries have banned or restricted its use.

In India, the use of asbestos has been a contentious issue for many years. In 2011, the Indian government banned the mining and use of asbestos, but this ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013. The court ruled that the ban was not based on scientific evidence and that the government had not provided an alternative to asbestos for the construction industry.

Since then, there have been several petitions filed in various courts seeking a ban on the use of asbestos. One such petition was filed in the Delhi High Court by a group of petitioners who argued that asbestos was a carcinogenic substance and that its use should be banned in India.

The court allowed an application by The Asbestos Cement Products Manufacturers' Association to be added as a party respondent in the case. The association argued that asbestos was not a carcinogenic substance and that its use was safe if proper precautions were taken.

The court noted that the issue of the use of asbestos had already been settled by the Supreme Court in previous cases. However, the court also noted that the directions issued by the Supreme Court regarding the regulation of asbestos use would continue to be binding on the respondents.

The Supreme Court had directed the government to take various measures to regulate the use of asbestos, including setting up a national registry of workers exposed to asbestos, providing medical facilities to such workers, and ensuring that asbestos was handled and disposed of safely.

The court disposed of the petition in light of these directions, noting that the respondents were bound to comply with them. The court did not issue any further orders regarding the use of asbestos.

The decision of the court is likely to be welcomed by the asbestos industry, which has been lobbying for the continued use of asbestos in India. However, it is also likely to be criticized by health and environmental activists, who argue that asbestos is a dangerous substance that should be banned outright.

The use of asbestos remains a contentious issue in many countries, with some arguing that it is a necessary material for certain applications, while others argue that it is too dangerous to be used at all. The decision of the Delhi High Court is unlikely to settle this debate, but it does provide some clarity regarding the regulation of asbestos use in India.
