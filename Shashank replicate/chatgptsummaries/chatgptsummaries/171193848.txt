The Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the third respondent to grant transport permits to the petitioner. IREL had been issued mining leases by the Government of Tamil Nadu between 1968 and 1998, and they were continuously mining from lease items 1 and 3 and occasionally from lease item 2. The petitioner had applied for EIA and CRZ clearances for all the leases, and the applications were processed by the authorities. The Environment Assessment Committee had already given its recommendations to issue EIA clearances to all four leases of the petitioner subject to the grant of CRZ clearance. The petitioner was awaiting the EIA and CRZ clearances pending amendment of CRZ 1991. The third respondent stopped issuing transport permits from February 2017, and the permit was denied on the charge that the petitioner failed to produce the necessary environment clearance called for vide their letter dated 29.01.2017. The petitioner sought relief on various grounds, including that the leases were executed even before the commencement of the EPA, 1986, and that the petitioner was mining continuously over a long period of time without any guilt of illegal mining. The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioners reiterated each of the grounds raised in the affidavit.

The court order pertains to a case involving illegal beach sand mining in Kanyakumari Districts. The third respondent submitted a counter affidavit stating that the renewal of lease has not been granted by the government due to non-fulfillment of environmental clearance/CRZ clearance. The court examined various orders and directives related to environmental clearances and concluded that the petitioner had applied for EIA and CRZ clearances in 2012 and had genuinely participated in the compliance process. The court also noted that the letter from the third respondent calling for filing of environmental clearances by the petitioner appeared to be a sham. The court held that the balance of convenience was in favor of the petitioner and that legitimate rights could not be denied. The court also noted the treatment of atomic minerals in the environment protection policy of the Government of India.

The court order recognizes the treatment of atomic minerals in the environment protection policy of the Government of India and acknowledges that rare minerals mined by the petitioner cater to the strategic interest of the State. The court allows transportation of already collected sand and finished products from the factory and directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests to dispose of the petitioner's applications within two months. The court finds the case unique and allows the writ petition without costs.
