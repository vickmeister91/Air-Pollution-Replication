The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Ashok Itagi, who sought to quash an order rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking production of certain documents in a case pending before the trial court for offences punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had contended that the documents were required to ascertain whether his plea that the cheque was forged or not is right. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the plea was too far-fetched and that there were other methods to ascertain the authenticity of the signature on the cheque.

The case in question involves a dispute over a cheque that was allegedly dishonoured by the accused. The petitioner, Ashok Itagi, had claimed that the cheque was forged and that he was not responsible for its dishonour. In order to prove his innocence, he had sought the production of certain documents that he believed would help him establish the authenticity of the cheque.

However, the court rejected his plea, stating that it was too far-fetched and that there were other methods to ascertain the authenticity of the signature on the cheque. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the cheque was forged.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows a court to order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court can only order the production of such documents or things if it is satisfied that they are necessary or desirable for the purposes of the case.

In this case, the court was not satisfied that the documents sought by the petitioner were necessary or desirable for the purposes of the case. The court noted that there were other methods to ascertain the authenticity of the signature on the cheque, such as expert opinion or handwriting analysis. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the cheque was forged.

The court's decision highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in a criminal case. In this case, the petitioner's claim that the cheque was forged was not supported by any evidence, and the court was therefore unable to order the production of the documents sought by the petitioner.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the burden of proof lies with the party making the claim, and that evidence must be provided to support any claims made in a criminal case. While Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for the production of documents and things that are necessary or desirable for the purposes of a case, the court will only order such production if it is satisfied that they are necessary or desirable for the purposes of the case.
