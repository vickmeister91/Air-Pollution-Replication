The court order pertains to a criminal writ petition filed by Dattatraya Chandrakant Kakade against the District Magistrate and others. The petitioner is challenging a preventive detention order passed against him under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers & Drug-Offenders, Dangerous Persons, Video Pirates, Sand Smugglers and Persons Engaged in Black-Marketing of Essential Commodities Act, 1981. The petitioner has raised several grounds for challenging the detention order, but the court focuses on one specific ground related to the violation of the detenu's right to make an effective representation due to the failure to provide basic facts and material in relation to the first information reports mentioned in the grounds of detention. The court hears arguments from both sides and issues an oral judgment.

The court found that the grounds of detention provided to the detenu did not include all the basic facts and materials that influenced the detaining authority in making the order of detention. The court referred to Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution, which requires that all basic facts and materials that influenced the detaining authority in making the order of detention must be communicated to the detenu. The court emphasized that these legal safeguards are necessary to prevent arbitrary or improper exercise of the vast powers of preventive detention.

The court order discusses the importance of grounds of detention in preventing arbitrary or improper exercise of preventive detention powers. It states that a 'ground' means all the basic facts and material taken into account by the detaining authority while issuing the order of detention. The court finds that the detaining authority cannot deny that paragraph 3(1) is a ground of detention and that there is a clear violation of the safeguard provided under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India of communicating grounds of detention to the detenu. As a result, the impugned order of detention is quashed and set aside.

In summary, the court order deals with a criminal writ petition filed by Dattatraya Chandrakant Kakade challenging a preventive detention order passed against him. The court focuses on the violation of the detenu's right to make an effective representation due to the failure to provide basic facts and material in relation to the first information reports mentioned in the grounds of detention. The court emphasizes the importance of legal safeguards to prevent arbitrary or improper exercise of preventive detention powers and refers to Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution. The court finds that there is a clear violation of the safeguard provided under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India of communicating grounds of detention to the detenu and quashes the impugned order of detention.
