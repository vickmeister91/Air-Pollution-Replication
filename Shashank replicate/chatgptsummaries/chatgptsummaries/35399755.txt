The court order in question pertains to a preliminary issue of whether the civil court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit filed by Mohd. Shahid against BSES RPL under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act. The defendant argued that the civil court's jurisdiction is expressly barred under the Acts and that such disputes can only be entertained by the authority established under the Act. However, the court held that the jurisdiction is barred only with respect to matters that the Appellate Authority is empowered to deal with. Since the plaintiff does not challenge the order passed by the board and is seeking an injunction to prevent the disconnection of his electricity and water connection, the court held that the suit is maintainable.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Mohd. Shahid and BSES RPL over the disconnection of Shahid's electricity and water connection. Shahid filed a suit in the civil court seeking an injunction to prevent the disconnection, citing violations of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act. BSES RPL argued that the civil court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, as disputes under these Acts can only be heard by the authority established under the Acts.

The court examined the provisions of the Acts and noted that they do indeed provide for the establishment of an authority to deal with disputes arising under the Acts. However, the court also noted that the jurisdiction of the civil court is not completely barred under the Acts. The Acts only bar the jurisdiction of the civil court with respect to matters that the Appellate Authority is empowered to deal with. In other words, if the Appellate Authority has the power to deal with a particular matter, the civil court cannot hear a case on that matter.

In this case, the plaintiff is not challenging the order passed by the board, which is within the purview of the Appellate Authority. Rather, the plaintiff is seeking an injunction to prevent the disconnection of his electricity and water connection. The court held that this matter is not within the purview of the Appellate Authority and therefore the civil court has jurisdiction to hear the case.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters arising under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act. It establishes that the civil court's jurisdiction is not completely barred under these Acts and that it can hear cases that are not within the purview of the Appellate Authority. This decision will have implications for future cases involving disputes under these Acts and will provide clarity to litigants and lawyers on the jurisdiction of the civil court in such matters.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters arising under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act. The court held that the civil court's jurisdiction is not completely barred under these Acts and that it can hear cases that are not within the purview of the Appellate Authority. This decision provides clarity on the jurisdiction of the civil court in such matters and will have implications for future cases involving disputes under these Acts.
