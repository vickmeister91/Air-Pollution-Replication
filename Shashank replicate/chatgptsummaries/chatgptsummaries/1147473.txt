The Indian courts have recently issued two orders related to the protection of ecology and prevention of irreversible ecological damage in coastal areas. The first order pertains to several original petitions filed regarding the Goshree Project in Kerala and other projects from an environmental point of view. The court directed the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to examine the Goshree Project and provide recommendations to the concerned states. The court also directed the government to constitute a National Coastal Management Authority and an independent National Environmental Impact Assessment Authority.

The Goshree Project involved the reclamation of land in Cochin backwaters and was given environmental clearance subject to compliance with certain conditions. The court dismissed several petitions challenging the project, stating that the proposed reclamation would not take place within the coastal regulation zone. The court's decision was based on the fact that the project was not located within the coastal regulation zone and that the proposed reclamation would not cause irreversible ecological damage.

The second court order discusses a proposed construction project involving the reclamation of land near a marine drive. The court had previously dismissed an appeal related to the project due to uncertainty about the demarcation of the high tide line and its impact on the coastal regulation zone. However, the court now finds it difficult to hold that the proposed reclamation will fall within the coastal regulation zone and allows the project to proceed with a caveat that all attempts to implement the project without reclamation should be exhausted first.

The government is also reminded of its duty to provide basic infrastructure and amenities to islanders and to consider alternative proposals for the project. The court orders a report from the government and the project authority within six weeks.

The court's decision in the first order is significant as it directs the government to constitute a National Coastal Management Authority and an independent National Environmental Impact Assessment Authority. These authorities will be responsible for ensuring that all projects in coastal areas are environmentally sustainable and do not cause irreversible ecological damage. The decision also highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining environmental clearance before undertaking any project in coastal areas.

The court's decision in the second order is also significant as it allows the project to proceed with a caveat that all attempts to implement the project without reclamation should be exhausted first. This decision emphasizes the importance of exploring alternative proposals and exhausting all options before resorting to reclamation. The court's reminder to the government to provide basic infrastructure and amenities to islanders is also significant as it highlights the need to consider the impact of projects on local communities and their livelihoods.

In conclusion, the recent court orders related to the protection of ecology and prevention of irreversible ecological damage in coastal areas of India highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining environmental clearance before undertaking any project in coastal areas. The orders also emphasize the need to explore alternative proposals and exhaust all options before resorting to reclamation. The constitution of a National Coastal Management Authority and an independent National Environmental Impact Assessment Authority will ensure that all projects in coastal areas are environmentally sustainable and do not cause irreversible ecological damage.
