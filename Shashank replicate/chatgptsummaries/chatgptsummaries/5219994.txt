The court has recently granted bail to two women, Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili, who were arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The two women are to be released on bail upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. Additionally, they are required to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that was enacted to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violation of this act can result in imprisonment and/or fines.

In this case, Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili were arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. It is unclear what specific actions they took that led to their arrest, but it is likely that they were involved in some form of wildlife-related crime.

Despite their arrest, the court has granted them bail. Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody while they await trial. In this case, Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili were granted bail upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. This means that they have to pay a certain amount of money as a guarantee that they will appear in court for every hearing until the completion of the trial.

The granting of bail is not uncommon in India, and it is often granted to individuals who are not considered a flight risk or a danger to society. In this case, it is likely that the court did not consider Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili to be a flight risk or a danger to society, which is why they were granted bail.

However, it is important to note that being granted bail does not mean that the charges against Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili have been dropped. They are still required to appear in court for every hearing until the completion of the trial. If they fail to appear in court, they could be arrested again and their bail could be revoked.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Smt. Mirgi and Smt. Kaili, who were arrested for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. They are to be released on bail upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. They are required to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. It is important to note that being granted bail does not mean that the charges against them have been dropped, and they are still required to appear in court for every hearing until the completion of the trial.
