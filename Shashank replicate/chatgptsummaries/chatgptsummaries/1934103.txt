The Supreme Court of India received a public interest petition from the Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum against the pollution caused by untreated effluent from tanneries and other industries in Tamil Nadu. The petition stated that the effluent was being discharged into agricultural fields, waterways, and open lands, ultimately polluting the main source of water supply to the area. The tanneries were accused of causing environmental degradation and using about 170 types of chemicals in the chrome tanning process, resulting in dangerously enormous quantities of toxic effluents being let out in the open. The court ordered the tanneries to control the pollution caused by the discharge of effluent.

The court order divides 553 industries into three parts, with the first two parts given three months to complete the setting up of Effluent Treatment Plants or face closure and pollution fines. The third part, consisting of 57 tanneries, is ordered to be closed immediately for failing to install and commission the plants despite previous orders. The order also directs the District Collector and Senior Superintendent of Police to ensure compliance and gives the industries an opportunity to approach the court when steps towards setting up the plants have been taken. The order also mentions the suspension of closure orders for some industries and the involvement of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute in examining the feasibility of setting up CETPs for tanneries in Tamil Nadu.

The court order states that out of 30 CETPs inspected, only 7 are operational, while 10 are under construction and 13 are proposed. The 7 operational CETPs are not meeting the standards set by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The court directs the units to comply with the recommendations of NEERI within two months. Tanneries not connected to the operational CETPs are polluting the area and are ordered to be closed immediately. The court also directs the state of Tamil Nadu not to permit the setting up of further tanneries in the state. The NEERI team is directed to inspect industries and file a report. The court also addresses the issue of distilleries in the state.

The court has ordered the Pollution Control Board to issue notices to distilleries to set up pollution control devices or face closure. Reports from NEERI indicate that groundwater in certain areas does not conform to drinking water standards due to pollution from industries. The court has been monitoring the pollution caused by tanneries in Tamil Nadu for five years and despite repeated extensions, the tanneries have failed to control their pollution. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the principles of inter-generational equity, use and conservation of natural resources, environmental protection, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle. These principles are part of the environmental law of the country and are incorporated into domestic law.

The court order discusses the incorporation of customary international law into domestic law, specifically in relation to the right to a clean environment. The order cites Blackstone's commentaries on the Laws of England to support the idea that a person's right to a pollution-free environment is a part of basic jurisprudence. The Environment Act is also discussed, with relevant sections outlining the power of the Central Government to take measures to protect and improve the environment, including laying down standards for emissions and discharge of pollutants, restricting certain industries or processes, and establishing environmental laboratories and institutes.

The court order requires the Central Government to establish measures for the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution, including the establishment of environmental laboratories and institutes. The government may appoint officers with powers and functions under the Environment Act and issue directions to any person, officer, or authority to comply with the Act's provisions. The Act also sets standards for emission or discharge of environmental pollutants and prohibits the location of industries and carrying on of processes and operations in different areas. The court directs the Central Government to take immediate action under the provisions of the Environment Act to protect the environment from pollution caused by tanneries operating in Tamil Nadu. The polluters must compensate affected persons and pay the cost of restoring the damaged ecology.

The court order refers to a government notification that bans highly polluting industries within one kilometer of certain water sources. The court directs that these standards be maintained by tanneries and other industries in Tamil Nadu. The court also orders the central government to constitute an authority to deal with the situation created by polluting industries and implement the "precautionary principle" and "polluter pays" principle. The authority shall assess the loss to the environment and compensate affected individuals/families. The court imposes a pollution fine on tanneries and directs the money to be deposited in an environment protection fund for compensating affected persons and restoring the damaged environment. The authority shall frame schemes for reversing the damage caused by pollution in Tamil Nadu.

The court order requires the closure of polluting industries in Tamil Nadu and the implementation of schemes to reverse environmental damage. Tanneries in five districts are allowed to continue operating if they set up pollution control devices and obtain consent from the Board by a certain date. The order also prohibits new industries from being set up in the prohibited area and requires compliance with water quality standards. The Madras High Court is requested to monitor the implementation of these measures. Mr. M.C. Mehta is commended for his assistance and awarded legal fees.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India received a public interest petition against the pollution caused by untreated effluent from tanneries
