In a recent court order, the petitioner was seeking permission to export seafans, which are a type of coral. The government had imposed a ban on the export of seafans, citing that they fell under the negative list of exports as per the EXIM policy of the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. The petitioner argued that seafans were not covered under the definition of wild animals and were not included in the negative list, and therefore the ban was unjustified. However, the court ruled that seafans could be considered a part of the animal kingdom and fell under the definition of wild life, and therefore the ban was justified. The court also noted that the ban was in the interest of preserving the environment and preventing damage to delicate ecosystems. The writ petition was dismissed.
