The Indian Supreme Court has issued a court order that prohibits the sale and registration of vehicles that do not meet the Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) emission standards in India. The order, which came into effect on April 1, 2017, applies to all manufacturers and dealers in the country. The only exception is for vehicles that have already been sold on or before March 31, 2017, and can provide proof of sale.

The court has emphasized the potential health hazard to millions of people due to increased air pollution and has directed that the commercial interests of manufacturers and dealers cannot take primacy over public health. The court has also noted that the manufacturers of such vehicles were fully aware of the requirement to manufacture only BS-IV compliant vehicles from April 1, 2017, but chose not to take sufficient proactive steps.

The Bharat Stage emission standards are the equivalent of the Euro emission standards used in Europe. The BS-IV emission standards were introduced in India in 2010 and were supposed to be implemented nationwide by April 1, 2017. The standards are designed to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants emitted by vehicles, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.

The court order is a significant step towards reducing air pollution in India, which is one of the most polluted countries in the world. According to the World Health Organization, 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Air pollution is a major health hazard in the country, with an estimated 1.2 million deaths per year attributed to air pollution.

The court order is also a significant blow to the automotive industry in India, which has been struggling with declining sales in recent years. The industry has been lobbying the government to delay the implementation of the BS-IV emission standards, arguing that it would be too costly and would lead to job losses. However, the court has rejected these arguments, stating that public health must take precedence over commercial interests.

The court order is likely to have a significant impact on the automotive industry in India, as manufacturers and dealers will have to adjust their production and sales strategies to comply with the new regulations. The order is also likely to lead to a surge in demand for BS-IV compliant vehicles, as consumers rush to purchase vehicles before the deadline.

In conclusion, the court order prohibiting the sale and registration of vehicles that do not meet the Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) emission standards in India is a significant step towards reducing air pollution in the country. The order emphasizes the importance of public health over commercial interests and is likely to have a significant impact on the automotive industry in India. The court's decision is a positive development for the environment and public health in India and should be welcomed by all stakeholders.
