The court has granted bail to Juned, who was accused of offenses under Sections 379, 420, 429, 120-B of I.P.C. and Sections 9/51, 44, 48, 48-A, 58 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Section 4/25 of Arms Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that co-accused had already been granted bail, and the court allowed the bail application on the same grounds. The accused petitioner must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each to be released on bail.

The case against Juned involved multiple charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Wild Life Protection Act, and the Arms Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that Juned should be granted bail on the same grounds as his co-accused, who had already been granted bail. The court agreed with this argument and granted bail to Juned.

In order to be released on bail, Juned must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. This is a standard requirement for bail in India, and is meant to ensure that the accused will appear in court for all future hearings.

The charges against Juned are serious, and include offenses related to theft, fraud, and the illegal possession of firearms. The Wild Life Protection Act charges are related to the alleged poaching of wild animals. These charges carry significant penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

It is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that Juned has been acquitted of the charges against him. He will still need to appear in court for all future hearings, and will need to defend himself against the charges. However, the granting of bail does allow him to be released from custody while he awaits trial.

Overall, the granting of bail to Juned is a significant development in this case. It will allow him to be released from custody and to prepare his defense against the charges. However, the charges against him are serious, and he will still need to appear in court for all future hearings.
