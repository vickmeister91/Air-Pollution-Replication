The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of eviction filed by landlords against tenants on the grounds of bonafide commercial requirement. In the first case, Sh. Sardar Gurdeep Singh filed a case against Sh. Nitin Chandra, claiming that he needed the property for himself and his family members. The court heard both parties and examined the evidence presented before it. The court found that the petitioner had made a prima facie case for eviction and granted him leave to defend. The court also noted that the burden of proof was on the landlord to prove his requirements and that his assertion needed to be tested.

In the second case, the petitioner claimed to be the landlord and owner of a tenanted property and wanted to evict the tenant to accommodate his son and granddaughter for commercial purposes. The court cited various judgments to establish that the landlord has complete freedom to use his property as he deems fit and that the tenant cannot dictate terms to the landlord. The court found the petitioner's claim of bonafide requirement to be genuine and rejected the tenant's allegations of insufficient income and re-letting at higher rent. The court also recognized the moral duty of a father to help establish his son and allowed the petitioner to use the property for commercial purposes.

In the third case, the landlord's son, who is a chartered accountant, required the tenancy premises for his office, and it was the moral obligation of the landlord to contribute to his son's economic independence. The tribunal found that the son's desire to start his own business from the tenanted property was a bonafide requirement to increase their financial status and standard of living. The respondent's arguments that the nature of the business and the suitability of the shop have not been disclosed were rejected. The court found that no triable issues had been raised by the respondent, and the application for leave to defend was rejected. An eviction order was passed against the respondent for the suit property, but it would not be executable for six months from the date of the order. The parties were left to bear their own costs.

In all three cases, the court considered the landlord's claim of bonafide commercial requirement and examined the evidence presented before it. The court also recognized the moral duty of a father to help establish his son and allowed the landlords to use the property for commercial purposes. The court also noted that the burden of proof was on the landlord to prove his requirements and that his assertion needed to be tested. In the first case, the court granted the petitioner leave to defend, while in the second and third cases, the court rejected the tenant's arguments and passed an eviction order against them. However, in the third case, the eviction order was not executable for six months from the date of the order. 

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of presenting strong evidence to support claims of bonafide commercial requirement and the burden of proof that lies with the landlord. The court also recognizes the moral duty of a father to help establish his son and allows the landlords to use the property for commercial purposes. However, the court also ensures that tenants are not unfairly evicted and grants them leave to defend if they can present a prima facie case.
