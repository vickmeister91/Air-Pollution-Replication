The Supreme Court of India has dismissed an appeal made by Deendayal Port Trust against the State of Gujarat and others. The court stated that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had rightly held that the prayers made by the appellant did not fall within the scope of Sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court also clarified that the appellant can always move an application to the NGT, which will be decided on its merits. The appeal has been disposed of, and pending applications, if any, have also been disposed of.

The case involved a dispute between Deendayal Port Trust and the State of Gujarat over the construction of a jetty. The port trust had sought permission to construct a jetty in the Gulf of Kutch, which was opposed by the state government. The matter was taken to the NGT, which dismissed the port trust's application on the grounds that it did not fall within the scope of Sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The port trust then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the NGT had erred in dismissing its application. The court, however, upheld the NGT's decision, stating that the prayers made by the appellant did not fall within the scope of Sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court also clarified that the appellant can always move an application to the NGT, which will be decided on its merits.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The act empowers the NGT to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues and to provide relief and compensation for damages caused to the environment.

The act also provides for the establishment of state-level green tribunals to hear cases relating to environmental issues at the state level. The act empowers the NGT and state-level green tribunals to hear cases relating to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, including the right to clean air, water, and soil.

The Supreme Court's decision in this case reaffirms the importance of the NGT in the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court's decision also highlights the need for parties to carefully consider the scope of the NGT's jurisdiction before filing an application.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this case is a significant development in the field of environmental law in India. The decision reaffirms the importance of the NGT in the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The decision also highlights the need for parties to carefully consider the scope of the NGT's jurisdiction before filing an application.
