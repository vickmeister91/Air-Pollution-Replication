The defense also disputed the presence of the raiding team at the spot and the genuineness of the case property. However, the court found that the prosecution witnesses' testimony was well-corroborated and that minor contradictions did not discredit their testimony. The court also found that the identification of the case property by the Wildlife Inspector was reliable.
