The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the accused had allegedly received Rs. 53 lakhs from the complainant for constructing and conveying an apartment in a gated community, but failed to do so. The accused had filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for a direction to the complainant to produce all the documents of the property in dispute and Income Tax Return of the complainant. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the documents called for by the accused were not necessary for the just decision of the case and were only being used as a delay tactic.

The court cited previous judgments to support its decision and dismissed the Criminal Original Petition. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the documents he was seeking were necessary for the just decision of the case. The court also noted that the accused had not provided any explanation as to why he needed the Income Tax Return of the complainant.

The court's decision was in line with previous judgments that have held that the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. should be limited to those that are necessary for the just decision of the case. The court noted that the accused had failed to show how the documents he was seeking were necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also noted that the accused had not provided any explanation as to why he needed the Income Tax Return of the complainant. The court held that the accused was merely using the request for documents as a delay tactic and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. should be limited to those that are necessary for the just decision of the case. The court's decision also serves as a warning to litigants who may attempt to use requests for documents as a delay tactic.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. should be limited to those that are necessary for the just decision of the case. The court's decision also serves as a warning to litigants who may attempt to use requests for documents as a delay tactic.
