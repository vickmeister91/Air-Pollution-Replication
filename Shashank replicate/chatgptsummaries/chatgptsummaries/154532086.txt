The court order summaries provided relate to multiple appeals filed by different individuals against the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan, and other government officials and agencies. The appeals pertain to issues such as land acquisition, compensation, and rehabilitation. The details of each case are not provided in the summaries, but the court order lists the names and details of several individuals, including their caste and place of residence, who are involved in three separate appeals.

One of the appeals relates to the conversion of forest land for residential purposes, which was challenged by the Forest Department. The matter was adjourned sine-die by the learned Single Bench until an application under Rule 14(4) of the Rajasthan Land Revenue (Allotment of land for Agriculture Purposes) Rules is disposed of by the Collector, Udaipur. The appellants have challenged this order and are seeking a decision without waiting for the outcome of the proceedings before the Collector.

The court order states that the issues raised in the proceedings before the Collector have already been addressed by the Revenue Board, and therefore, the Collector cannot deliberate on them again. The court requests that the writ petitions be decided without waiting for the outcome of the proceedings pending before the Collector. The proceedings under Section 14(4) of the Rajasthan Land Revenue (Allotment of land for Agriculture Purposes) Rules are not the subject matter of challenge before the court, and the deferment of the hearing of the writ petitions on the ground of pendency of the proceedings before the Collector is found untenable. The order dated 29.11.2017 is set aside, and the appeals are disposed of accordingly.
