The Bombay High Court recently issued a series of orders related to the Aarey Milk Colony in Mumbai, which has been at the center of a controversy over the construction of a metro car shed and the destruction of trees and the Mithi river. The court heard multiple writ petitions filed by environmental activists and residents of Mumbai seeking to declare the entire area of Aarey Colony as a 'Reserved Forest' or a 'Protected Forest' under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and to stop all ongoing construction/development/land filling activities inside Aarey.

The first petition, filed by Vanashakti and others, sought to protect the Aarey Milk Colony in Mumbai from being used for the construction of a metro car shed. The second petition, filed by Zoru Darayus Bhathena, sought to prevent the cutting of trees and destruction of the Mithi river for the construction of a stormwater drain. The respondents included the Union of India, the State of Maharashtra, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., and various government departments and agencies.

The court reserved its judgment on October 1, 2019, and declared it on October 4, 2019. The court order clarified the meaning of the word "forest" and stated that it includes all statutorily recognized forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise. The court also noted that the definition of a forest is not clearly defined and that the State of Maharashtra has not formulated any policy to determine the extent of land or tree coverage required to qualify as a forest. The issue is pending consideration before the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal.

The court order also discussed a Division Bench decision regarding the use of land in Aarey Milk Colony for a metro car shed. The Division Bench noted that the land was not a forest area and that the issue of eco-sensitive zones was pending before the National Green Tribunal. The petitioners have challenged this decision before the Supreme Court, arguing that the land is rich in flora and fauna and should not be used for a metro car shed. The court order provides details of the legal proceedings and challenges to the notifications regarding the change in land use.

The court order directs the National Green Tribunal to proceed with and decide on a case related to the eco-sensitive zone Notification dated 5th December 2016, and to expeditiously proceed and decide on a writ petition related to the same issue. The court also orders a stay on all construction work related to the car shed/workshop until the above-mentioned writ petition in the Bombay High Court and the OA in the NGT, Pune are finally decided. The court emphasizes that the appropriate forum to be approached is the Supreme Court concerning the issue of the area to be declared as a reserved forest or a protected forest and the eco-sensitive zone Notification dated 5th December 2016. The court dismisses the writ petition and the PIL without any order as to costs.

The court order presents the pleadings and material relied upon by the petitioners, but does not make a final decision on the plea to declare Aarey as a forest or an eco-sensitive zone. The order refers to various communications and reports highlighting the forest-like characteristics of the land and the need to preserve it. The order also mentions a withdrawn application before the National Green Tribunal seeking to declare Aarey as a forest or an eco-sensitive zone. The land in question has not been declared as reserved or protected forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and a previous decision by the court in Writ Petition (L) No. 2766/2017 binds this bench and operates as res judicata.

The court order pertains to the conversion of 33 hectares of land in Aarey Colony from a "No Development Zone" to a "Metro Car Depot/Workshop and allied uses". The petitioner had filed a case seeking a declaration of the entire Aarey Colony as a "Reserved forest" or a "Protected forest". The court clarified the meaning of the word "forest" and stated that it includes all statutorily recognized forests, whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise. The petitioner had also sought an order to stop all construction work in Aarey Milk Colony until the case is finally heard.
