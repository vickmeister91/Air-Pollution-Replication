The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chennai recently heard five appeals filed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board against the consolidated order of the Commissioner of Income-tax. The Board had sought exemption under section 10(23)(iv) of the Income Tax Act, but no notification was issued for granting exemption. The issue of grant of exemption was pending before the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court, and the Tribunal restored the issues in the appeals to the file of the Assessing Officer for re-adjudication after considering the directions issued by the High Court. The appeals were partly allowed for statistical purposes.

The case revolves around the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board's (TNPCB) request for exemption under section 10(23)(iv) of the Income Tax Act. This section provides for exemption of income received by any university or other educational institution existing solely for educational purposes and not for profit. The TNPCB had argued that it was a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and was therefore eligible for exemption under this section.

However, the Commissioner of Income-tax had rejected the TNPCB's claim for exemption, stating that it did not meet the criteria for exemption under section 10(23)(iv). The TNPCB then filed five appeals against this decision, which were heard by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chennai.

During the hearing, the Tribunal noted that the issue of grant of exemption was pending before the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court. The High Court had issued directions in this regard, which the Tribunal considered while hearing the appeals. After considering the High Court's directions, the Tribunal restored the issues in the appeals to the file of the Assessing Officer for re-adjudication.

The Tribunal's decision means that the Assessing Officer will have to re-examine the TNPCB's claim for exemption under section 10(23)(iv) in light of the High Court's directions. The appeals were partly allowed for statistical purposes, which means that the Tribunal did not make a final decision on the TNPCB's claim for exemption, but rather sent the case back to the Assessing Officer for further examination.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the criteria for exemption under section 10(23)(iv) of the Income Tax Act. While the TNPCB argued that it was eligible for exemption as a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Commissioner of Income-tax rejected this claim. The case also underscores the role of the High Court in resolving disputes related to income tax exemptions.

In conclusion, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chennai recently heard five appeals filed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board against the consolidated order of the Commissioner of Income-tax. The Board had sought exemption under section 10(23)(iv) of the Income Tax Act, but no notification was issued for granting exemption. The issue of grant of exemption was pending before the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court, and the Tribunal restored the issues in the appeals to the file of the Assessing Officer for re-adjudication after considering the directions issued by the High Court. The appeals were partly allowed for statistical purposes.
