The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case in which an employee of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board was promoted to the post of Environmental Engineer, but later reverted to the feeder post of Environmental Engineer due to alleged erroneous procedure. The petitioner challenged the reversion, claiming that his eligibility and other incidental issues were considered and examined by the selection committee, and a conscious decision was taken upon application of mind. The respondents argued that the promotion was based on an erroneous procedure and flouted government norms and the Board's own service regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a judgment on April 11, 2019.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner who was reverted to a feeder post after being promoted to the post of Senior Environmental Engineer. The court found that the decision to cancel the promotion and revert the petitioner was taken after receiving the opinion of the Principal Secretary of the concerned department, which was treated by the Board as a directive. The court also found that the petitioner was not given an opportunity of hearing before the decision was taken. The court rejected the respondent's argument that the petitioner had no legally protected right that was infringed and upheld the writ petition.

The court order discusses the importance of following the rules of natural justice for doing substantial justice, rather than just completing a hearing as a mere ritual. The order also mentions exceptions to the principle of natural justice, where a fair hearing would make no difference and no legal duty to provide a hearing arises. However, such exceptions can only be resorted to when the facts are indisputable and non-compliance with natural justice causes no prejudice to the party complaining. The order also highlights the importance of autonomy of a statutory body, and how it should not feel bound by the directives of the government. The court concludes that the Board had abdicated its authority in favor of the government, and that the decision taken under the dictate of a different authority is contrary to the nature of the power conferred on the authority.

The court order states that the Member Secretary of the Board was not bound by the opinion expressed by the Principal Secretary as there was no provision for the Board to act under the government's dictates. The court cites previous cases where discretionary power must be exercised by designated officials and not dictated by external authorities. The Board's decision to interpret the opinion as a direction without independent application of mind was deemed illegal, and the court set aside the order. The petitioner is to be restored to the promotional post and receive financial benefits within a specified time frame. No costs were awarded, and parties may request a certified copy of the order.
