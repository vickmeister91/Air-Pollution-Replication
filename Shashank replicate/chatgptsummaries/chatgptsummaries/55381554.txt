The Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur heard a public interest litigation petition filed by a journalist and advocate seeking to declare certain mining rules as illegal and ultra vires the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner also sought directions to the state government to frame rules in compliance with the Environment Impact Assessment Notification dated 14.9.2006. The court examined the Notification and its provisions for screening, scoping, and appraisal of projects and activities, public consultation, and environmental clearance monitoring. The court also noted the validity period of environmental clearance and transferability of environmental clearance to another legal person.

The court order discusses the requirement for obtaining environmental clearance before allotting mines or executing mining leases. The order cites the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 as laws aimed at protecting the environment and preserving forests. The court also refers to the EIA Notification of 2006, which mandates prior environmental clearance for mining activities with a lease area of 5 hectares and above. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and the protection of flora and fauna. The order also mentions a landmark case concerning mining activities in Haryana and expresses concern over the adverse environmental impact of sand extraction from rivers. The Supreme Court dismissed a Special Leave petition filed against the judgment.

The Supreme Court ordered the Ministry of Environment and Forests to create guidelines for quarrying and mining of minor minerals, as their collective impact on the environment can be significant. The guidelines should address issues such as the definition of minor minerals, minimum lease size, lease period, cluster approach for small mines, depth of mining, and reclamation of mined-out areas. The report recommended that mining of minor minerals should be subjected to strict regulatory parameters, and a comprehensive mines plan should be prepared for contiguous stretches of mineral deposits. The report also recommended the creation of a separate corpus for reclamation and rehabilitation of mined-out areas.

The court order requires Union Territories to regulate mining of minor minerals under an approved framework of mining plan that includes reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas. The court also directs all states to implement the recommendations made by the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the Ministry of Mines, including obtaining environmental clearance for leases of minor minerals less than five hectares. The order also notes that sand mining can have adverse effects on biodiversity and soil structure, and calls for an effective framework of mining plan to address environmental issues. The petitioner alleges that the State of Rajasthan amended its Minor Mineral Concession Rules in violation of the court order and MoEF Notification, and inserted Rules 37P to 37U to bypass or ignore the requirements of environmental clearance. These rules require an Environment Management Plan for clusters of leases/licenses/short term permit areas less than five hectares, to be prepared by association of lessees/licensees/short term permit holders and approved by the District Level Environmental Committee. The District Level Environmental Committee consists of the District Collector, Regional Officer of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, Deputy Conservator of Forest, and Assistant Mining Engineer.

The court order outlines the responsibilities of various officers and associations in implementing an Environment Management Plan (EMP) for mining operations in Rajasthan. The EMP includes measures to control air and noise pollution, manage water resources, and restore flora and fauna. Failure to comply with the EMP may result in the cancellation of mining leases or permits. Lessees and permit holders must obtain consent from the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and implement strict conditions to operate. They must also take measures to protect water resources, control vehicular emissions, and ensure the safety of personnel working in dusty areas. Additionally, they must contribute to an environment management fund to support environmental protection work.

The court order requires that accumulated un-potable rainwater be diverted to nearby bodies of water, and water harvesting should be used to recharge the groundwater table. A water treatment plant should be set up where necessary, and a detailed hydro-geological study should be carried out for working below the groundwater level. The order also includes provisions for corporate social responsibility, such as health check-up camps for workers and insurance coverage. An Environmental Management Fund is to be created for environment development work, and the procedure for collecting the fund is outlined. The court finds that the amended rules are in conflict with previous notifications and recommendations, and that the Environmental Management Plan for clusters of leases/licenses/short term permit areas does not conform to the conditions of the environmental clearance provided under the Notification of the MoEF dated 14th September 2006. The court also notes that the amended rules do not involve the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and do not provide for screening, scoping, and appraisal.

The court order discusses amendments made to the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 for systematic, scientific, and environment-friendly mining. The amendments require compliance after the mining lease, quarry license, or short term permit is granted or renewed. The court orders the Secretary of Mines, State of Rajasthan, to file an affidavit verifying the compliance of the amendments. The court also requests details of the approvals given to the mining plan, simplified or modified mining plan or scheme under the amended rules. The court also asks for details of the collections in the corpus of Environment Management Fund and the expenditure of the amount. The court orders the matter to be listed again on 10th February 2015. An affidavit is filed by the Principal Secretary, Department of Mines and Petroleum, Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur, stating that
