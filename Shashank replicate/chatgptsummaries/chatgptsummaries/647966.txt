The court order in question pertains to a case registered by the Forest Department under the Wildlife Protection Act. The case involves the alleged chasing and killing of a wild animal by the applicants, who have been arrested and are currently in custody. The counsel for the applicants argues that only dogs were involved in the incident and that the Forest Department has arrested them without any basis.

The court, without expressing any view on the merits of the case, grants bail to two of the applicants, Summilal and Indar, who have been in custody for over two months. They are to be released on furnishing a bond of Rs.20,000 each with one surety bond of the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The Wildlife Protection Act is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, capturing, killing or otherwise harming any wild animal or bird, and provides for penalties for violations of its provisions.

In this case, the Forest Department has alleged that the applicants chased and killed a wild animal, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The counsel for the applicants, however, argues that only dogs were involved in the incident and that the Forest Department has arrested them without any basis.

The court, while granting bail to two of the applicants, does not express any view on the merits of the case. This means that the court is not making a judgment on whether the applicants are guilty or innocent of the charges against them. Rather, the court is simply granting bail to the applicants, which means that they will be released from custody while the trial is ongoing.

The conditions of the bail require the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs.20,000 each with one surety bond of the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial court. This means that the applicants must provide a sum of money as security for their release, and must also provide a surety bond from someone who is willing to vouch for their good behavior and appearance in court.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Wildlife Protection Act in protecting wild animals and plants from harm. It also demonstrates the role of the court in ensuring that justice is served in cases involving violations of the Act. While the court does not express any view on the merits of the case, its decision to grant bail to the applicants ensures that they will have the opportunity to defend themselves in court while also ensuring that they do not remain in custody for an extended period of time.
