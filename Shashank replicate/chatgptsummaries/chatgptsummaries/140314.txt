State of U.P. and the judgement passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the context of the case. Rama Shankar Alias Gelhan is an accused in Case Crime No.129 of 2010, which is presumably a criminal case. He had applied for bail, but his application had not been decided upon by the lower court. In such a situation, Gelhan approached the higher court under Section 482 Cr.P.C., which empowers the court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice.

The court, in its order, has directed Gelhan to surrender before the lower court within two weeks and apply for bail. The court has also specified that his application shall be considered and decided in accordance with the law laid down by the Seven Judges' decision of the Court in the case of Amrawati and another Vs. State of U.P. and the judgement passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P.

The Seven Judges' decision of the Court in the case of Amrawati and another Vs. State of U.P. pertains to the grant of bail in non-bailable offences. The court had laid down certain guidelines to be followed by the courts while considering bail applications in such cases. The guidelines include the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses, and the prima facie satisfaction of the court regarding the involvement of the accused in the offence.

The judgement passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P. pertains to the grant of bail in cases where the accused is charged with an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. The court had held that while considering bail applications in such cases, the courts must take into account the gravity of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses, and the prima facie satisfaction of the court regarding the involvement of the accused in the offence.

Thus, the court order in question directs the lower court to consider Gelhan's bail application in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Seven Judges' decision of the Court in the case of Amrawati and another Vs. State of U.P. and the judgement passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P. This implies that the lower court must take into account the nature and gravity of the offence, Gelhan's antecedents, the likelihood of him fleeing from justice or tampering with evidence, and the prima facie satisfaction of the court regarding his involvement in the offence while deciding upon his bail application.

It is important to note that the court has not granted bail to Gelhan in its order. It has merely directed the lower court to consider his bail application in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Seven Judges' decision of the Court in the case of Amrawati and another Vs. State of U.P. and the judgement passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh Vs. State of U.P. The decision to grant or deny bail to Gelhan will be taken by the lower court after considering all relevant factors.
