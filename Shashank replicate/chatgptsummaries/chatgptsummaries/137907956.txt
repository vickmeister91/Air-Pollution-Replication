The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife. The Act also provides for the punishment of offenders who violate its provisions.

In this case, the petitioners are accused of hunting birds that are protected under the Act. The petitioners claim that they had a license to hunt from the Tahsildar under Section 249 of the M.P Land Revenue Code, 1959. Section 249 of the M.P Land Revenue Code, 1959 provides for the grant of licenses for hunting, fishing, and trapping on government land. The section also provides for the regulation of such activities and the imposition of fees and penalties for violations.

The court has directed the petitioners to provide information about the rules made under Section 249 (2) so that a harmonious construction of the Wild Life Protection Act and the provisions of M.P.L.R.C., 1959 can be made. Section 249 (2) of the M.P Land Revenue Code, 1959 empowers the state government to make rules for the grant of licenses for hunting, fishing, and trapping on government land. The rules may prescribe the conditions for the grant of licenses, the fees to be charged, and the penalties for violations.

The court's direction to the petitioners to provide information about the rules made under Section 249 (2) is significant as it seeks to ensure that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act and the M.P.L.R.C., 1959 are read together in a harmonious manner. The court's direction also highlights the importance of ensuring that licenses for hunting, fishing, and trapping are granted in a regulated manner and that the fees and penalties for violations are prescribed in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The case has been listed for hearing after one week, indicating that the court is keen to resolve the matter expeditiously. It remains to be seen how the court will interpret the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act and the M.P.L.R.C., 1959 in this case and whether the petitioners will be found guilty of violating the provisions of the Act. However, the court's direction to the petitioners to provide information about the rules made under Section 249 (2) is a positive step towards ensuring that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act are enforced in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Act.
