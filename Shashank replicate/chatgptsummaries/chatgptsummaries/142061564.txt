The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by members of cooperative banks in Kerala, both of which relate to the election process of the banks' managing committees. In the first case, the petitioners objected to the candidature of the fifth respondent, alleging that he had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for killing a wild elephant and appropriating its tusks. The court refused to interfere with the electoral process, as the petitioners had not submitted their objections within the time stipulated in the election notification. The court also noted that there was no evidence to support the petitioners' contention that the returning officer had suppressed their objections. The court held that the proper remedy for the petitioners was to file an election petition after the election was over.

In the second case, the petitioners sought to challenge the election of certain candidates who they believed were disqualified. The court clarified that if candidates were disqualified in an election, their election could be challenged through a dispute under the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act. However, the dispute must have arisen after the General Body Meeting for the election. The court dismissed the writ petition but clarified that the dismissal did not affect the petitioners' right to challenge the election through a properly framed election petition after the election was over.

These court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and timelines in the election process of cooperative banks. In the first case, the court emphasized that objections to candidature must be submitted within the time stipulated in the election notification. Failure to do so may result in the court refusing to interfere with the electoral process. In the second case, the court clarified that disputes regarding disqualification of candidates must arise after the General Body Meeting for the election. This ensures that the election process is fair and transparent, and that all candidates have an equal opportunity to contest the election.

Furthermore, these court orders also emphasize the importance of filing election petitions after the election is over if there are any disputes or objections. This is the proper remedy for any grievances related to the election process. It allows for a thorough investigation of the matter and ensures that the election results are fair and just.

In conclusion, these court orders serve as a reminder to all members of cooperative banks in Kerala to follow proper procedures and timelines in the election process. It is important to submit objections within the time stipulated in the election notification and to raise any disputes after the General Body Meeting for the election. If there are any grievances related to the election process, the proper remedy is to file an election petition after the election is over. By following these procedures, the election process can be fair, transparent, and just for all candidates.
