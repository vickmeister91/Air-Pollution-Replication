The case of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad against the Union of India and others has been ongoing for some time. The latest court order pertains to several interlocutory applications related to the petition. One of these applications was regarding the grant of a mining lease to M/S Putambekar Minerals. The court did not make any specific ruling on this matter, but it is likely to be considered further at a later date.

The main focus of the court order was on the use of 395 hectares of Cantonment land belonging to the Army. This land is deemed forest land, and the court ordered that it should be maintained as such. The land is to be used for jungle warfare, but the court directed that no trees should be damaged in the process. This is an important ruling, as it ensures that the forest land will be protected and preserved for future generations.

In addition to the ruling on the use of the Cantonment land, the court also directed the authorities to set up a sewage treatment plant. This is an important step in ensuring that the environment is protected and that the health of local residents is not put at risk. The court also listed two other issues for consideration at a later date, indicating that there may be further rulings in this case in the future.

The fact that the court has listed the applications for hearing on a specific date suggests that there may be further developments in this case in the future.
