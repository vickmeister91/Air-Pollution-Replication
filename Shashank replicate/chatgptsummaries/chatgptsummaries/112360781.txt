The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case involving M/S Super Tannery Ltd. and the State of U.P. regarding the running of tanneries at the regional level. The U.P. Pollution Control Board had proposed granting permission for running tanneries with a stipulation of 50% capacity per unit and directed the District Magistrate to constitute a committee to inspect the tanneries and submit a report.

The court did not pass any order as the matter is pending before the committee, and appropriate orders will be passed after completion of the procedure as per the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The writ petition was disposed of, and the petitioner can challenge any adverse order in appropriate proceedings.

The case revolves around the issue of running tanneries in the region and the impact it has on the environment. The U.P. Pollution Control Board had proposed granting permission for running tanneries with a stipulation of 50% capacity per unit. This was done to ensure that the tanneries do not cause excessive pollution and harm the environment.

The District Magistrate was directed to constitute a committee to inspect the tanneries and submit a report. The committee was tasked with assessing the impact of the tanneries on the environment and determining whether they were operating within the stipulated capacity.

The court did not pass any order as the matter is pending before the committee. The court stated that appropriate orders will be passed after completion of the procedure as per the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This act provides for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water.

The writ petition was disposed of, and the petitioner can challenge any adverse order in appropriate proceedings. This means that the petitioner has the right to challenge any decision made by the committee or the court in the future.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need to regulate industries that have the potential to harm the environment. The court's decision to wait for the committee's report before passing any orders shows a commitment to ensuring that the decision is based on a thorough assessment of the situation.
