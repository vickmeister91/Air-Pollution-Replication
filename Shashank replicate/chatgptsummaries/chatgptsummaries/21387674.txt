The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to Hotel Deodar Villa for violating the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The hotel challenged the notice in court, and the court directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable as per the existing Municipal laws, and the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the aforementioned acts. The court further directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In another case, the court dealt with a violation of municipal laws and construction beyond the sanctioned plan in Himachal Pradesh. The petitioner had raised construction to the extent of 1046.50 square meters, which is beyond the compoundable limits stipulated under the provisions of the H.P. Municipal Act, 1994 and Town and Country Planning Act, 1977. The court dismissed the writ petition and ordered the petitioner to deposit a sum of `2.00 lac as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. All interim orders stand vacated.

The court's decision in the first case highlights the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations related to pollution control. The court has directed the petitioner to provide detailed information about the extent of construction carried out and the deviations made from the sanctioned plan. This information will help the court determine the extent of the violation and the appropriate action to be taken. The court's decision to not take any coercive action till the next date of hearing provides the petitioner with some relief and time to comply with the regulations.

In the second case, the court has dismissed the writ petition and ordered the petitioner to deposit a sum of `2.00 lac as costs. This decision sends a strong message to those who violate municipal laws and construction regulations. The court's decision to vacate all interim orders further strengthens its stance on the matter.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations related to pollution control and construction. Violations of these regulations can lead to legal action and hefty fines. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of these regulations and comply with them to avoid legal complications.
