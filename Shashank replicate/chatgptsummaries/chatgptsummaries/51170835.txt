The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed an appeal by M/s. Laxmi Handicrafts against the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and another party. The court ruled that the appellant must avail the statutory remedies before the National Green Tribunal, as it provides a codified manner for environmental matters and an alternative remedy. The appeal was disposed of to avail the statutory alternate remedy.

The case involved allegations of environmental pollution caused by M/s. Laxmi Handicrafts, which is a manufacturer of handicrafts in Rajasthan. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board had issued a show-cause notice to the company, alleging that it had violated various environmental laws and regulations. The company had challenged the notice before the Rajasthan High Court, which had dismissed the petition on the ground that the company had an alternative remedy before the National Green Tribunal.

The company had then filed an appeal before the Rajasthan High Court, challenging the order of the single judge. The company had argued that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, did not provide for an exclusive remedy and that the company had a right to approach the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The company had also argued that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was not applicable to the present case, as the alleged violations had occurred before the Act came into force.

The Rajasthan High Court, however, rejected the company's arguments and held that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, provided for a codified manner for environmental matters and an alternative remedy. The court observed that the Act was enacted to provide for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court also noted that the Act had been amended in 2011 to make it applicable to cases relating to environmental pollution that had occurred before the Act came into force.

The court further held that the company had not exhausted the statutory remedies available before the National Green Tribunal and that it was not appropriate for the High Court to interfere at this stage. The court observed that the company had a right to approach the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but only after exhausting the statutory remedies before the National Green Tribunal. The court, therefore, dismissed the appeal and directed the company to avail the statutory alternate remedy.

The decision of the Rajasthan High Court is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, in environmental matters. The Act provides for a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act also provides for an alternative remedy, which must be exhausted before approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The decision also highlights the need for companies to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board had issued a show-cause notice to the company, alleging that it had violated various environmental laws and regulations. The company had challenged the notice before the Rajasthan High Court, which had dismissed the petition on the ground that the company had an alternative remedy before the National Green Tribunal. The company had then filed an appeal before the Rajasthan High Court, challenging the order of the single judge. However, the court held that the company had not exhausted the statutory remedies available before the National Green Tribunal and that it was not appropriate for the High Court to interfere at this stage.

In conclusion, the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in the case of M/s. Laxmi Handicrafts reaffirms the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, in environmental matters and highlights the need for companies to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The Act provides for a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act also provides for an alternative remedy, which must be exhausted before approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The decision of the court is a reminder to companies that they must take their environmental responsibilities seriously and comply with the law.
