The court order pertains to a criminal case where the applicants have requested the quashing of a first information report (FIR) registered against them for illegally excavating stones, grits, and minerals from a reserved site. The FIR was lodged under sections 420, 379, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and sections 29 and 51(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicants argued that the first informant did not have the authority to lodge the complaint, and even if he did, the applicants had already been discharged of the offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court agreed with the applicants and quashed the FIR.

The court order states that no person can be prosecuted and punished for the same offense more than once. The first informant was not authorized to lodge a first information report in respect of the offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicants had already been prosecuted in respect of the said offenses and had been discharged. The offense alleged under the Indian Penal Code does not have enough evidence to attract the provisions of the said section. The alleged offense falls within the ambit of section 21 of the Mines and Minerals Act, in respect of which a complaint can be lodged only by a person authorized in that behalf by the Central Government or the State Government under section 22 of the Act. The first information report and all proceedings pursuant thereto stand vitiated as being in contravention of the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Act as well as having been registered at the instance of a person who had no authority of law to lodge such a complaint. The court quashes and sets aside the first information report and the charge-sheet filed pursuant thereto.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process of law while lodging a complaint. The first informant in this case did not have the authority to lodge a complaint under the Wild Life Protection Act, and the applicants had already been discharged of the offenses under the Act. The court also noted that the alleged offense fell within the ambit of the Mines and Minerals Act, and a complaint could only be lodged by a person authorized by the Central or State Government. The court's decision to quash the FIR and the charge-sheet filed pursuant thereto is a reminder that the law must be followed in letter and spirit.

The court's decision also underscores the principle of double jeopardy, which states that no person can be prosecuted and punished for the same offense more than once. The applicants had already been prosecuted in respect of the offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act and had been discharged. The court's decision to quash the FIR and the charge-sheet filed pursuant thereto is in line with this principle.
