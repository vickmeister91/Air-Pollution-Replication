The court order in question pertains to a case where Sandeep has challenged the trial court's rejection of his application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for calling certain documents said to be in possession of the respondent, Abhishek. The case revolves around a complaint filed by Abhishek under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act with the plea that loan of Rs. 2 lakhs was advanced by him to Sandeep on 30th November 2007 for 6 months and the promissory note was also executed.

When the matter reached the stage of final arguments, Sandeep had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for production of certain documents by Abhishek. The trial court rejected the application, and the High Court upheld the decision, stating that no error had been committed by the trial court in rejecting the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order production of documents or other things. It states that the court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, order the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of such inquiry, trial or proceeding.

In this case, Sandeep had sought the production of certain documents by Abhishek, which he claimed were necessary for the purposes of the trial. However, the trial court had rejected his application, and the High Court had upheld the decision, stating that no error had been committed by the trial court in rejecting the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The High Court had observed that the documents sought by Sandeep were not relevant to the case and that the trial court had rightly rejected his application. The court had also noted that Sandeep had failed to establish the relevance of the documents sought by him and that his application was merely an attempt to delay the proceedings.

The court had further observed that the power to order production of documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. is discretionary and that the court may exercise its discretion in the interests of justice. The court had noted that in this case, the trial court had exercised its discretion judiciously and that there was no reason to interfere with its decision.
