The court order pertains to a criminal case that is currently pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Gujarat. The applicant in this case had previously sought clarification on an earlier order that had stayed a non-bailable warrant and dispensed with his personal appearance. The court has now allowed the application and set aside the order for a non-bailable warrant against the applicant.

The court has clarified that the applicant's personal presence during the proceedings is exempted and he can remain present through his advocate. This means that the applicant does not need to be physically present in court and can instead have his lawyer represent him. The court has disposed of the application accordingly.

Unfortunately, the actual court order is not provided in the given text. However, we do know that it was created on a specific date and time. It is possible that the order contains additional details about the case and the reasons behind the court's decision.

Overall, this court order appears to be a positive development for the applicant in the criminal case. By allowing him to be represented by his lawyer instead of requiring his personal appearance, the court has made the legal process more accessible and less burdensome for the applicant. It remains to be seen how this case will ultimately be resolved, but this order is certainly a step in the right direction for the applicant.
