The court order pertains to a case where an employee of a private school claimed that his resignation was obtained under duress and coercion. The petitioner challenged a judgment and order that dismissed his appeal against his termination from service based on a resignation letter. The School Tribunal had held that the resignation was voluntary and dismissed the appeal. The petitioner claimed that he was forced to sign the resignation letter and that it was obtained under duress and coercion. The respondents denied these claims and stated that the resignation was voluntary. The petitioner's counsel argued that the resignation letter was obtained under duress and was in breach of mandatory provisions under Section 7 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (MEPS) Act and Rule 40 of the MEPS Rules, 1981.

The court considered the provisions of Section 7 and Rule 40 and held that they were mandatory. The court also stated that the provisions were intended to protect employees from unscrupulous acts of the management. The Act requires that an employee must execute their resignation in their own handwriting, sign both copies, and send one copy by registered post. If an employee disputes the mode of delivery or execution, the burden of proof falls on the employer to show that the resignation was voluntary. Failure to comply with these requirements renders the resignation involuntary and void ab initio. The court cites several cases to support this interpretation of the law.

The court found that the resignation letter was valid, even though it was tendered within one month of the beginning of the first term, as the procedure prescribed under Rule 40 is for the benefit of the management. The delayed payment or acceptance of notice pay would not lead to an inference that the resignation is invalid or involuntary. The court also noted that the petitioner had handed over the charge to a representative of the teachers and had not disclosed this fact in the appeal memo.

The court order discusses the requirements for a resignation to be considered voluntary and legal under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (MEPS) Act. An employee can leave their job earlier by paying three months' salary or one month's salary in lieu of notice. If the management allows an employee to leave without notice or payment, a proportionate amount will be deducted from the school's grant. The resignation must not be given during vacation or within a month after the beginning of the first term of the year.

In this case, the court found that there was no evidence to support the petitioner's claim that he was coerced into resigning from his job as a teacher. The court noted inconsistencies in the petitioner's statements and found that the School Tribunal had taken a reasonable view based on the evidence presented. The petition was dismissed.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of following the mandatory provisions under the MEPS Act and Rules to ensure that resignations are voluntary and legal. The burden of proof falls on the employer to show that the resignation was voluntary, and failure to comply with the requirements renders the resignation involuntary and void ab initio. The court also notes that the provisions are intended to protect employees from unscrupulous acts of the management. In this case, the court found that the resignation was voluntary and valid, and dismissed the petition.
