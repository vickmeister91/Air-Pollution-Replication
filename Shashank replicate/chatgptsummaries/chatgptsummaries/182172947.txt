The Gujarat High Court received a petition in 2009 from residents of Taluka Jetpur, District Rajkot, seeking direction to prevent and control pollution caused by dyeing, printing, and washing sarees and clothes by various industrial units located in Jetpur. The petitioners requested the court to issue a writ of mandamus and/or writ in nature of mandamus or any other(s) appropriate writ, directions and/or orders, directing the respondents to perform their statutory duties for preventing and controlling pollution.
