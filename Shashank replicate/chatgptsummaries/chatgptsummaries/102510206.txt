The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a case of sexual harassment where the petitioner was charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking relevant documents relating to an internal enquiry conducted by the school against him. The court held that the accused is only entitled to documents which form part of the charge sheet and are relied upon by the investigating agency to prosecute the accused. Since the report of internal enquiry conducted by the school was not part of the charge sheet, the accused cannot claim the same under Section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The court emphasized the importance of a fair trial and noted that while the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to every document in the police file, they are entitled to certain documents under Sections 91, 233, and 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court also cited previous cases to support its position. The court discussed the scope of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the court to direct the production of any document or thing necessary for investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings. The court notes that the power is unlimited but must be exercised based on the stage of the proceedings and the necessity and desirability of the document.

The accused does not have an absolute right to produce any material at the stage of framing of charges, but in rare cases, defense material can be looked into if it convincingly demonstrates that the prosecution case is absurd or concocted. The accused can also claim documents under Section 91 if they can be used to confront prosecution witnesses. The court directs that if an application is filed under Section 91, considering the necessity and desirability of the documents and the stage of trial, the court will allow the same by directing production of the documents to the petitioner.

In summary, the court orders discussed the right of the accused to receive documents and statements submitted before the court, as well as the role and obligation of the prosecutor in relation to disclosure. The court emphasized the importance of a fair trial and noted that while the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to every document in the police file, they are entitled to certain documents under Sections 91, 233, and 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court also discussed the scope of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the court to direct the production of any document or thing necessary for investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings.
