The Gujarat High Court recently heard several petitions related to the use of Type-D gasifier technology by various companies in the Morbi-Wankaner industrial cluster in Gujarat. The court heard the petitions together and issued a common judgment and order. The petitions sought relief from closure orders issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and requested approval for the use of modified Type-D gasifiers. The court granted some of the requested relief and directed the GPCB to examine and evaluate the modified technology. The court also stayed the implementation of closure orders and allowed the companies to continue their manufacturing activities.

The case arose due to the serious issue of pollution caused by ceramic industries in the Morbi-Wankaner cluster in Gujarat. The National Green Tribunal constituted a committee to suggest parameters and standards for coal gasifiers and to monitor their implementation. The committee found that coal gasification generates highly carcinogenic waste and recommended shutting down and dismantling all gasifiers in the area. The court also notes that the Consolidated Consent Authorization given by the GPCB to industries in the area is beyond what is permitted under the law. The court order discusses various measures taken by the GPCB to address the pollution, including issuing notices for closure of polluting units and monitoring ambient air quality.

The court order discusses the non-compliance of industries in Morbi, Gujarat with regards to their use of coal gasifiers. The report highlights issues such as non-operational and non-compliant evaporators, contaminated cooling water, and illegal discharge of wastewater. The court orders the shutdown and dismantling of all type B gasifiers, and encourages the use of cleaner technology such as PNG. The report also emphasizes the need for adequate air pollution control devices and solid waste management. The court stresses the importance of sustainable development and compliance with environmental norms.

The court notes that the Morbi-Wankaner region is one of the polluted industrial clusters and directs the GPCB to close all coal gasifiers industries and units operating with the help of coal gasifiers without prejudice to such units switching over to non-coal gasifiers or PNG or technology consistent with the above report. The GPCB must initiate immediate steps for prosecution of the industries which have operated in violation of law and recover compensation for causing damage to the environment and public health. The court also appoints an Oversight Committee headed by Justice B.C. Patel to oversee the execution of this order by the GPCB.

The court order discusses the use of modified Type D gasifiers in ceramic manufacturing and the closure orders issued by the National Green Tribunal. The petitioner argues that the modified gasifiers are an improved and advanced technology that is consistent with the recommendations of the Committee. They also argue that the closure orders should be withdrawn and the units operating with the new technology should be allowed a trial run to evaluate their pollution compliance. The GPCB opposes the writ application and argues that the petitioner has an alternative remedy of preferring an appeal. The court has not yet made a decision on the matter.

The court order discusses a writ application by a manufacturer of a "Modified Type D Gasifier" seeking evaluation of their technology. However, the National Green Tribunal has already passed an order directing the closure of all coal gasifier industries and units operating with the help of coal gasifier without prejudice to such units switching over to non-coal gasifiers or PNG or other technology. The court notes that the writ applicant has no legal right to claim such evaluation and that the National Green Tribunal has already considered the matter thoroughly. The court also highlights the benefits of switching to cleaner options and the report submitted by the committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal.

The court order discusses the need to shift to advanced fluidized bed gasifiers to reduce pollution in the Morbi region. The Expert Committee has recommended against using gasifiers that generate condensate wastewater and coal tar due to their severe impact on the ecosystem. The court also notes that the National Green Tribunal has already considered the issue and banned the use of coal in gasifier technology. The order emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the precautionary principle of environmental jurisprudence.

The court order states that the use of coal gasifiers for generating coal tar in the Morbi Industrial area is not permitted due to the large amount of hazardous waste generated and the lack of proper waste management. Tractors and trolleys used for transportation of tar are not registered and do not follow proper regulations. The court recommends shutting down all gasifiers of type A and B and switching to cleaner technology such as natural gas. The court also notes that the natural gas grid is already established in the area and most industries have opted for gas connections. The court questions why an exception should be made for the writ applicants who are insisting on using coal gasifiers.

The court order notes that polluters are liable to pay for the cost of remediation of damaged ecology and that the use of coal gasifiers has been banned by the tribunal. The petitioner's claim of using a modified technology cannot be considered as the use of coal has been banned. The court also states that the petitioner should file an appeal before the Supreme Court if they want to challenge the order of the tribunal. The court finds that the writ applicants have not made out any case for the issue of a writ of mandamus to the GPCB. The court also notes the findings of the committee's report on alternate coal gasifiers.

The court order discusses different types of gasifiers used in the ceramic industry and their impact on the
