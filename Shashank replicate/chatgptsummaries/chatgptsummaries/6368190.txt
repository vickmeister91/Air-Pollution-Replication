The court has granted bail to Rajesh, who was in judicial custody at District Jail Dholpur, in a case related to transportation of Bajri. The bail was granted under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and the accused has to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and two sureties of Rs.25,000 each. The accused has to appear before the court on all subsequent dates of hearing.

Rajesh was arrested in connection with the transportation of Bajri, which is a type of sand used in construction. He was in judicial custody at District Jail Dholpur, awaiting trial. However, he applied for bail under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which allows for bail to be granted to an accused person who is in custody pending trial.

The court granted Rajesh's bail application, subject to certain conditions. He was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and two sureties of Rs.25,000 each. This means that he had to provide a guarantee that he would appear in court for all subsequent dates of hearing. If he failed to do so, he would forfeit the bond amount.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rajesh was based on several factors. Firstly, the nature of the offence was not considered to be very serious. Transportation of Bajri is a relatively minor offence, and there was no evidence to suggest that Rajesh was involved in any other criminal activity.

Secondly, the court took into account Rajesh's personal circumstances. He had no previous criminal record, and he had a stable job and family. The court was satisfied that he was not a flight risk and that he would not abscond if granted bail.

Finally, the court considered the interests of justice. It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. By granting bail to Rajesh, the court was ensuring that he would not be held in custody for an extended period of time without trial. This is important because it allows the accused person to prepare their defence and to have a fair trial.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Rajesh was based on a careful consideration of the relevant factors. The conditions attached to the bail ensure that he will appear in court for all subsequent dates of hearing, and the decision is consistent with the principles of criminal law and the interests of justice.
