The Patna High Court has issued an order to the competent authority of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board to form a team of officials to visit the areas of Alamganj and Sultanganj in Patna. The team is tasked with conducting inspections, verifying the allegations made in two petitions concerning the violation of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and submitting a report to the court. The court will take action as permissible in law based on the report submitted by the team.

The order was issued in response to two petitions filed by residents of Alamganj and Sultanganj, alleging that the air quality in their areas has deteriorated due to the presence of polluting industries. The petitioners claimed that the industries were operating without proper pollution control measures, and were emitting harmful pollutants into the air, causing health hazards to the residents.

The court has directed the Pollution Control Board to file a report and affidavit from the competent authority by December 6, 2017. The court has also listed both cases on that date, indicating that it will take further action based on the report submitted by the team.

The order is significant as it highlights the importance of enforcing environmental laws and regulations to protect the health and well-being of citizens. The court's decision to constitute a team of officials to verify the allegations made by the petitioners is a positive step towards ensuring that polluting industries are held accountable for their actions.

The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels, and lays down guidelines for the control of emissions from industries and vehicles.

However, the implementation of the act has been weak, and many industries continue to operate without proper pollution control measures. This has led to a significant deterioration in air quality in many parts of the country, causing serious health hazards to the residents.

The Patna High Court's order is a reminder that environmental laws and regulations must be enforced strictly to protect the health and well-being of citizens. The court's decision to constitute a team of officials to verify the allegations made by the petitioners is a positive step towards ensuring that polluting industries are held accountable for their actions.

It is hoped that the Pollution Control Board will take the court's order seriously and conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made by the petitioners. The board must ensure that the team of officials is given adequate resources and support to carry out their duties effectively.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's order to constitute a team of officials to investigate the allegations of air pollution in Alamganj and Sultanganj is a positive step towards enforcing environmental laws and regulations. The court's decision to take action based on the report submitted by the team is a reminder that polluting industries must be held accountable for their actions. It is hoped that the Pollution Control Board will take the court's order seriously and conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made by the petitioners.
