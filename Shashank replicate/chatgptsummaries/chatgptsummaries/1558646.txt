The court order in question pertains to a revision petition against the dismissal of an application under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. The petitioner had alleged that a company and others were responsible for polluting the air and water of river Chambal, leading to the death of children, animals, and water creatures. The non-applicants contended that previous written sanction of the State Boards constituted under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was necessary. The court held that the learned S.D.M. had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter, which constituted offences under the Water Act and the Air Act. The revision petition was dismissed.

The case at hand involves allegations of pollution of the air and water of river Chambal, which has led to the death of children, animals, and water creatures. The petitioner has accused a company and others of being responsible for this pollution. The non-applicants, on the other hand, have argued that previous written sanction of the State Boards constituted under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was necessary.

The court has examined the arguments put forth by both parties and has come to the conclusion that the learned S.D.M. had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter. The court has held that the alleged offences fall under the purview of the Water Act and the Air Act, and therefore, the State Boards constituted under these Acts are the appropriate authorities to deal with the matter.

The court has also noted that the non-applicants have raised a valid point regarding the requirement of previous written sanction from the State Boards. The court has held that such sanction is indeed necessary before any action can be taken under the Water Act and the Air Act.

In light of these findings, the court has dismissed the revision petition. The court has made it clear that the learned S.D.M. does not have the jurisdiction to proceed with the matter and that the State Boards constituted under the Water Act and the Air Act are the appropriate authorities to deal with the alleged offences.

This court order highlights the importance of following the due process of law when dealing with cases of pollution. The court has made it clear that the State Boards constituted under the Water Act and the Air Act are the appropriate authorities to deal with such cases and that previous written sanction from these Boards is necessary before any action can be taken. This order serves as a reminder to all concerned parties to follow the due process of law and to respect the jurisdiction of the appropriate authorities.
