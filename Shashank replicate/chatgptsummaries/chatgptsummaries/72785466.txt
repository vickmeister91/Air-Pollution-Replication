The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by the Municipal Council of Guna against an interlocutory order by the National Green Tribunal. The order directed the council to remove encroachments and clean the river Gunia/Nigri within one month, failing which the council's Chairman and CMO would be prosecuted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The council argued that the area in question was not under its jurisdiction, but the court declined to interfere in the matter, stating that a distinct mechanism was provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The case began when the National Green Tribunal issued an order directing the Municipal Council of Guna to remove encroachments and clean the river Gunia/Nigri within one month. The order also stated that if the council failed to comply, the Chairman and CMO would be prosecuted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The council filed a petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court challenging the order, arguing that the area in question was not under its jurisdiction.

The High Court, however, declined to interfere in the matter, stating that a distinct mechanism was provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal had the power to issue orders and directions to any person, including government authorities, for the protection of the environment. The court also observed that the council had not challenged the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal in the matter.

The court further noted that the National Green Tribunal had issued the order after considering the report of the Central Pollution Control Board, which had found that the river Gunia/Nigri was highly polluted due to encroachments and discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluents. The court observed that the National Green Tribunal had issued the order in exercise of its powers under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court also rejected the council's argument that the area in question was not under its jurisdiction. The court observed that the council had not produced any evidence to support its claim. The court further noted that the council had not challenged the report of the Central Pollution Control Board, which had clearly identified the area in question as falling within the jurisdiction of the council.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the Municipal Council of Guna and upheld the order of the National Green Tribunal. The court directed the council to comply with the order within one month, failing which the Chairman and CMO would be prosecuted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The case highlights the importance of protecting the environment and the powers of the National Green Tribunal in this regard. The National Green Tribunal has been established as a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The tribunal has the power to issue orders and directions to any person, including government authorities, for the protection of the environment. The tribunal's orders are binding and enforceable, and failure to comply can result in prosecution under the relevant environmental laws.
