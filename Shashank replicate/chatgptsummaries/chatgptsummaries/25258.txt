The Gujarat Pollution Control Board filed a Criminal Revision Application against Rushabh Dye-Chem Industries and two of its partners for alleged offences under Sections 37 and 39 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The learned Magistrate had ordered the discharge of the respondents mainly on the grounds that the complainant failed to produce the copy of notification declaring Ahmedabad as a pollution controlled area and two local daily newspapers publicizing the said notification. However, the court found the discharge to be unjust and illegal, and quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order, remanding the case to the learned Magistrate to be disposed of on merits according to law, after framing the charge.

The court order emphasizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and achieving social justice. It states that all parties involved in the legal process must understand their roles and responsibilities. The court has decided to quash and set aside a previous judgment due to the accused being discharged in an indiscreet manner. The case will be remanded to the trial court to be decided on its merits. The court has decided not to issue notice to the accused and has directed the trial court to hear and decide the case as quickly as possible.
