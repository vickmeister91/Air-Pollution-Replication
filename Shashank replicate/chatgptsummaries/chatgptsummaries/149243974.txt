The Kollam Royal Park Hotel & Resorts filed a writ petition seeking to quash a directive from the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority to stop all activities and remove illegal constructions made in the 'No Development Zone' notified under the Coastal Regulation Zone Regulations. The petitioner argued that the land on which the hotel is constructed was part of a legally designated urban area and therefore cannot be categorized other than a CRZ-II area. The court heard the case on August 10, 2016, and delivered its judgment on August 19, 2016, in favor of the petitioner.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a hotel owner challenging a notice issued by the Coastal Zone Management Authority (2nd respondent) under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, to stop all activities in the hotel complex and remove alleged illegal constructions from the 'No Development Zone'. The petitioner contends that the area where the hotel is located can only be classified as CRZ-II (Coastal Regulation Zone) in the plans being prepared under the CRZ Notification, 2011, and any other categorization would be ultra vires the Notification. The petitioner also argues that there is no violation of the CRZ Notification, 1991, as no new constructions were made and the existing buildings were only re-modelled for making them usable as a hotel. The 2nd respondent, on the other hand, contends that the buildings are situated in the non-development zone of CRZ-III, as per the approved coastal zone management plan of the State, where construction of buildings for activities which are not permissible in the CRZ notification is prohibited. The court will decide whether the notice issued by the 2nd respondent is legally sustainable or not.

The court order discusses the question of whether a notice requires interference through judicial review. The court notes that the property in question is included in the Master Plan for Quilon Town and is near the Kollam Collector's office and KSRTC Bus stand. The court directs the second respondent to consider whether the petitioner's hotel is located in a CRZ-II area while preparing the Coastal Zone Management Plan under the CRZ Notification, 2011. The court allows the writ petition in part and keeps proceedings pursuant to the notice in abeyance until a decision is taken.
