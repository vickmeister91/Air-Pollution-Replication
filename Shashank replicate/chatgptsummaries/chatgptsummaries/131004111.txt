In a recent court order, a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was granted to search and seize the passport of a minor daughter from the custody of her husband. The passport was seized and produced before the court. The petitioner requested to retain the passport so that she may take the child abroad, but the court directed to release the passport to her on her executing a bond with two solvent sureties. The petitioner was directed to produce the passport before the court after performing the journey and at any rate on or before 31.7.2018.

The court dismissed the application under Section 93 Cr.P.C filed by the petitioner as no proceedings under the Cr.P.C were pending when the application was filed. This means that the petitioner's application was not valid as there were no ongoing criminal proceedings at the time of filing. 

The court's decision to grant the petition to search and seize the passport of the minor daughter was likely based on concerns for the child's safety and welfare. It is not clear from the court order what specific circumstances led to this decision, but it is possible that there were concerns about the child being taken out of the country without proper authorization or consent.

The court's decision to release the passport to the petitioner on the condition that she execute a bond with two solvent sureties is a common practice in cases where there is a risk of flight or other concerns about the petitioner's intentions. By requiring the petitioner to provide sureties, the court is essentially ensuring that there is some financial incentive for the petitioner to comply with the court's orders and return the passport as required.

The court's directive that the petitioner produce the passport before the court after performing the journey and at any rate on or before 31.7.2018 is also a common practice in cases where there is a risk of flight or other concerns about the petitioner's intentions. By requiring the petitioner to return the passport to the court after the journey is complete, the court is ensuring that the petitioner does not abscond with the child or otherwise violate the court's orders.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of ensuring the safety and welfare of minors in cases where there are concerns about their custody or travel arrangements. By granting the petition to search and seize the passport of the minor daughter, the court is taking steps to protect the child's interests and ensure that she is not taken out of the country without proper authorization or consent. The court's decision to release the passport to the petitioner on certain conditions is also a common practice in cases where there is a risk of flight or other concerns about the petitioner's intentions.
