The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed two separate orders in cases related to pollution control measures in distilleries. The first order pertains to multiple petitions challenging orders passed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board directing stoppage of production in various distilleries due to pollution. The court emphasized the need for preserving the environment and preventing pollution while also ensuring industrialization and national progress. The court also noted the power of the Pollution Control Board to give directions and the importance of obtaining consent for the discharge of effluent. The court examined the orders challenged in each petition and considered whether the petitioners received a reasonable opportunity to avert drastic action like closure of their units.

The court observed that the Pollution Control Board has the power to give directions to industries to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The court also noted that obtaining consent for the discharge of effluent is an important aspect of pollution control measures. The court emphasized that while industrialization is necessary for national progress, it should not come at the cost of the environment. The court also noted that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The court examined the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board in each petition and found that in some cases, the petitioners were not given a reasonable opportunity to avert drastic action like closure of their units. The court also noted that in some cases, the orders were passed without following the principles of natural justice. The court directed the Pollution Control Board to give the petitioners a reasonable opportunity to comply with the pollution control measures and to pass fresh orders after considering the compliance reports submitted by the petitioners.

In the second order, the court discussed various show cause notices and orders related to pollution control measures for a distillery. The court found that there were violations of natural justice and procedural safeguards in the decision-making process, and thus quashed the orders. The court directed the respondent to issue a fresh show cause notice, giving specific grounds for pollution control measures and remedial actions necessary. The petitioner was restrained from discharging trade effluents into rivers or lakes until a new decision was made. The court emphasized the importance of preventing pollution and maintaining a clean environment.

The court observed that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and that it is the duty of the state to protect and improve the environment. The court noted that the distillery had violated the pollution control measures and that it was necessary to take remedial actions to prevent further pollution. The court directed the respondent to issue a fresh show cause notice, giving specific grounds for pollution control measures and remedial actions necessary. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with the pollution control measures and to refrain from discharging trade effluents into rivers or lakes until a new decision was made.

In both orders, the court emphasized the importance of preventing pollution and maintaining a clean environment. The court noted that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and that it is the duty of the state to protect and improve the environment. The court also noted that industrialization is necessary for national progress, but it should not come at the cost of the environment. The court directed the Pollution Control Board and the respondent to take necessary measures to prevent pollution and protect the environment.
