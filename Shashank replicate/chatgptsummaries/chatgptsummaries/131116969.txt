The court order pertains to a petition filed by Harsh Kumar seeking the quashing of a First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and other acts. The FIR was registered in connection with the Forest Hill Golf and Country Club in village Karoran, Distt. Ropar, which was alleged to have been set up in violation of environmental and forest laws. The court had taken suo moto notice of the matter and directed the CBI to conduct a thorough probe.

The petitioner had submitted two diametrically opposed reports with respect to the environmental devastation caused by the club, which had led to adverse comments by the court. The court dismissed the petitioner's review petition and upheld the observations made against him. The court order acknowledges the limitations of returning a firm finding of fact in exceptional cases. The allegations against the petitioner are serious, but the material on record is not conclusive. The court did not express any final opinion on the matters mentioned in the case.

The petitioner is accused of demanding illegal gratification and forging signatures on a complaint against Forest Hill Resort. The C.B.I. alleges that the petitioner manipulated the complaint and exonerated Lt. Col. B.S. Sandhu of the allegations. The petitioner denies the allegations and argues that no case is made out against him. The final report has been presented and is pending consideration before the trial court.

The court order states that the court cannot quash the FIR or the final report as it is the primary adjudicatory forum to decide culpability or innocence of an accused. The court should tread cautiously while appraising an FIR and the material placed before it. The court cannot determine the chance of conviction or acquittal based on probabilities and possibilities. The court cannot traverse facts that would require it to appraise the reports so as to record an opinion for or against the allegations levelled against the petitioner. The court finds no reason to quash the FIR and the proceedings emanating therefrom. The court dismisses the present petition.
