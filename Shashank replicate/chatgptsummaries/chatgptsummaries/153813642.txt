The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking the cancellation of the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Excavation Project awarded to M/s.Gem Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. The petitioner claimed that the project would be detrimental to the soil and fertility of the area and alleged that the project was awarded due to political influence. The petitioner also made specific allegations against persons close to M/s.Gem Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.

The court noted that the petitioner did not provide sufficient evidence to support their allegations and that the proper forum for adjudication of environmental issues is the National Green Tribunal. The court dismissed the writ petition and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of any grievances regarding environmental pollution.

The court order also addressed the issue of misjoinder and non-joinder of parties. The petitioner had made specific allegations against Ministers and Members of Parliament, but they had not been impleaded as parties. The court cited Order I Rule IX of the Civil Procedure Code, which deals with Mis-joinder and Non-joinder of parties, and observed that the court can deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. The court also noted the distinction between misdescription or misnomer of a party and misjoinder or non-joinder of a party suing or being sued.

The court order stated that while a misdescription of a party will not be fatal to the maintainability of a suit/proceeding, care must be taken to ensure that the necessary party is before the court, otherwise the suit/proceeding will fail. In this case, the necessary parties had not been impleaded, and therefore the court could not adjudicate on the matter.

The court order involved W.P.No.10008 of 2017 and W.M.P.Nos.11015 and 11016 of 2017. The Chief Secretary to Government and the Secretary to Government of Tamil Nadu were both involved in the order. The order was issued on February 28, 2019, and can be found on the website http://www.judis.nic.in.
