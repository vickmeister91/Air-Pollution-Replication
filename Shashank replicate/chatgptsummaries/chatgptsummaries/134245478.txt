The Rajasthan High Court recently received a petition from M/s Inven Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, seeking the quashing of a complaint and all proceedings arising from Criminal Case No. 1013/2015 titled State of Rajasthan vs. M/s. Inven Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. The company was accused of manufacturing sub-standard drugs. The court ruled that the complaint could not be quashed solely on the grounds that the sample was declared sub-standard, and that the petitioners would have the opportunity to argue at the time of consideration of charges. The court also examined the responsibilities of the company's directors and managers under the India Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

The court order explains the legal requirements for a person to be held vicariously liable under Section 141 of the Companies Act. Only certain individuals, such as managing directors, whole-time directors, managers, and secretaries, can be held responsible for the conduct of a company's business. Other employees cannot be held responsible. To be liable under Section 141(1), a person must fulfill both the legal and factual requirements of being responsible for the company's conduct and in charge of the business. If a person does not meet the legal requirement, they cannot be held liable. However, even officers who are not in charge of the business can be held liable under Section 141(2) if there are necessary averments in the complaint regarding their consent, connivance, or negligence. The court also provides a summary of the positions that can be held liable under Section 141.

In the present case, the court order states that the petitioners, who are the Chief Managing Director and Managing Director of the company, are responsible for the conduct of the business of the company according to the Companies Act. The court dismisses the petition as it lacks merit.

The court's ruling in this case is significant as it clarifies the legal requirements for holding individuals vicariously liable under Section 141 of the Companies Act. The court's interpretation of the law is in line with the principles of natural justice, as it ensures that only those individuals who are responsible for the conduct of the business are held liable.

The court's ruling also highlights the importance of complying with the India Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which regulates the manufacture, sale, and distribution of drugs in India. The Act lays down strict standards for the quality of drugs, and any violation of these standards can have serious consequences for the manufacturer.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's ruling in this case provides important guidance on the legal requirements for holding individuals vicariously liable under Section 141 of the Companies Act. The court's interpretation of the law ensures that only those individuals who are responsible for the conduct of the business are held liable, which is in line with the principles of natural justice. The ruling also highlights the importance of complying with the India Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which lays down strict standards for the quality of drugs.
