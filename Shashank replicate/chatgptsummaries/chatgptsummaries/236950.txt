The Indian Telephone Industry Ltd. filed a writ petition against an order of the Appellate Committee rejecting their appeal and holding that they are an industry covered by item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioner contended that their factory does not come within the Scheduled Industries mentioned in the Schedule of the Act. The court examined the definition of metallurgy and concluded that making telephone equipment cannot be called metallurgy. The court referred the matter to a larger bench to decide whether the petitioner's industry can be said to a metallurgical industry or comes otherwise within the purview of the Act.

The Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, is an Act of the Indian Parliament that provides for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities. The Act aims to prevent and control water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. The Act applies to all industries that consume water, except those that are specifically exempted by the government.

The Indian Telephone Industry Ltd. (ITI) is a public sector undertaking that manufactures telecommunications equipment. ITI filed a writ petition challenging an order of the Appellate Committee that held that they are an industry covered by item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Appellate Committee had rejected ITI's appeal against an order of the Pollution Control Board that had directed ITI to pay water cess for the period from 1981 to 1986.

ITI contended that their factory does not come within the Scheduled Industries mentioned in the Schedule of the Act. The Scheduled Industries are those industries that are specifically listed in the Schedule of the Act and are exempted from paying water cess. ITI argued that they are not a metallurgical industry and, therefore, not covered by the Act.

The court examined the definition of metallurgy and concluded that making telephone equipment cannot be called metallurgy. The court observed that metallurgy is the science and technology of extracting metals from their ores and refining them for use. The court held that ITI's factory does not fall within the definition of metallurgy and, therefore, cannot be said to be a metallurgical industry.

The court referred the matter to a larger bench to decide whether the petitioner's industry can be said to a metallurgical industry or comes otherwise within the purview of the Act. The court noted that the question of whether ITI's industry is covered by the Act is a matter of interpretation of the Act and requires a detailed examination of the provisions of the Act.

The court's decision has significant implications for industries that consume water but are not specifically listed in the Schedule of the Act. The decision clarifies that the definition of Scheduled Industries is not limited to the industries listed in the Schedule of the Act and that other industries may also be covered by the Act if they fall within the purview of the Act.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with their purpose and objectives. The purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, is to prevent and control water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. The court's decision ensures that the Act is interpreted in a manner that achieves its purpose and objectives.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of The Indian Telephone Industry Ltd. v. The State of Karnataka clarifies the scope of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and ensures that the Act is interpreted in a manner that achieves its purpose and objectives. The decision has significant implications for industries that consume water but are not specifically listed in the Schedule of the Act and underscores the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with their purpose and objectives.
