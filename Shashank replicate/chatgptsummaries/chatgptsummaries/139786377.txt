The Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalay Zoo in Indore has been the subject of a writ petition filed by Ankit Singh Parihar against the Forest Department. The petitioner has requested that the animals in captivity be provided with a natural habitat and appropriate arrangements be made for them, or they be released from the zoo. The respondent, the Forest Department, has argued that they are taking necessary steps to provide better habitats for the animals and that the petitioner has not exhausted all statutory remedies.

The court order pertains to this writ petition and has dismissed it without any order as to the cost. The court has not provided any reasons for the dismissal of the writ petition. However, it is important to note that the court has not made any observations on the merits of the case.

The petitioner's request for the animals to be provided with a natural habitat and appropriate arrangements to be made for them is a valid concern. The welfare of animals in captivity is a matter of great importance, and it is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that they are provided with the best possible care.

The respondent's argument that they are taking necessary steps to provide better habitats for the animals is also a valid point. It is important to note that the process of providing better habitats for animals is a gradual one and cannot be achieved overnight. The authorities need to take into account various factors such as the availability of resources, the suitability of the habitat, and the safety of the animals before making any changes.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition without any order as to the cost is a standard practice. The court may order the petitioner to pay the respondent's costs if it finds that the petition was frivolous or vexatious. However, in this case, the court has not found any such grounds to order the petitioner to pay the respondent's costs.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by Ankit Singh Parihar against the Forest Department regarding the captivity of wild animals in the Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalay Zoo in Indore has been dismissed without any order as to the cost. The court has not provided any reasons for the dismissal of the writ petition, and it is important to note that the court has not made any observations on the merits of the case. The welfare of animals in captivity is a matter of great importance, and it is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that they are provided with the best possible care. The authorities need to take into account various factors such as the availability of resources, the suitability of the habitat, and the safety of the animals before making any changes.
