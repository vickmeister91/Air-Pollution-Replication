The court case involving the construction of the high-rise building called "Manipal Centre" in Bangalore has been a long-standing dispute. The petitioner, Mrs. Ameena Moosa, had objected to the construction on the grounds that it was damaging her compound wall. Other writ petitioners had also opposed the construction, citing violations of building bye-laws and encroachment on public spaces. The case has gone through multiple appeals and inspections, with the Supreme Court directing the High Court to hear the appeals on their merits for final disposal.

The court found that there were violations of building regulations in the construction of the Manipal Centre. The violations included exceeding the permissible plot coverage area, violating the floor area ratio, non-uniform height of the basement floor, and mezzanine floors that did not accord with the floor area ratio. The parking space available was also less than required, and the basement was being used for commercial purposes without being air-conditioned.

The court dismissed some appeals and allowed others, but overall, the petitioners opposing the construction were found to have delayed legal action and failed to join necessary parties. The Karnataka State Pollution Board's appeal was also disposed of.
