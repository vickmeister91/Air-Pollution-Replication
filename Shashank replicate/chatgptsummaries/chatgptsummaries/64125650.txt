The Delhi High Court recently allowed certain industries engaged in the industrial activities of stainless steel pickling to be impleaded as co-petitioners in a writ petition challenging the Master Plan for Delhi - 2021. The court quashed a letter issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) requiring the closure of units engaged in stainless steel pickling. The court held that the period of three years available for relocation of such industries outside Delhi commenced only from 23.9.2013 when the plan was amended. The court directed the DPCC to decide the pending applications seeking its consent, including the applications which were earlier submitted to it and returned, as expeditiously as possible and in any case within the statutory time prescribed in this regard.

The case pertains to the industrial activities of stainless steel pickling, which involves the removal of impurities from the surface of stainless steel. The process generates acidic waste, which is hazardous to the environment. The DPCC had issued a letter in 2016 requiring the closure of units engaged in stainless steel pickling in Delhi, citing environmental concerns. The affected industries challenged the DPCC's decision in a writ petition before the Delhi High Court.

The court allowed the affected industries to be impleaded as co-petitioners in the writ petition challenging the Master Plan for Delhi - 2021. The Master Plan is a statutory document that outlines the development plan for Delhi. The affected industries argued that the Master Plan did not provide for the relocation of industries engaged in stainless steel pickling outside Delhi. They contended that the DPCC's decision to require the closure of their units was arbitrary and illegal.

The court held that the Master Plan did not provide for the relocation of industries engaged in stainless steel pickling outside Delhi. However, the court noted that the Master Plan had been amended in 2013 to provide for the relocation of hazardous industries outside Delhi. The court held that the period of three years available for relocation of such industries outside Delhi commenced only from 23.9.2013 when the plan was amended. The court held that the DPCC's decision to require the closure of units engaged in stainless steel pickling was premature and illegal.

The court quashed the DPCC's letter requiring the closure of units engaged in stainless steel pickling. The court directed the DPCC to decide the pending applications seeking its consent, including the applications which were earlier submitted to it and returned, as expeditiously as possible and in any case within the statutory time prescribed in this regard. The court noted that the affected industries had made several applications seeking the DPCC's consent for their operations, but the DPCC had not decided on these applications.

The court's decision is significant as it provides relief to industries engaged in stainless steel pickling in Delhi. The court's decision clarifies that the Master Plan does not provide for the relocation of industries engaged in stainless steel pickling outside Delhi. The court's decision also clarifies that the period of three years available for relocation of hazardous industries outside Delhi commenced only from 23.9.2013 when the plan was amended. The court's decision directs the DPCC to decide the pending applications seeking its consent, including the applications which were earlier submitted to it and returned, as expeditiously as possible and in any case within the statutory time prescribed in this regard.
