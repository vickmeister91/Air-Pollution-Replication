A court order was issued in a case filed by the Wild Life Institute against Abdul Gaffar and Srikant for violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The complaint alleged that Abdul Gaffar was found in possession of a cured leopard skin, which he had received from Srikant for sale. The court heard arguments on the point of charge and found sufficient material to frame charges against Abdul Gaffar under sections 44, 49B(1), and 51 of the Act. However, the court discharged Srikant from the case as there was no incriminating evidence against him except his disclosure, which was inadmissible.

The court directed the accused to inform in writing which witnesses they want to cross-examine. The court order allows the prosecution to examine additional witnesses on the next date of hearing, besides the four witnesses already mentioned. The order was announced in open court on February 26, 2011, in a case between Wild Life and Abdul Gaffar, with case number CC No. 62/1/09. The order was issued by ACMM/SPL.ACTS CENTRAL/DELHI.
