The first court order pertains to a case between ANI Technologies Private Limited and the Government of NCT of Delhi. ANI Technologies is a technology company that provides mobile application services for commercial vehicle owners to operate their vehicles for hire under the name and business model of "OLACABS". The Transport Department of GNCTD issued a public notice in 2014 prohibiting all transport/taxi service providers through web-based technology from providing such services to the public in NCTD, except for licensed providers. ANI Technologies challenged this order and filed a writ petition.

The Deputy Commissioner of Transport, GNCTD, passed an order in 2015 holding that ANI Technologies is a "taxi service provider" and that the vehicles being used by the company without complying with the directions of the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors. are not allowed to ply point-to-point taxi services in Delhi. ANI Technologies filed another writ petition seeking to quash this order, but the learned Single Judge declined to grant interim relief.

The court order discusses the contentions made by ANI Technologies and the decision of the learned Single Judge. ANI Technologies contended that the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Transport was arbitrary and illegal as it was passed without giving ANI Technologies an opportunity to be heard. ANI Technologies also contended that the order was passed without any basis or material on record to show that ANI Technologies was violating any law or rule.

The court observed that the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Transport was not a final order and that ANI Technologies had the remedy of filing an appeal against the order. The court also observed that the learned Single Judge had declined to grant interim relief to ANI Technologies as ANI Technologies had failed to make out a prima facie case in its favour.

The court further observed that the issue of whether ANI Technologies is a "taxi service provider" and whether the vehicles being used by the company are allowed to ply point-to-point taxi services in Delhi without complying with the directions of the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors. is a larger issue that requires further consideration. The court, therefore, directed the Deputy Commissioner of Transport to consider the matter afresh and pass a reasoned order after giving ANI Technologies an opportunity to be heard.

The second court order discusses a case involving a taxi company that was banned from operating in Delhi due to violations of the Motor Vehicles Act. The company was found to be using vehicles that did not comply with the requirements for intra-city taxis, and also violated orders banning the use of non-CNG run transport vehicles within Delhi.

The court found that the issue of whether the company's business activity falls under the Radio Taxi Scheme and is governed by the Motor Vehicles Act is a larger issue that requires further consideration. The court also upheld the ban on the company's use of diesel taxis and dismissed the appeal.

In conclusion, both court orders deal with cases involving taxi companies operating in Delhi. The first order pertains to a challenge by ANI Technologies against an order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Transport, GNCTD, holding that ANI Technologies is a "taxi service provider" and that the vehicles being used by the company without complying with the directions of the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors. are not allowed to ply point-to-point taxi services in Delhi. The second order deals with a taxi company that was banned from operating in Delhi due to violations of the Motor Vehicles Act. Both orders highlight the need for compliance with the law and regulations governing the operation of taxi services in Delhi.
