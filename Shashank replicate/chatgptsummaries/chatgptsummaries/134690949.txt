The case in question involves a complaint filed by the Forest Range Officer against Deepu and three others for committing offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Kerala Forest Act. The accused were caught transporting illicitly collected cinnamon bark from a wildlife sanctuary, and an auto rickshaw was seized in the process. Deepu filed a petition for interim custody of the auto rickshaw, which was granted by the Magistrate's Court. However, the Forest Range Officer challenged this order, arguing that the vehicle becomes the property of the Central Government under Section 39 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and cannot be released to any person.

The court ultimately set aside the order granting interim custody of the auto rickshaw and remanded the matter to the trial court for fresh consideration and disposal. This decision was based on the fact that the vehicle in question was seized in connection with an offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, which provides that any property seized in connection with such an offence becomes the property of the Central Government. As such, the court held that the Magistrate's Court did not have the authority to grant interim custody of the vehicle to Deepu or any other person.

The court's decision was based on a strict interpretation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and its provisions regarding the seizure and ownership of property connected to offences under the Act. The Act provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and includes provisions for the seizure and forfeiture of property used in connection with offences under the Act. In this case, the auto rickshaw was used to transport illicitly collected cinnamon bark from a wildlife sanctuary, and as such, it was subject to seizure and forfeiture under the Act.

The court's decision highlights the importance of strict adherence to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and other laws designed to protect wildlife and their habitats. It also underscores the need for individuals and businesses to be aware of the legal requirements and potential consequences of their actions when operating in or near protected areas.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the need for strict enforcement of laws designed to achieve this goal. It also highlights the potential consequences of violating these laws, including the seizure and forfeiture of property used in connection with such offences.
