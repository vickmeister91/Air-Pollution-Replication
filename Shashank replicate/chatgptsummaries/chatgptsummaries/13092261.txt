The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Sushila against the termination of her services as an Anganwadi worker. The petitioner claimed that no enquiry was conducted with her participation and the termination violated the procedure prescribed under the circular dated 10/07/2007. The State Government, in its reply, stated that the petitioner was habitual in remaining absent. 

The court found that the respondents violated the principles of natural justice and fair play as no procedure was followed, and no enquiry was conducted with the participation of the petitioner. The court explained the importance of natural justice and the audi alteram partem rule, which states that no one should be condemned unheard. The court also cited the Board of Education v. Rice case to emphasize the duty of administrative bodies to act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice, which include the rules of "nemo judex in causa sua" (no one shall be a judge in their own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). These principles are firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and the right to a fair hearing. The court emphasizes that not giving a hearing results in arbitrary decisions, which are contrary to the principles of natural justice and the Constitution. The court also notes that the concept of natural justice has evolved over time and that the rules may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute.

The court order states that equality and fairness are important principles under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The procedure established by law must be just and reasonable, and not arbitrary or oppressive. The court found that the respondents did not follow the prescribed procedure and therefore, the impugned order dated 24/08/2012 is quashed. The petitioner is to be reinstated in services and entitled to all consequential benefits except back wages/honorarium. The writ petition stands disposed of.
