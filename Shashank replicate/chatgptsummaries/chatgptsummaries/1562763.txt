Dr. C.S. Jayakumar, a wildlife expert, filed a writ petition against the appointment of the fifth respondent as Curator of the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo, claiming that he was not qualified for the position. The petitioner argued that the post of Curator required a Master's Degree in Wildlife/Science/Zoology, which the fifth respondent did not possess. The Kerala High Court heard the case and found that the Special Rules for the post in the Subordinate Service in the Department of Museums and Zoos needed to be amended to provide for the required qualifications for various posts.

The court observed that the post of Curator was a highly specialized one, and the person appointed to the post must have the necessary qualifications and experience to handle the responsibilities of the position. The court noted that the post of Curator required a Master's Degree in Wildlife/Science/Zoology, and the fifth respondent did not possess this qualification. The court also observed that the appointment of an unqualified person to the post of Curator would have serious consequences for the animals in the zoo and the visitors.

The court further noted that the Special Rules for the post in the Subordinate Service in the Department of Museums and Zoos did not provide for the required qualifications for various posts. The court observed that the absence of such qualifications would lead to the appointment of unqualified persons to important positions, which would have serious consequences for the functioning of the department.

The court, therefore, ordered appropriate action to be taken to amend the Special Rules without delay. The court directed the authorities to ensure that the required qualifications for various posts in the department were clearly specified in the Special Rules. The court also directed the authorities to ensure that the appointments to various posts in the department were made strictly in accordance with the Special Rules.

The court's order was a significant one, as it highlighted the importance of having qualified and experienced persons in important positions in the department. The court's order also emphasized the need for clear and specific qualifications for various posts in the department, which would ensure that only qualified persons were appointed to these positions.

The court's order was welcomed by wildlife experts and animal rights activists, who had been raising concerns about the functioning of the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo for some time. The court's order was seen as a step in the right direction towards ensuring the welfare of the animals in the zoo and the visitors.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's order in the case of Dr. C.S. Jayakumar v. State of Kerala was a significant one, as it highlighted the importance of having qualified and experienced persons in important positions in the department. The court's order also emphasized the need for clear and specific qualifications for various posts in the department, which would ensure that only qualified persons were appointed to these positions. The court's order was a step in the right direction towards ensuring the welfare of the animals in the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo and the visitors.
