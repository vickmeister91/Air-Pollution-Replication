The court order in question pertains to three revisions under Section 11 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act against an order of the Tribunal relating to the assessment years 1984-85, 1987-88, and 1988-89. The case involves a dealer who had established a new unit for manufacturing Dal and held an Eligibility Certificate under Section 4-A of the Act, which exempted Dal manufactured by the dealer from tax. However, the dealer issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to the purchasers of Dal, which led to the Assessing Authority initiating proceedings under Section 3-B.

The Tribunal allowed the dealer's second appeals and set aside the order passed under Section 3-B. However, the court held that the order of the Tribunal was erroneous, and the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) was false and wrong. Therefore, the order passed under Section 3-B was justified, and the revisions were allowed.

To understand the case better, it is essential to know the provisions of the U.P. Sales Tax Act. Section 4-A of the Act provides for an exemption from tax for certain goods manufactured in the state. The dealer in question had obtained an Eligibility Certificate under this section, which exempted Dal manufactured by the dealer from tax. However, the dealer issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to the purchasers of Dal, which indicated that the Dal was taxable.

Section 3-B of the Act deals with the liability of the dealer to pay tax. If a dealer fails to pay the tax due, the Assessing Authority can initiate proceedings under this section. In the present case, the Assessing Authority initiated proceedings under Section 3-B based on the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) by the dealer.

The Tribunal allowed the dealer's second appeals and set aside the order passed under Section 3-B. However, the court held that the order of the Tribunal was erroneous. The court observed that the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) was false and wrong. The court noted that the dealer had obtained an Eligibility Certificate under Section 4-A of the Act, which exempted Dal manufactured by the dealer from tax. Therefore, the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) was incorrect.

The court further observed that the dealer had deliberately issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to the purchasers of Dal, which indicated that the Dal was taxable. The court noted that the dealer had done so to avoid the scrutiny of the Assessing Authority. The court held that the order passed under Section 3-B was justified, and the revisions were allowed.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to three revisions under Section 11 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act against an order of the Tribunal relating to the assessment years 1984-85, 1987-88, and 1988-89. The case involves a dealer who had established a new unit for manufacturing Dal and held an Eligibility Certificate under Section 4-A of the Act, which exempted Dal manufactured by the dealer from tax. However, the dealer issued Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) to the purchasers of Dal, which led to the Assessing Authority initiating proceedings under Section 3-B. The Tribunal allowed the dealer's second appeals and set aside the order passed under Section 3-B. However, the court held that the order of the Tribunal was erroneous, and the declaration made in Form 3-C (2) and Form 3-C (5) was false and wrong. Therefore, the order passed under Section 3-B was justified, and the revisions were allowed.
