The case in question involves a claim for compensation made by the wife of a deceased worker who died while working as a sweeper in a limestone division. The claim was made against the employer and the insurer of the workers. The employer and insurer denied liability, stating that the worker died of natural causes and not due to any stress or strain caused by work. However, the Deputy Commissioner of Labour held that the death was caused by stress and strain experienced by the worker while doing his work and awarded compensation to the claimant.

The insurer appealed the decision, but the court found no discrepancy in the conclusions arrived at by the Deputy Commissioner of Labour and upheld the award of compensation. The court order confirms that the deceased sweeper died during the course of his work and that the appellant's claim that he died of natural causes was not proven.

The appellant had already deposited the compensation amount, which the claimant can withdraw with accrued interest after filing a Memo and identification by her counsel. The appeal was dismissed, and the order passed in W.C.No.61 of 2005 was confirmed. There were no costs, and connected miscellaneous petitions were closed.

This case highlights the importance of ensuring that workers are not subjected to undue stress and strain while performing their duties. It also underscores the need for employers and insurers to take responsibility for the safety and well-being of their employees. In this case, the court found that the worker's death was caused by stress and strain experienced while performing his duties, and therefore, the employer and insurer were held liable for compensation.

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of proper investigation and documentation in cases involving workplace injuries or deaths. The Deputy Commissioner of Labour's findings were based on a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding the worker's death, and the court found no reason to dispute these findings.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder that employers and insurers must take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees. Failure to do so can result in serious consequences, including legal liability and financial penalties. It is essential that employers and insurers prioritize the safety of their workers and take proactive measures to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities.
