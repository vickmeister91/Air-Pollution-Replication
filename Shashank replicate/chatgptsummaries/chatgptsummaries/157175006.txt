The Madras High Court recently heard a case filed by M/s.Roshan Commercial Traders against the State of Tamil Nadu regarding the taxation of Ayurvedic medicine and food supplements. The petitioner had imported Ayurvedic Bulk Reishi Gano Powder and Gano Celium Powder from Malaysia and had given them to other companies for filling capsules. The petitioner argued that the product was an Ayurvedic proprietary medicine and should be taxed at 4%, while the Assessing Officer had levied a higher tax rate. The court considered several questions of law related to the case.

The court admitted the case and heard arguments from both sides. The petitioner had obtained various licenses and certificates to support their claim that the product was an Ayurvedic proprietary medicine. The Assessing Officer had levied a higher tax rate on the product, arguing that it was not an Ayurvedic medicine or food supplement. The court examined the process and determined that it qualifies as manufacturing. The court also disputes the tribunal's finding that the product is not an Ayurvedic medicine and cites expert opinions and licenses obtained by the manufacturer to support their claim. The court ultimately concludes that the product is an Ayurvedic proprietary medicine and issues a direction accordingly.

The court order discusses a case involving the rate of tax levied by the Assessing Officer on a product sold through multi-level marketing. The Tribunal had classified the product as falling under the residuary deal due to it being an imported product, not an Ayurvedic medicine or food supplement, and not sold in medical shops. However, the court refers to a previous case involving the same product and concludes that it has undergone a process of manufacturing and is an Ayurvedic Proprietary Preparation. The petitioner had obtained various licenses and certificates to support this claim. The court extracts paragraphs from the previous judgement to support its conclusion.

The court order states that a product was found to be Ayurvedic Proprietary Medicines and should be taxed accordingly. The decision was made by the Kerala Sales Tax Tribunal and has been upheld. The method of marketing the product, through multi-level marketing, was deemed irrelevant in determining the rate of tax payable on the product. The order passed by the Tribunal was allowed and the Substantial Questions of Law were answered in favor of the appellant.

In summary, the court orders discussed cases related to the taxation of Ayurvedic medicine and food supplements. The court considered various questions of law related to the cases and heard arguments from both sides. In one case, the court determined that a product was an Ayurvedic proprietary medicine and should be taxed at a lower rate. In another case, the court referred to a previous judgement to conclude that a product was an Ayurvedic Proprietary Preparation and should be taxed accordingly. In a third case, the court upheld a decision made by the Kerala Sales Tax Tribunal that a product was an Ayurvedic Proprietary Medicine and should be taxed accordingly, regardless of the method of marketing. Overall, the court orders provide clarity on the taxation of Ayurvedic medicine and food supplements and ensure that they are taxed appropriately.
