The court order pertains to the sealing of premises in Delhi by the Monitoring Committee (MC) constituted by the Supreme Court. The court order limits the powers of the MC to seal premises and directs that no further sealing be done until the matter is heard by the court. The court also directs that no construction be made on premises under scrutiny and no order be passed to regularize such construction. The court further directs that applications for desealing of premises be treated as statutory appeals and transferred to the appropriate appellate tribunal for disposal. The court also imposes conditions on the desealing of premises and limits the benefit of the order to those using residential premises for commercial or non-residential purposes. The court order also clarifies that the MC's authorization is limited to residential premises being misused for industrial or commercial purposes and does not extend to the alleged misuse of industrial premises for commercial purposes.

The court order discusses a case where the Municipal Corporation (MC) and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) took action to seal a property being used for commercial purposes, despite a pending appeal and a previous judgment allowing the conversion of the property from industrial to commercial use. The court finds that the actions of the MC and NDMC were an overreach of the court's authority and unfair to the other party. The court also discusses previous Supreme Court judgments regarding the misuse of residential properties for commercial purposes and the authority of the Monitoring Committee.

The court order discusses the sealing of the FFC (Flatted Factory Complex) by the NDMC (New Delhi Municipal Council) on the directions of the MC (Monitoring Committee) without any prior notice or hearing to the occupants. The court examines whether the MC had the authority to direct the sealing of the FFC and concludes that the issue of whether the commercial use of the FFC is permissible under MPD-2021 is still under consideration. The court also notes that the NDMC did not claim any non-conforming use of the FFC when the writ petition was decided by the learned Single Judge.

The court found that the Municipal Corporation (MC) did not have the authority to issue an order to seal a commercial property without prior notice or hearing. The MC overstepped its authority and the action of sealing the property was deemed unjustified and illegal. The court ordered the property to be unsealed immediately.

The court order pertains to an application filed by DCM Limited seeking a stay on the sealing of their Flatted Factory Complex (FFC) premises in Bara Hindu Rao, Delhi-110006. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) had passed a sealing order on 11.01.2018, following a letter from the Monitoring Committee (MC) alleging misuse of the FFC for commercial purposes. However, DCM Limited argued that the matter was sub-judice and pending before the court, and any coercive action taken by NDMC on the premises till the disposal of the case would tantamount to contempt. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.
