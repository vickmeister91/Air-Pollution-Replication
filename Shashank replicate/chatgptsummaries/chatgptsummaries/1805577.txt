The Kerala High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a scheme to link Cochin's mainland with islands in the archipelago beyond the western backwaters. The scheme involves constructing bridges and reclaiming an area of 362 hectares in the Vembanad lake, with an estimated cost of around 328 crores of rupees. The court dismissed a writ appeal filed by the Institute of Social Welfare against the construction of bridges but opposed the proposed reclamation of the area.

The government of India had issued a notification prohibiting land reclamation in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), which includes backwaters influenced by tidal action. The court found that the proposed reclamation would not interfere with the natural flow of sea water and dismissed the writ appeal. However, the court ordered that the government of Kerala must obtain clearance from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) before proceeding with the reclamation.

The court order has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have expressed concern over the potential environmental impact of the proposed reclamation. The Vembanad lake is a vital ecosystem that supports a diverse range of flora and fauna, and any disturbance to its natural balance could have far-reaching consequences.

The court's decision to allow the construction of bridges has been seen as a positive step towards improving connectivity in the region. The islands in the archipelago beyond the western backwaters are currently accessible only by boat, which can be a time-consuming and expensive mode of transport. The proposed bridges would provide a much-needed link between the mainland and the islands, making it easier for people to access essential services and amenities.

However, the court's decision to allow the reclamation of an area in the Vembanad lake has raised concerns among environmentalists and local communities. The lake is a crucial source of livelihood for many fishermen and farmers in the region, and any disturbance to its delicate ecosystem could have severe consequences for their livelihoods. The court's decision to require clearance from the NGT before proceeding with the reclamation is seen as a positive step towards ensuring that the environmental impact of the project is carefully considered.

Overall, the court order pertaining to the scheme to link Cochin's mainland with islands in the archipelago beyond the western backwaters has been met with mixed reactions. While the decision to allow the construction of bridges has been welcomed, the proposed reclamation of an area in the Vembanad lake has raised concerns among environmentalists and local communities. The court's decision to require clearance from the NGT before proceeding with the reclamation is seen as a positive step towards ensuring that the environmental impact of the project is carefully considered.
