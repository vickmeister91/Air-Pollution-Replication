The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by industrial plants against the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The first petition was filed by M/s Jagatjit Industries Ltd seeking relief from an order passed by the Board, which directed the petitioner to comply with statutory requirements to reduce pollution levels. The Board had also directed the petitioner to reduce its production capacity to half of the permitted capacity and to upgrade its existing treatment system to achieve the prescribed levels within a period of two months. The petitioner sought a mandamus directing the respondent-Board to permit the petitioner to operate its industrial unit to its full capacity and to extend the time for filling up of two katcha Lagoons and submission of the scheme for rejuvenation of ground water by a further period of four months.

The second petition was filed by an industrial plant that manufactures potable liquor. The court order outlines several requirements for this plant, including limiting production to 35 KLD and submitting a bank guarantee that will be forfeited if production exceeds this limit. The plant must also upgrade its ETP to meet prescribed standards for effluent discharge, submit a scheme for rejuvenating groundwater, and install evaporation and incineration technology to achieve zero discharge. The order also extends the time frame for meeting these requirements and stipulates that the bank guarantee cannot be used for four weeks after encashment to allow the petitioner to seek redress.

In both cases, the court order seeks to balance the interests of the industrial plants with the need to protect the environment. The court recognizes that industrial activity is necessary for economic growth, but also acknowledges the harmful effects of pollution on public health and the environment. Therefore, the court has imposed certain conditions on the industrial plants to ensure that they operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.

For M/s Jagatjit Industries Ltd, the court has allowed the petitioner to operate its industrial unit to its full capacity, but has also required the petitioner to comply with statutory requirements to reduce pollution levels. The court has extended the time frame for filling up of two katcha Lagoons and submission of the scheme for rejuvenation of ground water by a further period of four months. This will give the petitioner more time to comply with the requirements and reduce pollution levels.

For the industrial plant that manufactures potable liquor, the court has imposed several conditions to ensure that the plant operates in an environmentally sustainable manner. The plant must limit production to 35 KLD and submit a bank guarantee that will be forfeited if production exceeds this limit. The plant must also upgrade its ETP to meet prescribed standards for effluent discharge, submit a scheme for rejuvenating groundwater, and install evaporation and incineration technology to achieve zero discharge. The court has extended the time frame for meeting these requirements and stipulated that the bank guarantee cannot be used for four weeks after encashment to allow the petitioner to seek redress. Failure to comply with these conditions will result in the plant being closed.

Overall, the court order seeks to balance the interests of industrial growth with the need to protect the environment. The court recognizes that industrial activity is necessary for economic growth, but also acknowledges the harmful effects of pollution on public health and the environment. Therefore, the court has imposed certain conditions on the industrial plants to ensure that they operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.
