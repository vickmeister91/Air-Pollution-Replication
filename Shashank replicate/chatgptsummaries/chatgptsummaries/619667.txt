The court order in question pertains to two execution appeals that deal with the same point. The appellant-decree-holders had obtained two decrees for possession of land and the recovery of sums of money from the Court of the Sub-Judge, Second Class, Sangrur. These decrees were passed on 10-5-1948. The question for decision was whether these execution applications should have been filed in the Court of the Sub Judge, Sangrur, or the Sub Judge, Sunam, was competent to entertain them.

The court examined Sections 37, 38, 39, and 150 of the Civil Procedure Code and concluded that both the Courts which passed the decree and the Court which has been invested with the territorial jurisdiction of the first Court are competent to entertain the application for execution and to execute the decree. The court allowed the appeals and directed that the execution applications be entertained by the Sunam Court.

Section 37 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with the place of institution of a suit. It states that every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try it. Section 38 deals with the place of suing in cases where immovable property forms the subject matter of the suit. It states that a suit for immovable property shall be instituted in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated. Section 39 deals with the place of suing in cases where the cause of action arises in a different place from where the property is situated. It states that a suit may be instituted in any Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction any portion of the property is situated, or where the cause of action arises.

Section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with the transfer of business. It states that where a Court has been invested with the jurisdiction to try suits of a particular nature or value, it shall also have jurisdiction to execute decrees passed in such suits. This means that the Court which passed the decree and the Court which has been invested with the territorial jurisdiction of the first Court are both competent to entertain the application for execution and to execute the decree.

In this case, the decrees were passed by the Court of the Sub-Judge, Second Class, Sangrur. However, the question was whether the execution applications should have been filed in the Court of the Sub Judge, Sangrur, or the Sub Judge, Sunam. The court examined the relevant sections of the Civil Procedure Code and concluded that both the Courts were competent to entertain the application for execution and to execute the decree.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of Courts in cases where there is a question of which Court is competent to entertain an application for execution. It also highlights the importance of understanding the relevant sections of the Civil Procedure Code in order to determine the correct jurisdiction of a Court.

Overall, the court order provides a clear and concise explanation of the relevant sections of the Civil Procedure Code and their application in this particular case. It serves as a useful reference for legal practitioners and highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdiction of Courts in cases involving the execution of decrees.
