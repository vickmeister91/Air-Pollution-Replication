The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the construction of roads and highways in India and the potential impact on natural water bodies and the environment. In each case, the court has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to explore the possibility of realigning the road to avoid or minimize disturbance to the tanks and to take measures to preserve natural water bodies for agriculture and the environment.

In the first court order, three writ petitions were filed by different parties regarding the proposed widening of National Highways Road No. 67 from Tiruchirappali via Karur. The conflict was between protection of the environment and preparation for development. The court directed the NHAI to form a committee of experts to explore the possibility of realigning the road so as to either completely avoid the road passing through the tanks in question or to minimize the disturbance to the tanks. The project, insofar as it passes through the tanks in question, shall be kept in abeyance until a new alignment is approved by the NHAI.

The second court order discusses a case where farmers challenged a notification by the Union of India regarding the construction of a road cutting across two lakes. The court directed the NHAI to form a committee of experts to explore the possibility of realigning the road to avoid or minimize disturbance to the tanks. The committee made recommendations for a slight deviation in the new alignment and suggested certain mitigations and measures for conservation of water resources. The Director of Water Resources at Anna University gave an opinion that the highway should not pass through the tanks and suggested alternatives. The committee agreed with the Director's views and recommended the NHAI to choose the alternative suggested by the Director or provide a road through the tanks over a bridge without disturbing the inflow and outflow, subject to certain conditions.

The third court order outlines directives for the NHAI regarding the construction of a road near Kallikudi and Punganur tanks. The NHAI is instructed to ensure that borrow pits for road formation are located 50m from the road alignment and limited to the depth of the deepest sill level of sluices. The bed level of hydraulic structures should be maintained to the invert level of the lowest sluice available in the tank to ensure proper inflow and outflow of water. The NHAI is also directed to provide adequate hydraulic structures in consultation with PWD to prevent interference with inflow and outflow. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving natural water bodies for agriculture and the environment, while acknowledging the importance of road infrastructure for transportation and economic growth. The court cites the principles of sustainable development, proportionality, and the precautionary principle in balancing these interests.

In the fourth court order, the NHAI was ordered to explore the possibility of laying a road while avoiding tanks or minimizing disturbance to them. A committee of experts was nominated to give their opinion, and they suggested three options. The court held that the opinion of the experts from the Center for Water Resources, Anna University, Chennai, should be given preference over the report submitted by the Committee of Experts nominated by the NHAI. The court rejected the argument that constructing over bridges across the tanks would be too costly and emphasized the need to protect the existing tanks and improve them.

The fifth court order emphasizes the importance of protecting water resources and maintaining a balance between environmental conservation and sustainable development. The court suggests that if it is inevitable to lay a road across tanks, it should be done by constructing over bridges to avoid dividing and rendering the tanks defunct. The court also notes that the Competent Authority to decide such issues is the Chairman of the National Highways Authority, and that environmental clearance was not obtained for the changed alignment proposed by the NHAI.

Finally, the sixth court order states that environmental clearance is required for the construction of new national highways and expansion of national highways greater than 30 km involving additional right of way and land acquisition. The NHAI cannot lay the road across the tanks without obtaining environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court allows the NHAI to adopt option A or B suggested by the Expert Committees, and if option C is adopted, it is necessary to construct over-bridges across the tanks in question. Environmental clearance should be obtained before adopting any of the options. The order also states that constructing culverts and minor bridges across the tanks will not be approved.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary all emphasize the importance of protecting natural water bodies and the environment while balancing the need for road infrastructure for transportation and economic growth. The NHAI is directed to explore the possibility of realigning roads to avoid or minimize disturbance to tanks and to take measures to preserve natural water bodies for agriculture and the environment. Environmental clearance is required before any construction can take place, and the court emphasizes the need to consider the opinions of experts in making decisions about road construction near natural water bodies.
