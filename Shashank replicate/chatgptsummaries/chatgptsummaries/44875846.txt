The case of Md. Shahjahan revolves around two letters issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) directing him to close his bakery until he obtains consent to establish and operate from the board. The petitioner filed a writ petition to quash these letters, citing that they were arbitrary and illegal. 

The High Court of Patna heard the case and directed the petitioner to file an appeal before the competent authority under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, within one month from the date of passing of the order. The court also directed the appellate authority to pass a final order within two months from the date of filing of the appeal. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the BSPCB had the power to issue such letters under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and the BSPCB is responsible for enforcing its provisions. 

The court also noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent to establish and operate his bakery, which was a violation of the act. The BSPCB had issued the letters to ensure that the petitioner complied with the act's provisions and did not cause harm to the environment or public health. 

The court's decision to direct the petitioner to file an appeal before the competent authority was in line with the act's provisions. Section 31 of the act provides for appeals against orders issued by the pollution control boards. The appellate authority is required to hear the appeal and pass a final order within a specified time frame. 

The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary consent before establishing and operating any industry or business that may have an impact on the environment or public health. The act provides for penalties for non-compliance, including fines and imprisonment. 

In conclusion, the case of Md. Shahjahan serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations. The court's decision to direct the petitioner to file an appeal before the competent authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was in line with the act's provisions and aimed to ensure that the petitioner complied with the law and did not cause harm to the environment or public health.
