The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Arun Kumar Poddar, who challenged the rejection of his application to convert a non-bailable warrant to a bailable warrant. The petitioner argued that the offences alleged against him were bailable and that the purpose of issuing bailable/non-bailable warrants during trial is to secure the presence of an accused who is not present on a particular day. The court agreed with the petitioner and quashed the order rejecting his application, directing the non-bailable warrant to be converted to a bailable warrant and for the accused petitioner to appear before the concerned Magistrate on a specified date.

The petitioner's argument was based on the fact that the offences alleged against him were bailable in nature. The court agreed with this argument and held that the purpose of issuing bailable/non-bailable warrants during trial is to secure the presence of an accused who is not present on a particular day. The court further held that the issuance of a non-bailable warrant in this case was not justified as the offences alleged against the petitioner were bailable in nature.

The court's decision to quash the order rejecting the petitioner's application and to convert the non-bailable warrant to a bailable warrant was based on the fact that the petitioner had a right to be released on bail as the offences alleged against him were bailable in nature. The court held that the petitioner's right to be released on bail could not be denied merely on the ground that a non-bailable warrant had been issued against him.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the issuance of bailable/non-bailable warrants during trial is to secure the presence of an accused who is not present on a particular day. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected during trial and that they are not denied bail merely on the ground that a non-bailable warrant has been issued against them.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the field of criminal law as it reaffirms the principle that the issuance of bailable/non-bailable warrants during trial is to secure the presence of an accused who is not present on a particular day. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected during trial and that they are not denied bail merely on the ground that a non-bailable warrant has been issued against them.
