The Supreme Court of India recently granted leave in two Special Leave Petitions and heard them together. The case involved a writ petition filed by Dr. Anahita Pandole challenging the permission granted to various advertising agencies for display of hoardings in breach of guidelines framed by the Municipal Corporation of Brihan Mumbai. The writ petition alleged that the hoardings caused environmental problems, damage to heritage buildings, and traffic hazards.

The Bombay High Court dismissed the Notices of Motion and directed that mobile hoarding vehicles should not be parked on main roads or carriageways and should not obstruct free flow of traffic. The State Government and the Corporation were directed to make appropriate regulations in consultation with appropriate bodies in relation to advertisement hoardings. The concerned police authorities and competent authorities were directed to take action against such vehicles. The Chief Secretary of the State of Maharashtra was directed to examine all cases and fix responsibility in all concerned departments and public authorities.

The court order directs the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra to examine cases related to the responsibility of concerned departments and public authorities. The state is also directed to frame a policy in consultation with other authorities regarding various facets examined by the court. All concerned authorities are required to ensure compliance with the order. The court dismisses certain notices of motion and does not award any costs.

The appellant argued that the initial contract granted to them was in 2003 and a fresh contract was granted in 2007. The appellant company had always acted upon the contract executed in their favor and had entered into third-party agreements for display of advertisement and mobile vans. The High Court had involved itself with other issues such as types of vehicles which could be used for the purpose of displaying mobile hoardings. The High Court had also relied on newspaper reports and photographs produced by the writ petitioner to bolster her case regarding obstruction.

The court order discusses a case involving mobile hoarding vehicles causing obstruction and traffic issues in Mumbai. The court found that the High Court had relied on erroneous newspaper reports and photographs to make presumptions about parking places allotted by the traffic police. The court also noted that all necessary permissions had been obtained by the appellant for the mobile hoarding vans. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation argued that granting licenses for such vehicles was part of its legitimate commercial activity and that restrictions could only be imposed on grounds of public interest. The court ultimately found that the High Court's judgment was based on conjecture rather than actual facts and set it aside.

The court order discusses a case involving the use of mobile hoarding vans for advertising in Mumbai. The respondent raised concerns about the height of the hoardings, which were not permitted under Motor Vehicles Rules. The court heard arguments from both sides, with the appellant arguing that the Motor Vehicles Department should have jurisdiction over the fabrication of the display vehicles. The State of Maharashtra argued that the Motor Vehicles Act provided sufficient powers to regulate traffic and ensure public safety. The court ultimately found that the issue of eligibility under the Motor Vehicles Act was not within its jurisdiction and that the authorities responsible for granting licenses had already deemed the hoarding vans safe for use. The court dismissed the writ petition and upheld the decision to allow the use of mobile hoarding vans for advertising.

The court order states that the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the Mumbai Traffic Police have no objection to the grant of licenses for Mobile Hoarding Vans, as they do not disrupt traffic flow or constitute a traffic hazard. The court also notes that care has been taken to ensure that the hoardings do not obstruct the cone of vision of motorists and that they are not parked near signals, turns, bottlenecks, or any other place that may interrupt the smooth flow of traffic. The court allows the appeal and sets aside the judgment of the High Court, but notes that the respondent No.1 may take up the issue of vehicle modification with the Motor Vehicles authorities. The parties shall bear their own costs in the appeal.
