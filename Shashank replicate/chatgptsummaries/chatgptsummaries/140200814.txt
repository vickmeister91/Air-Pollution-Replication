The court order pertains to a dispute over mining activities in a village in Maharashtra. The Grampanchayat Ambegaon Taluka Mulshi, District Pune, filed a writ petition requesting the court to quash and set aside the order passed by the Secretary and Officer on Special Duty (Appeals), Revenue and Forest Department, dated 24th December 2014, and to issue a direction to the respondents for quashment of the recommendation made by the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee in its 75th Meeting dated 14/15 March 2014. The petition relates to the grant of mining permission on 7th May 2010 in favour of Respondent No.5 for conducting mining activity in the private land bearing Gat Nos. 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505 and 510 situate at Village Bhilarewadi, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune.

The petitioner alleges that the respondent did not fulfill the conditions of the no objection granted by the village Panchayat and that their activities are causing harm to the environment. The Additional Collector ordered the cancellation of the mining lease granted to the respondent, which was challenged by the respondent in an appeal. The appeal was dismissed by the Additional Commissioner, but the respondent approached the State Government seeking a revision application. The Hon'ble Minister stayed the order passed by the Additional Collector.

The petitioner approached the court, which disposed of the case with a direction to the Hon'ble Minister to decide the revision application within two months. The court also noted that the respondent had not obtained the necessary environmental clearance certificate for conducting mining activities in an area exceeding 5 hectares. The State Government directed the Additional Collector to take further action concerning the quarry lease after the decision of the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee and State Environmental Impact Assessment Agency and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.

The court order also mentions the requirement of prior environmental clearance for mining activities as prescribed by a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court order discusses the requirement of prior environmental clearance for projects and activities falling under categories "A" and "B" based on their potential impact on human health and natural resources. The Regulatory Authority for granting environmental clearance is either the Central Government or the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The order also mentions the need for public consultation and the application of general conditions for projects falling under category "B" located within 10 km of protected areas, critically polluted areas, eco-sensitive areas, and inter-state or international boundaries.

The court finds that the mining lease granted without prior environmental clearance is impermissible and that the consent obtained from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board does not negate this requirement. The Respondent's defense is deemed unacceptable, and the court orders the Respondent to cease mining activities until obtaining the necessary clearance.

The court order discusses objections raised regarding the depletion of water levels and the availability of an alternate remedy under the National Green Tribunal Act. The respondent has restricted mining activities to certain survey numbers but the area being mined is still more than 5 hectares, requiring a public hearing and environmental clearance. The authorization issued by the Collector in 2010 did not accurately record the area of the Gat numbers, and the mining activities have caused environmental pollution and health issues for nearby villagers. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued a notice to the crusher operator to show cause as to why stone crushing should not be prohibited.

The court order states that the mining activity in a village has caused adverse environmental effects, including poor air quality and depletion of underground water levels. The State Government's decision to permit the mining activity has been quashed and set aside due to lack of consideration for these environmental factors. The order also addresses the issue of jurisdiction, stating that if a case involves both environmental issues falling under the National Green Tribunal's jurisdiction and issues requiring writ jurisdiction, the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 is not excluded.

The court order states that only cases falling under specific sections and Schedule-I need to be filed before the NGT. However, if a case involves environmental issues and other reliefs that are not covered under the NGT Act, a composite petition can be filed before the High Court. The court allowed a writ petition challenging an order passed by the State Government and quashed the order passed by the Secretary and Officer on Special Duty. The environmental clearance issued by the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority was rendered inconsequential and inoperative. The operation of the judgment was suspended for eight weeks to allow the respondent to avail of the remedy before the Supreme Court.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute over mining activities in a village in Maharashtra. The petitioner alleges that the respondent did not fulfill the conditions of the no objection granted by the village Panchayat and that their activities are causing harm to the environment. The court finds that the mining lease granted without prior environmental clearance is impermissible and that the consent obtained from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board does not negate this requirement. The court orders the Respondent to cease mining activities until obtaining the necessary clearance. The court also addresses the issue of jurisdiction, stating that if a case involves both environmental issues falling under the National Green Tribunal's jurisdiction and issues requiring writ jurisdiction, the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 is not excluded. The court allowed a writ petition challenging an order passed by the State Government and quashed the order passed by the Secretary and Officer on Special Duty.
