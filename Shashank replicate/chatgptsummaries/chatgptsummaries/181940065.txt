Salman, also known as Babul, was arrested for various offenses and subsequently filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The court granted him bail on the condition that he executes a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. Additionally, Salman must appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so until the completion of the trial.

The granting of bail is a common practice in the Indian legal system, and it is typically granted to individuals who are awaiting trial or sentencing. Bail is granted to ensure that the accused person appears in court for their trial and does not flee the jurisdiction. In Salman's case, the court deemed it appropriate to grant him bail, but with certain conditions.

The first condition of Salman's bail was that he must execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. A personal bond is a written promise by the accused person to appear in court on the specified dates and times. The sureties, on the other hand, are individuals who guarantee that the accused person will appear in court as required. The sureties must also provide a sum of money as security, which will be forfeited if the accused person fails to appear in court.

The second condition of Salman's bail was that he must appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so until the completion of the trial. This condition is standard for all individuals who are granted bail. It ensures that the accused person remains present throughout the trial and does not abscond.

The court's decision to grant Salman bail with conditions is a reflection of the Indian legal system's commitment to ensuring that justice is served. The conditions imposed on Salman are designed to ensure that he appears in court as required and does not flee the jurisdiction. The court's decision also reflects the principle of innocent until proven guilty, which is a cornerstone of the Indian legal system.

In conclusion, Salman, also known as Babul, was granted bail under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The court imposed certain conditions on his bail, including the execution of a personal bond and the requirement to appear in court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so until the completion of the trial. These conditions are designed to ensure that Salman appears in court as required and does not flee the jurisdiction. The court's decision reflects the Indian legal system's commitment to ensuring that justice is served and the principle of innocent until proven guilty.
