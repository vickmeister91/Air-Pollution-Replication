Tileshwar Sahu, the petitioner in this case, has filed a writ petition to quash a notification that removed him from his position as chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board before the end of his term. The reason given for his removal was that the pendency of criminal cases against him was affecting the image and functioning of the Board. The petitioner argues that his removal is political victimization and that the government has no arbitrary power to remove him before the end of his term without giving him a reasonable opportunity of hearing.

The case raises several important issues, including the interpretation of Sections 5 and 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the validity and legality of the order in light of an earlier order of the court, and the scope and extent of the power to reduce the term of office of a Member/Chairman. The case has been admitted for hearing.

The petitioner, Tileshwar Sahu, was appointed as the Chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board for a term of three years. However, before the end of his term, he was removed from his position by a notification issued by the government. The reason given for his removal was that the pendency of criminal cases against him was affecting the image and functioning of the Board. The petitioner argues that his removal is political victimization and that the government has no arbitrary power to remove him before the end of his term without giving him a reasonable opportunity of hearing.

The petitioner has filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court to quash the notification and reinstate him as the Chairman of the Board. The case raises several important issues, including the interpretation of Sections 5 and 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the validity and legality of the order in light of an earlier order of the court, and the scope and extent of the power to reduce the term of office of a Member/Chairman.

The petitioner argues that his removal is political victimization and that the government has no arbitrary power to remove him before the end of his term without giving him a reasonable opportunity of hearing. He contends that the government's action is in violation of the principles of natural justice and that he was not given a chance to present his case before the decision was taken.

The government, on the other hand, argues that the petitioner's removal was necessary to maintain the image and functioning of the Board. The pendency of criminal cases against the petitioner was affecting the Board's credibility and the government had to take action to protect the interests of the public.

The case also raises important questions about the interpretation of Sections 5 and 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Section 5 provides for the constitution of State Pollution Control Boards, while Section 6 deals with the appointment of Members and Chairmen of these Boards. The petitioner argues that the government's action is in violation of these provisions and that he was appointed for a fixed term of three years, which cannot be curtailed arbitrarily.

The case also raises questions about the validity and legality of the government's order in light of an earlier order of the court. The petitioner argues that the government's action is in violation of the earlier order, which had directed the government to maintain the status quo with regard to his appointment as Chairman of the Board.

Finally, the case raises questions about the scope and extent of the power to reduce the term of office of a Member/Chairman. The petitioner argues that the government has no arbitrary power to reduce his term of office without giving him a reasonable opportunity of hearing. He contends that the government's action is in violation of the principles of natural justice and that he was not given a chance to present his case before the decision was taken.

In conclusion, the case of Tileshwar Sahu raises several important issues related to the interpretation of Sections 5 and 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the validity and legality of the government's order, and the scope and extent of the power to reduce the term of office of a Member/Chairman. The case has been admitted for hearing and it remains to be seen how the court will rule on these issues.
