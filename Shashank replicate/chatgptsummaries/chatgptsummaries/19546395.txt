The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Mohammed Pareri and others against the State of Kerala and others. The petitioners provided exhibits including a copy of an order issued by the 4th respondent canceling the number issued to the apartment. The court delivered its decision on July 14, 2016. The court order pertains to multiple petitions filed regarding unauthorized constructions made by the first petitioner in two apartment complexes. The court cancels the numbering of the apartments in both buildings due to violations found during inspections and contamination of nearby well water. The owners/occupiers of the apartments challenge the cancellation of numbering, but the court upholds the cancellation. The ownership of the apartments is not disputed in this case.

The court order pertains to two apartment complexes, KGN Apartments and KBN Apartments, which are alleged to have violated building rules and caused pollution. The owners/occupiers of the apartments have contended that remedial measures have been taken and are willing for inspection by the Pollution Control Board. The court has directed the Panchayath to inspect the premises and verify the complaint of unauthorized construction, issue notice to the occupants/owners of the building, and issue specific communication showing the violation if any detected. The owners/occupiers would be entitled to approach the Government for regularisation of such violation if law permits it. The court has also directed the Pollution Control Board to inspect the respective properties and if any objectionable pollution is revealed, remedial measures shall be directed. The court has left open the contention of the petitioner in a suit said to have been filed for damages against the builder of one of the apartment complexes.

The court order is significant as it deals with the issue of unauthorized constructions and pollution caused by such constructions. The court has taken a strict view of such violations and has cancelled the numbering of the apartments in both buildings. The court has also directed the Panchayath to inspect the premises and verify the complaint of unauthorized construction, issue notice to the occupants/owners of the building, and issue specific communication showing the violation if any detected.
