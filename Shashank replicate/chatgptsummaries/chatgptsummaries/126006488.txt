The illegal transportation of sand has been a persistent problem in many parts of the country, with many individuals and groups engaging in this activity for personal gain. The government has taken several steps to curb this practice, including the imposition of fines and penalties, and the seizure of vehicles used for transportation. In this case, the court has seized a tractor and trolley used for illegal transportation of sand, and the registered owner of the vehicle has requested its release.

The petitioner has argued that the vehicle may be subjected to decay, rust, and damage if kept in the open for a long time, and has requested its release. The court has taken note of this argument and has directed that the vehicle be released to the petitioner subject to certain conditions. These conditions include the furnishing of a bank guarantee and personal bond, and not allowing the vehicle to be used for any anti-social activities.

The requirement of a bank guarantee and personal bond is a common practice in such cases, as it ensures that the petitioner is serious about complying with the conditions set by the court. The bank guarantee is a financial instrument that ensures that the petitioner will comply with the conditions set by the court, failing which the bank will be liable to pay the amount specified in the guarantee. The personal bond, on the other hand, is a legal document that binds the petitioner to comply with the conditions set by the court, failing which the petitioner will be liable to pay the amount specified in the bond.

The court has also directed that the vehicle not be used for any anti-social activities. This condition is important as it ensures that the vehicle is not used for any illegal activities in the future. The court has taken note of the fact that the vehicle was used for illegal transportation of sand, and has therefore imposed this condition to prevent any such activities in the future.

The order has been sent to the trial court for necessary compliance. This means that the trial court will ensure that the conditions set by the court are complied with by the petitioner. The trial court will also ensure that the vehicle is released to the petitioner in accordance with the conditions set by the court.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the seizure of a tractor and trolley for illegal transportation of sand has directed that the vehicle be released to the petitioner subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee and personal bond, and not allowing the vehicle to be used for any anti-social activities. The order has been sent to the trial court for necessary compliance.
