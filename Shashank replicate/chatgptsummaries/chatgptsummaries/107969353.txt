The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which were heard and decided by the court. The first case involved a writ petition filed by Mariamma Varghese against Kayamkulam Municipality and others. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to stop the operation of a mill until necessary licenses and consents were obtained. The court disposed of the petition, leaving open the liberty of the petitioner to file suitable objections to any license or consent application submitted by the party respondent. The court allowed the writ petition to this extent.

The second case involved a list of exhibits, including copies of a judgment, complaints, notices, replies, communications, appeals, and circulars, all related to a case before the court. The court order did not provide any details about the case or the exhibits, but it is clear that they were considered and reviewed by the court in making its decision.

In the first case, Mariamma Varghese had filed a writ petition seeking a mandamus order to stop the operation of a mill until necessary licenses and consents were obtained. The court disposed of the petition, but allowed the petitioner to file objections to any license or consent application submitted by the party respondent. This means that the petitioner can still challenge the operation of the mill if the necessary licenses and consents are not obtained.

The second case involved a list of exhibits that were related to a case before the court. The court order did not provide any details about the case or the exhibits, but it is clear that they were considered and reviewed by the court in making its decision. It is possible that the exhibits were related to the first case, but this cannot be confirmed without further information.

Overall, the court order provides limited information about the cases and the decisions made by the court. It is clear that the first case involved a writ petition seeking a mandamus order to stop the operation of a mill, and that the court disposed of the petition but allowed the petitioner to file objections to any license or consent application submitted by the party respondent. The second case involved a list of exhibits related to a case before the court, but no further information is provided.
