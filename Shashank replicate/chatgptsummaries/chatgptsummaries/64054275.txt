The case in question involves a petition filed by Ramsundar, son of Shri Guttiram, under Section 482Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.2, Badi, Dholpur. The order in question refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner, which were case property of FIR No.171/2018 registered at Police Station Kanchanpur, Dholpur, for various offenses.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley should not be allowed to remain parked in the police station as they would gather rust and become useless. The court, after considering the arguments put forth by the petitioner, allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions imposed by the court required the petitioner to keep the tractor and trolley intact, produce them when required by the trial court, and execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court was also empowered to impose any other conditions it deemed fit.

This decision by the court highlights the importance of ensuring that case property is not allowed to deteriorate while in police custody. The court recognized that the tractor and trolley were valuable assets that could be put to use by the petitioner, and that keeping them parked in the police station would serve no purpose.

By allowing the petitioner to take possession of the tractor and trolley, subject to certain conditions, the court has ensured that the assets are put to good use and are not allowed to deteriorate. This decision also serves as a reminder to law enforcement agencies to take proper care of case property and ensure that it is not allowed to deteriorate while in their custody.

Overall, this decision by the court is a positive step towards ensuring that case property is properly managed and that valuable assets are not allowed to go to waste. It is important for law enforcement agencies to take note of this decision and ensure that they are taking proper care of case property in their custody.
