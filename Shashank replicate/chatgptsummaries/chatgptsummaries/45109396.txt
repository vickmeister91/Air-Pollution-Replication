The Gujarat High Court recently upheld the acquittal of Satyam Industries and its officers in a case related to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the lower court's findings were not erroneous and referred to the mandatory procedure in Rule 27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The court dismissed the appeal and cancelled any bail bonds.

The case in question involved allegations that Satyam Industries and its officers had violated the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by discharging untreated effluent into a nearby river. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had filed a complaint against the company and its officers, and a trial court had acquitted them of all charges in 2015.

The GPCB had appealed the trial court's decision, arguing that the lower court had erred in its interpretation of the law and that the evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. However, the Gujarat High Court disagreed with the GPCB's arguments and upheld the acquittal.

In its judgment, the High Court noted that the trial court had followed the mandatory procedure laid down in Rule 27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. This rule requires that a sample of the effluent be taken in the presence of the accused and sent for analysis to a laboratory approved by the GPCB. The results of the analysis must be communicated to the accused within 10 days, and the accused must be given an opportunity to cross-examine the person who conducted the analysis.

The High Court found that the trial court had followed this procedure correctly and that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the effluent discharged by Satyam Industries was harmful to the environment or that it had caused any damage to the river or the surrounding area.

The court also rejected the GPCB's argument that the accused had failed to obtain the necessary consent from the GPCB before discharging the effluent. The court noted that the GPCB had not produced any evidence to show that the accused had not obtained the necessary consent, and that the accused had produced documents to show that they had applied for and obtained the necessary consent.

In light of these findings, the High Court dismissed the appeal and cancelled any bail bonds that had been furnished by the accused. The court's decision is a significant victory for Satyam Industries and its officers, who had been facing the prospect of a lengthy legal battle and possible imprisonment if the appeal had been successful.

The case also highlights the importance of following the correct procedures when enforcing environmental laws. The mandatory procedure laid down in Rule 27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 is designed to ensure that the accused are given a fair trial and that the evidence presented by the prosecution is reliable and admissible. Failure to follow these procedures can result in the acquittal of the accused, as was the case in this instance.
