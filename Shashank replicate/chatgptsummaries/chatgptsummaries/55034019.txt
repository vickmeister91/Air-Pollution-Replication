The Karnataka High Court recently heard a criminal petition filed by M/s. Puravankara Projects Ltd against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought to quash the complaint filed by the Board seeking prosecution for violating environmental laws. The Board alleged that the petitioner had started construction activities without obtaining necessary consent and clearance from the Board and the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The court considered the provisions of the Water Act and the Air Act and found that cognizance of any offence under those Acts can be taken only on a complaint made by the Board or by any authorized officer. The court noted that the complaint was signed by the Environmental Officer of the Board, but no material was produced to show that the Board had passed any resolution to lodge a complaint. Therefore, the court ordered further investigation into the matter.

The court order states that there was no proper authorization to file a complaint alleging offenses under the Water Act or Air Act against M/s. Puravankara Projects Ltd. The court also found that the construction project of a residential apartment complex by the petitioner did not fall under the definition of an industrial plant as defined under the Air Act.

The court directed the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/- for the offense under Section 15 of the Act. The court ordered the closure of the prosecution upon payment of the fine.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the provisions of the Water Act and the Air Act. The court found that the Board had not followed the proper procedures in filing the complaint against the petitioner. The court also found that the construction project did not fall under the definition of an industrial plant as defined under the Air Act.

The court's decision to order further investigation into the matter was based on the fact that no material was produced to show that the Board had passed any resolution to lodge a complaint. This indicates that the Board may not have followed the proper procedures in filing the complaint.

The court's decision to impose a fine on the petitioner was based on the fact that the petitioner had violated Section 15 of the Air Act. The court found that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary clearance from the Board and the Ministry of Environment and Forest before starting construction activities.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper procedures when filing complaints under environmental laws. It also emphasizes the need for individuals and companies to obtain the necessary clearances before starting any construction activities that may have an impact on the environment.
