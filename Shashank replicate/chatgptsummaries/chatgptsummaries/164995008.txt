The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Shree Consultants, a company involved in environmental consultancy and biomedical waste treatment and disposal. The company had established a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (CBWTF) in Mysore, which was authorized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to operate in four districts. However, the KSPCB later excluded one district without giving the company a hearing. The tribunal found that the KSPCB's actions were contrary to the Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, and regulations thereunder, and that the company had been operating under capacity. The tribunal allowed the appeal and directed the KSPCB to restore the authorization for the excluded district.

In another court order, the establishment of a second CBWTF in Mysore was discussed, along with the actions of the KSPCB in recommending it. The appellant's CBWTF is currently running under capacity, and there have been no complaints against it. The feasibility report submitted by the fifth respondent is inflated and exaggerated, and the recommendation for a second CBWTF appears to be for extraneous considerations. The appellant has disputed the feasibility report and approached the CPCB for support. The court finds that there is no basis for establishing a second CBWTF and that the appellant's CBWTF is carrying out its activities scientifically and to the satisfaction of one and all.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the establishment of a new common bio-medical waste treatment facility (CBWTF) in Mysore. The appellant, who operates the only CBWTF in the area, filed appeals against the issuance of a consent order to the 5th respondent to establish a new CBWTF. The court directed the respondent authorities to examine the complainant's concerns in light of the Bio-medical Waste (Maintenance and Handling) Rules, 1998, and guidelines, and submit a report. The appellant argued that the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) should be binding on the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), but the Appellate Authority dismissed the appeals, stating that the KSPCB had the power to grant consent for CBWTF under the E P Act, 1986, and that the guidelines were subject to Acts and Rules. The respondents argued that the appellant was abusing its position as the sole operator of CBWTF in the area and that there was an imminent need for a new facility due to increasing demand and complaints against the appellant's methods of waste disposal.

The court order discusses the authorization and consent given to the appellant to operate a facility and collect bio-medical waste from certain districts in Karnataka. The order also mentions the establishment of a common treatment facility by the 5th respondent and the appellant's objections to it. The court notes several shortfalls in the appellant's operations, including operational and transportation shortfalls, complaints from healthcare establishments, and improper disposal of waste. The court also mentions the appellant's failure to submit monthly reports and unreliable data. The court dismisses the appellant's objections and notes that there is no legal basis for the appellant's claims.

In another court order, the respondent/KSPCB was required to take action on an application for issuing consent for establishment. The appellant's case was based on fiction, and there were complaints regarding non-collection of bio-medical waste. The consent for establishment for the CBWTF was issued in accordance with sections 25 and 21 of the Water and Air Acts. The court dismisses the appeals filed by the appellant and confirms the impugned order passed by the 2nd respondent. The guidelines do not impose any prohibition or restriction on the setting up of a new CBWTF. The construction sought by the appellant would create an impermissible monopoly in favor of the applicant. The KSPCB has notified that the authorization and consents issued by the KSPCB so far are hereby amended without service area mentioned therein for all the common bio-medical waste treatment facilities in Karnataka.

The court order states that the appellant cannot argue for their freedom to do business without following the rules and guidelines set by the Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998. The KSPCB has the power to decide on the number of operators necessary for the job, and the appellant cannot claim monopoly. The court also states that creating more CBWTF would serve the object of the act and facilitate the creation of more and efficient waste handling facilities, which would lead to a cleaner environment. The court dismisses the appeals made by the appellant and confirms the judgment of the Appellate Authority. The court also mentions that the Lok Adhalat had directed the need for competition to improve efficiency and better service in waste disposal without creating vested interest at the ultimate cost of the public.

The court order states that the appellant's CBWTF was not lifting biomedical waste regularly from healthcare units in three districts, which violated the Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998. The Lok Adhalat had directed the KSPCB and Regional Commissioner to find a way to allow units to set up their plants. The non-lifting of biomedical waste regularly and complaints from healthcare facilities were taken into consideration for allowing a new CBWTF. The court also discusses the importance of proper management of biomedical waste and the necessary provisions of the EP Act, 1986.
