The case in question involves a petition filed by Banti S/O Shri Ramjilal B/C Jatav under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.3, Badi, Dholpur. The order in question refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of a case FIR No.26/2019, registered at Police Station Sarmathura, Dholpur, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29 and 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act and Sections 30, 31, 32, 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley should be released as they were not subject to confiscation proceedings and were gathering rust in the police station. The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner with certain conditions.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the tractor and trolley were not subject to confiscation proceedings. The court also noted that the tractor and trolley were gathering rust in the police station, which indicated that they were not being used for any purpose. The court therefore concluded that there was no reason to keep the tractor and trolley in custody and ordered their release to the petitioner.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley. The petitioner was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The petitioner was also required to produce the tractor and trolley before the trial court whenever required and to not dispose of them without the court's permission.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on the principle that property that is not subject to confiscation proceedings should not be kept in custody unnecessarily. The court's decision to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner was therefore in line with this principle. However, the court also recognized the need to impose certain conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley to ensure that they were not misused or disposed of without the court's permission.
