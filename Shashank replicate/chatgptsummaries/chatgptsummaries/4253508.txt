The case in question involves a petitioner who filed a 482 petition to quash an order passed by the ACJM No.1, Nimbahera, District Chittorgarh in Cr. Case NO.199/1996. The petitioner's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon certain documents was rejected by the trial court on the grounds that certified copies of the documents could be filed and that the trial had been pending since 1996. The petitioner sought to challenge this decision through the 482 petition.

However, the High Court ultimately dismissed the 482 petition, stating that no interference was called for in the impugned order. This decision was likely based on a number of factors, including the fact that the trial had been pending for a significant amount of time and that the petitioner had not provided sufficient justification for why the documents in question were necessary for the case.

It is worth noting that Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) allows a court to issue a summons for the production of any document or other thing that it considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court may also reject such an application if it deems that the production of the document or thing is unnecessary or that a certified copy would suffice.

In this case, it appears that the trial court rejected the petitioner's application under Section 91 on the grounds that certified copies of the documents could be filed instead. This decision was likely based on the fact that the trial had been pending for a significant amount of time and that the production of the original documents may have caused further delays.

The petitioner sought to challenge this decision through the 482 petition, which is a provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure that allows a High Court to exercise its inherent powers to quash an order passed by a lower court if it is found to be illegal or unjust. However, the High Court ultimately dismissed the petition, stating that no interference was called for in the impugned order.

It is unclear from the available information what specific documents the petitioner was seeking to summon, or why they were deemed necessary for the case. However, it is possible that the High Court found that the petitioner had not provided sufficient justification for why the documents were necessary, or that the production of the documents would have caused undue delay in the trial.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of providing sufficient justification when seeking to summon documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. It also underscores the fact that the courts may be hesitant to interfere with decisions made by lower courts, particularly in cases where the trial has been pending for a significant amount of time.
