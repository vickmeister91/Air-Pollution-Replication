In a recent court order, the legality of creating leasehold rights in certain properties in Nagarahole National Park was challenged by organizations working for the welfare of tribals and ecological balance. The leasehold rights were granted to a private company for running a wildlife resort, and the petitioners argued that this violated the Wild Life Protection Act and the Forest Conservation Act. The court examined the relevant provisions of both acts and held that no one can acquire any right in, on or over the land comprised within the limits of the area of a national park except by succession, testamentary or intestate. The court also held that no state government can assign by way of lease or otherwise any forest land or portion thereof to a person other than a governmental instrumentality except with the prior approval of the Central Government.

The court order clarified that the Forest Conservation Act applies to all forest lands, regardless of ownership or classification, and that the government cannot permit the use of such land without prior approval from the Central Government. The term "assigned by way of lease or otherwise" includes the assignment of rights through easements or licenses. The court found that the State Government had assigned a portion of forest land to a private company without seeking prior approval, which is prohibited under the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Forest Conservation Act.

The court rejected objections based on locus standi, mala fide, and latches, and ordered the private company to stop all activities on the forest land and hand over possession to the State Government. This decision is a significant victory for organizations working for the welfare of tribals and ecological balance in Nagarahole National Park. It reaffirms the importance of protecting national parks and forest lands from commercial exploitation and underscores the need for strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations.

The court's decision is also a reminder of the critical role played by public interest litigation in safeguarding the environment and protecting the rights of marginalized communities. Public interest litigation is a legal tool that allows individuals and organizations to bring cases to court on behalf of the public interest. It is an essential mechanism for holding governments and corporations accountable for their actions and ensuring that environmental laws and regulations are enforced.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a significant victory for environmental protection and the rights of marginalized communities. It underscores the importance of strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations and the critical role played by public interest litigation in safeguarding the environment and protecting the public interest. It is a reminder that we must continue to fight for the protection of our natural resources and the rights of those who depend on them.
