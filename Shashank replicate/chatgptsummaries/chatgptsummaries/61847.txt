The court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure to revise an order made by the Chief Judge of the Court of Small Causes, Madras, in a case related to the levy of betterment contribution by the Municipal Corporation. The petitioner contended that the increase in the value of their land was not due to the town planning scheme and hence, the Corporation was not entitled to levy betterment contribution. The Arbitrator had earlier ruled in favor of the petitioner, but the Appellate Authority reversed the decision, relying on a Full Bench decision of the court. However, the court held that the Appellate Authority had misunderstood the scope of the Full Bench decision and that the Arbitrator had to determine whether there had been an increase in the value of the property due to the scheme or not, without any presumption in favor of the Corporation.

The court order is related to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator in determining the liability of betterment contribution for a property. The arbitrator must consider evidence from both sides to determine if the increase in property value is due to the town-planning scheme. Once the arbitrator makes a decision, the property is liable for betterment contribution, and subsequent valuations cannot be challenged. The order clarifies that the statutory declaration only applies to subsequent valuations made by the Chairman, not the initial valuation made by the arbitrator. The Appellate Authority failed to exercise its jurisdiction in determining if the increase in property value was due to the town-planning scheme, and the matter is remanded for further consideration.
