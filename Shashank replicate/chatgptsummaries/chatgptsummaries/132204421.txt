In two separate court orders, the accused, Sudarshan, was acquitted of charges under the Wild Life Protection Act 1972 for possession and attempted sale of bison horns without a license. The prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, as the complainant was also the investigating officer, and seizure mahazar witnesses were not examined. The evidence of two prosecution witnesses was insufficient to establish the guilt of the accused.

In the first court order, the judge noted that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The complainant was also the investigating officer, which raised questions about the impartiality of the investigation. Additionally, the seizure mahazar witnesses were not examined, which meant that there was no independent verification of the seizure of the bison horns. The evidence of two prosecution witnesses was also insufficient to establish the guilt of the accused. As a result, Sudarshan was acquitted of the charges.

The bail bond of the accused and his surety bond were cancelled, and the seized bison horns were ordered to be confiscated to the government after the appeal period was over. This means that Sudarshan was released from custody, but the bison horns that were seized from him would be confiscated by the government.

In the second court order, the judge noted that the prosecution had failed to secure the presence of key witnesses and had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The seizure of the bison horns could not be proven as there were no punch witnesses present. Additionally, there was no evidence that the accused sold or obtained money from the public. Therefore, the allegations against the accused could not be accepted.

The judge's decision was based on the lack of evidence presented by the prosecution. The prosecution failed to secure the presence of key witnesses, which meant that there was no testimony to support their case. Additionally, there were no punch witnesses present during the seizure of the bison horns, which meant that there was no independent verification of the seizure. Finally, there was no evidence that the accused had sold or obtained money from the public, which meant that the allegations against him could not be accepted.

In both court orders, the judge emphasized the importance of proving a case beyond reasonable doubt. In criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. If the prosecution fails to meet this burden, the accused must be acquitted. In these cases, the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and as a result, Sudarshan was acquitted of the charges against him.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of a fair and impartial investigation, as well as the need for sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. While the accused may have been in possession of bison horns without a license, the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that he had committed a crime. As a result, Sudarshan was acquitted of the charges against him.
