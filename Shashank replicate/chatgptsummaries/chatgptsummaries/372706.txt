The court order pertains to a case where the question of whether land leased by the State of Chhattisgarh to Maruti Clean Coal and Power Limited for setting up a coal washery is a part of forest land or not. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to prevent large scale forest depletion and to protect forest resources. The court directed each state government to constitute an Expert Committee to identify areas which are 'forests', irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognized or classified under any law and irrespective of the ownership of the land of such forests. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) was appointed to examine the matter and submit a report. The CEC submitted three reports, the last of which concluded that the land allotted to Maruti is not forest land. The court also noted the bonafides of the applicant and the nexus between the applicant and Maruti's competitor.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether land leased to Maruti is forest land or not. The court examines the bonafides of the applicant, Deepak Agarwal, who filed the case in public interest. The court finds that Agarwal's claims of financial support from friends and relations are difficult to accept, and that the accounts of Bilaspur Environment Society show that it does not have a bank account. The court also notes that there is a dispute over the title of the land in question between the State Government and Maruti on one hand and M/s South East Collieries Limited (SECL) on the other. The court concludes that Agarwal's application is far from bona fide and is nothing but a name lender. Despite this, the court examines the three reports of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in detail.

The court order discusses the findings of three reports regarding a disputed land in Chhattisgarh. The second and third reports conclude that the land in question is not a forest land, and the court accepts these conclusions. The court also discusses the technology used in the reports, including GIS, GPS, and satellite imaging. The court dismisses the applications filed by Deepak Agarwal and orders him to pay Rs. 1,00,000/- in costs to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), which will be used for the preservation of forests in Chhattisgarh.
