The Bombay High Court received a public interest litigation from permanent residents of Kolhapur City, requesting immediate measures to eliminate the supply of polluted water to the citizens of Kolhapur and implementing a water supply scheme of supplying water from Kalammawadi Dam to the city of Kolhapur by closed pipeline. The court directed the respondents to take immediate action against the polluting industries and inspect the site near the Chemical factories, distilleries, sugar factories, and other institutions around the Kolhapur City. The court received reports from respondents, which consistently showed that the city of Kolhapur is being supplied potable water. The court found that two major concerns of the petitioners have been satisfied, namely direct supply of water by pipeline from Kalammawadi Dam and assured supply of potable drinking water to the city of Kolhapur.

The court order states that the petitioners' concerns regarding direct supply of water by pipeline and assured supply of potable drinking water to the city of Kolhapur have been satisfied. However, the court notes that it was unjustified for the Municipal Corporation to supply polluted drinking water and for the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board not to take appropriate action against industries discharging untreated effluents into the river. The court orders the third respondent to monitor the level of pollution in the river and ensure the supply of potable water to the city. The fifth respondent, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, is directed to keep a strict vigilance on the activities of industries discharging effluents in rivers. The court also orders the second and fourth respondents to accelerate the progress of the ongoing water supply project and complete it by December 31, 1999. The writ petition is disposed of with the above directions.
