The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over the establishment of stock yards near the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala, India. The petitioners in each case sought permission to store mineral products, such as building stones, in the area, while the Forest Department and other respondents argued that such activities could harm the environment and wildlife in the sanctuary.

In the first case, the petitioner filed a writ petition seeking to quash an order passed by the Deputy Forest Conservator and Wild Life Warden declining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the stock yard sought to be opened and maintained by the petitioner. The petitioner had entered into an agreement for storage of building granite stones and had submitted an affidavit undertaking that he is willing to indemnify the forest department against any losses and risk caused due to the storage of stones. The court found that the directions issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest had no application in the instant case and that the buffer zone of 10 Kms. had not been identified by the State of Kerala. The court also noted that the holder of a dealer's license would be able to store mineral products including minerals in any raw form such as rock aggregates, chips, rock dust, etc.

In the second case, the court order discusses a petition by a dealer seeking permission to store mineral products in a wildlife sanctuary. The court notes that the sanctuary is a protected area and storing such products could lead to pollution. The court also cites the Environment (Protection) Act and guidelines for declaring Eco-Sensitive Zones around protected areas. The Forest Department has rejected the NOC sought by the petitioner, and the court finds that the petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. The court ultimately denies the petition.

In the third case, the court order discusses a dispute over the establishment of a stock yard near the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The petitioner argues that the 1st respondent does not have the power to declare a buffer zone without proper notification under environmental laws. The respondent argues that even without a buffer zone, the Forest authorities have a duty to protect the flora and fauna and wildlife, and can decline NOC if the proposed activities can cause serious repercussions. The court considers both arguments and examines relevant judgments and laws before making a decision.

In all three cases, the court ultimately upholds the decision to deny permission for the activity. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife, and notes that the state has an obligation to do so under the Constitution of India. The court dismisses the writ petitions and denies permission for the establishment of stock yards near the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. While the petitioners in these cases sought to engage in activities that could generate revenue and create jobs, the court recognized the potential harm to the environment and wildlife in the area. By upholding the decision to deny permission for these activities, the court sends a message that protecting the environment and wildlife is a top priority, even in the face of economic pressures.
