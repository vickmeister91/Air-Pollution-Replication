The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to writ petitions filed against the authorities threatening to impound autorickshaws/three-wheelers unless they are fitted with CNG kits. The petitioners argued that the Supreme Court never directed compulsory conversion of autos or taxis to CNG single fuel mode. On the other hand, the respondents argued that the Supreme Court directed all TSRs to run on clean fuel, which includes CNG and LPG.

The petitioners had given undertakings in the Supreme Court to convert their autos to CNG single fuel mode, and the court cannot decide whether these undertakings stand discharged. The court disposed of the writ petitions with liberty to the petitioners to approach the Supreme Court for appropriate relief. Interim orders were passed to prevent the seizure of autos for three weeks unless respondents issue a direction regarding conversion to CNG single fuel mode in accordance with the law.

The issue at hand is the conversion of autorickshaws/three-wheelers to CNG single fuel mode. The petitioners argue that the Supreme Court never directed compulsory conversion to CNG single fuel mode. However, the respondents argue that the Supreme Court directed all TSRs to run on clean fuel, which includes CNG and LPG. The court had to decide whether the undertakings given by the petitioners in the Supreme Court stand discharged.

The court disposed of the writ petitions with liberty to the petitioners to approach the Supreme Court for appropriate relief. This means that the petitioners can approach the Supreme Court for further clarification on the issue. The court also passed interim orders to prevent the seizure of autos for three weeks unless respondents issue a direction regarding conversion to CNG single fuel mode in accordance with the law.

The issue of clean fuel is a contentious one in India. The government has been pushing for the use of clean fuel, including CNG and LPG, in order to reduce pollution levels. However, the conversion to clean fuel can be expensive for auto drivers, who may not be able to afford the cost of conversion. This has led to resistance from some auto drivers, who argue that the cost of conversion is too high.

The court order is significant because it clarifies the issue of compulsory conversion to CNG single fuel mode. The petitioners argued that the Supreme Court never directed compulsory conversion to CNG single fuel mode, and the court agreed with this argument. However, the court also noted that the Supreme Court directed all TSRs to run on clean fuel, which includes CNG and LPG. This means that auto drivers will have to convert to clean fuel, but they may have the option of choosing between CNG and LPG.

The court order also highlights the importance of undertakings given in court. The petitioners had given undertakings in the Supreme Court to convert their autos to CNG single fuel mode, and the court had to decide whether these undertakings stand discharged. The court did not make a decision on this issue, but it is clear that undertakings given in court are taken seriously and cannot be ignored.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's recent court order clarifies the issue of compulsory conversion to CNG single fuel mode for autorickshaws/three-wheelers. The court agreed with the petitioners that the Supreme Court never directed compulsory conversion to CNG single fuel mode, but noted that the Supreme Court directed all TSRs to run on clean fuel, which includes CNG and LPG. The court also highlighted the importance of undertakings given in court and passed interim orders to prevent the seizure of autos for three weeks unless respondents issue a direction regarding conversion to CNG single fuel mode in accordance with the law.
