The court order highlights the dangerous state of traffic in Delhi, with a high number of accidents and traffic violations. Despite previous court orders, there has been a lack of implementation and enforcement of traffic regulations. The use of black films on car windows is prohibited by law and poses a serious danger in the commission of crimes. The court orders a special committee to examine security concerns and issue permits for the use of black films. The use of red lights on cars is also restricted to government vehicles of high dignitaries. The court also prohibits the use of pressure horns and other devices that produce loud or alarming noise. Offenders will be fined in accordance with the law.

The court order directs the enforcement agencies to prevent the use of pressure horns and other offending horns on vehicles, as low fines are not a deterrent for traffic offenses. The court permits the state to recover the cost of installing cameras and other equipment for catching offenders as part of the composition fee. The court also directs the authorities to ensure proper lane driving, no overtaking in prohibited zones, and to fix bars in the middle lane to prevent sudden shifts. The court mandates that drivers of buses and commercial vehicles undergo training courses and refresher courses, and that drivers have a minimum educational qualification of 10+2. The court also directs that only a driver and a conductor should be in a bus and no person should be on the stairs or hang outside the door of a bus. The court permits the state to charge Rs. 500 as costs from every offender for each offense committed under the provisions of the Act and the Rules.

The court order includes various directions regarding traffic violations and safety measures in Delhi. The authorities are directed to take appropriate action against overloaded buses and drivers committing various offenses such as driving without a helmet, not driving in proper lanes, and using tinted glass. The government vehicles and buses are not exempt from fines for traffic offenses committed by their drivers. The buses in Delhi should be low floor buses with a bigger front screen to reduce accidents. The drivers must have a license and follow traffic regulations, and their working hours should be regulated. The drivers of buses must wear uniforms with name plates, and the bus stands should be disabled-friendly. The roads should be cleared from unauthorized occupation of shopkeepers, raidees, water-trolleys, and no part of the main road should be used for parking of vehicles. The hoardings and advertising boards near and facing the roads are traffic hazards and should be removed.

The court order directs civic authorities to remove hazardous hoardings and advertisements that obstruct traffic flow and distract drivers. The order also requires the implementation of road and traffic signs to facilitate safe traffic movement. The court rejects an application for modification of the order and reiterates that all hoardings on main roads in Delhi must be removed within one month. The order also establishes a committee to create a timetable for buses to prevent overcrowding at bus stands and requires drivers to wear uniforms and have a minimum education level. The court also imposes fines for traffic offenses and directs authorities to impound vehicles with impermissible materials. The order emphasizes the importance of preventing traffic offenses and enforcing traffic laws to ensure public safety.

The court order outlines various directions to improve traffic and transportation in Delhi. These include starting an educational program for drivers, closely monitoring their driving skills and behavior, ensuring buses are disabled-friendly and not overloaded, removing unauthorized occupation of bus stands and roads, prohibiting black films on car windows without permission, and impounding vehicles using pressure horns or impermissible materials. The order also establishes committees to oversee the implementation of these directions and mandates the issuance of circulars containing the directions within two weeks. The enforcement of these directions is expected to begin on April 9, 2007.

In summary, the court orders aim to improve traffic safety in Delhi by enforcing traffic regulations and imposing fines on offenders. The use of black films on car windows and pressure horns is prohibited, and the use of red lights is restricted to government vehicles. The court also mandates training courses for drivers of buses and commercial vehicles, and requires them to wear uniforms with name plates. The order directs authorities to remove hazardous hoardings and advertisements, implement road and traffic signs, and impound vehicles with impermissible materials. The enforcement of these directions is expected to begin on April 9, 2007.
