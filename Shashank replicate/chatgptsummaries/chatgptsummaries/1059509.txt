In a recent court order, Rayees Ahmad, who was accused of possessing a tiger skin, was granted bail. The court based its decision on two key factors. Firstly, there was no evidence to suggest that Ahmad had killed the tiger himself. Secondly, the maximum sentence for the offense was three years, which the court deemed to be a relatively minor offense.

The court also took into account the fact that there was no reason to believe that Ahmad would tamper with witnesses or abscond if released on bail. This was likely due to the fact that Ahmad had no prior criminal record and had cooperated fully with the authorities during the investigation.

As a condition of his bail, Ahmad was ordered to furnish a personal bond and two sureties to the satisfaction of the court. This is a common requirement in bail orders, as it ensures that the accused will appear in court when required and will not flee the jurisdiction.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Ahmad was based on a careful consideration of the evidence and the circumstances of the case. While the offense of possessing a tiger skin is a serious one, the court determined that Ahmad was not a flight risk and was unlikely to interfere with the judicial process. As such, the court felt that bail was an appropriate course of action in this case.
