The case in question revolves around a dispute over the jurisdiction of a Second Class Subordinate Judge to sell a property in execution of a decree. The respondents filed an application to set aside the sale on the grounds of jurisdiction, material irregularities, and benami purchase. The lower courts rejected the latter two grounds but agreed with the respondents on the jurisdiction issue, setting aside the sale. The appellants argued that the decree did not show on its face that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the executing court and that the respondents had waived their objection by waiting until after the sale. However, the court held that the executing court's jurisdiction must be based on its capacity to try the suit itself and that there was no waiver or acquiescence in this case. The court also rejected the argument that the appeal should have been made to the High Court instead of the District Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs.
