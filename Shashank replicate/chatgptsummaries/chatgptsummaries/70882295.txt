The recent court order pertains to the requirement of obtaining environmental clearance for mining activities under a notification issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court heard arguments on whether environmental clearance was necessary for mining activities on land less than 5 hectares and whether it was necessary in the specific case before them. The court concluded that environmental clearance is necessary for mining activities on land over 5 hectares and that in the specific case before them, there was no violation of the notification. The court directed that in case an area equal to or more than 5 hectares is available for mining of minerals, environmental clearance cannot be avoided even if the lease or permit is for an area less than 5 hectares.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the requirement of environmental clearance for mining activities and sets a threshold of 5 hectares for the same. The court's decision is in line with the principle of sustainable development and the need to protect the environment from the adverse impacts of mining activities. The court's direction that environmental clearance cannot be avoided even if the lease or permit is for an area less than 5 hectares is a welcome move as it ensures that mining activities are subject to environmental scrutiny irrespective of the size of the area.

The court's decision is also important as it provides clarity on the interpretation of the notification issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The notification requires that mining activities in areas over 5 hectares should obtain environmental clearance. However, there was ambiguity on whether this requirement applied to areas less than 5 hectares as well. The court's decision clarifies that environmental clearance is necessary for mining activities on land over 5 hectares and that in case an area equal to or more than 5 hectares is available for mining of minerals, environmental clearance cannot be avoided even if the lease or permit is for an area less than 5 hectares.

The court's decision is likely to have an impact on the mining industry as it will require mining companies to obtain environmental clearance for mining activities on land over 5 hectares. This may lead to delays in obtaining clearances and may increase the cost of mining activities. However, the court's decision is necessary to ensure that mining activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner and do not cause harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the recent court order clarifies the requirement of environmental clearance for mining activities and sets a threshold of 5 hectares for the same. The court's decision is in line with the principle of sustainable development and the need to protect the environment from the adverse impacts of mining activities. The court's direction that environmental clearance cannot be avoided even if the lease or permit is for an area less than 5 hectares is a welcome move as it ensures that mining activities are subject to environmental scrutiny irrespective of the size of the area. The court's decision is likely to have an impact on the mining industry as it will require mining companies to obtain environmental clearance for mining activities on land over 5 hectares.
