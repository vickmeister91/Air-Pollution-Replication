The court order in question pertains to an application filed by the applicants under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The applicants had sought to recall a prosecution witness for cross-examination, but the court found no grounds for recalling the witness. However, the court allowed the applicants' application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for copies of statements recorded during a merg enquiry, which are necessary for the defense. The court directed that the copies be supplied to the applicants' counsel, but no prosecution witnesses who have already been examined would be recalled for the purpose of confronting them with the copies.

The case in question was being heard by the 10th Additional Sessions Judge in Ujjain. The applicants had filed an application seeking to recall a prosecution witness for cross-examination. However, the court found no grounds for recalling the witness and rejected the application. The applicants then filed another application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking copies of statements recorded during a merg enquiry. The court allowed this application and directed that the copies be supplied to the applicants' counsel.

The court's decision to allow the applicants' application for copies of statements recorded during a merg enquiry was based on the fact that these statements were necessary for the defense. The court recognized that the defense has a right to access all relevant evidence in order to prepare their case. The court also recognized that the prosecution has a duty to disclose all relevant evidence to the defense.

However, the court also made it clear that no prosecution witnesses who have already been examined would be recalled for the purpose of confronting them with the copies. This decision was based on the fact that the prosecution witnesses had already been examined and cross-examined, and recalling them for the purpose of confronting them with the copies would be unfair to them. The court recognized that the prosecution witnesses have a right to be protected from harassment and inconvenience.

In conclusion, the court order in question allowed the applicants' application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for copies of statements recorded during a merg enquiry, which are necessary for the defense. The court recognized the defense's right to access all relevant evidence and the prosecution's duty to disclose all relevant evidence. However, the court also recognized the prosecution witnesses' right to be protected from harassment and inconvenience and therefore, no prosecution witnesses who have already been examined would be recalled for the purpose of confronting them with the copies.
