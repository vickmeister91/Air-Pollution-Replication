The court order pertains to a case where the legal representatives of the original petitioner, Ridhkaran, are challenging a judgment passed by the Board of Revenue and a learned Single Judge. The issues raised in the appeal are whether Ridhkaran's three sons should be treated as separate units or members of his family for the purpose of calculating the extent of land for the purpose of ceiling, and whether the gift of land made by Ridhkaran in favor of his son, Jagdish, in 1970 is valid or not.

The court discusses the relevant provisions of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, and the Rajasthan Tenancy (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) (Government) Rules, 1963. The court also examines the factual matrix of the case and the contentions raised by both parties. Ultimately, the court hears arguments from both sides and reserves judgment.

The court order discusses a case related to the ceiling area applicable to land holdings in Rajasthan. The court order explains various sections of the Act and Rules related to the maximum land that can be held, restrictions on future acquisitions, and recognition of certain transfers. The crux of the case is that the land in question was claimed to be ancestral property belonging to a joint Hindu family, but the court found the story of partition to be untenable and the veracity of the declaration to be questionable. The court also found that the transfer of land in question was not valid under Section 30 DD of the Act. Therefore, the court upheld the decision of the Board of Revenue and the learned Single Judge.

The court order states that a gift deed dated 20-5-70 and registered on 30-5-70 is not a valid transfer according to Section 30 DD as it was registered after the cut-off date of 31-12-1969. The court dismissed the appeal and there will be no order as to costs.
