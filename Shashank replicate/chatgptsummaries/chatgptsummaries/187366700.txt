In a PIL filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad, the destruction of the tropical rainforest in the Gudalur and Nilgiri areas was challenged in violation of various forest conservation acts. The petitioner highlighted the collusion between the respondents and vested interests in allowing trespassers to encroach upon forest land for felling trees and conversion of forest land into plantations. The petitioner also pointed out the adverse effects of such destruction on the environment, eco-system, and the quality of life of people living in and around the forests. The court order disposes of various I.As. and lists the prayers made in the writ petition.

The court order directs respondents to stop converting forest lands to plantations or other purposes, remove illegal occupants of forest land, stop transport and removal of timber from forests, and appoint a committee to assess damage caused to forests in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. The court has been monitoring the enforcement of protected measures for the protection and improvement of the environment and has directed the Ministry of Environment and Forest to formulate a scheme for compensatory afforestation. The court also recommends the creation of a Compensatory Afforestation Fund and the transfer of unspent funds to the fund. The court order includes several other recommendations for the protection and conservation of forests and wildlife.

The court order discusses the creation of a Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to undertake protection and conservation activities in protected areas. The order also outlines the powers and functions of the governing and executive bodies of CAMPA, as well as the management and disbursement of funds. The court emphasizes the duty of the state to preserve natural resources and the Doctrine of Public Trust. The court also sets rates for the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for non-forestry uses of forest land and exempts certain uses from payment. The court orders the transfer of all monies recovered on behalf of CAMPA to a bank account to be operated by an Ad-hoc body until CAMPA becomes operational.

The court order transfers funds from various officials of the State Government to a bank account operated by the Ad-hoc CAMPA, which is responsible for managing funds for preservation of natural forests, wildlife management, and infrastructure development. The auditors appointed by the CAG will examine whether proper financial procedures have been followed in investing the funds. The State CAMPA has been set up for each State/Union Territory with a three-tier structure responsible for the Annual Plan of Operation (APO) for various works planned to be undertaken during each year. The relief claimed in the applications is to direct the Ad-hoc CAMPA to release a minimum of 10% of the principal amount deposited by the States/UTs with Ad-hoc CAMPA and the total amount accrued as interest on such deposits to the respective State/UTâ€™s including to the State of Gujarat without the ceiling of Rs.1,000 crore.

The court order discusses the release of insufficient CAMPA funds, resulting in a shortfall in forest and wildlife conservation. The State of Gujarat and other applicant states have requested an increase in the annual release of funds, and the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) has recommended that the Ad-hoc CAMPA release 10% of the principal amount to each state/union territory from the interest received/receivable. The release of funds is subject to certain conditions, and the National CAMPA Advisory Council will issue guidelines on permissible activities. The court accepts the CEC's recommendations and modifies one direction. No money can be transferred or utilized without the court's leave, and the National CAMPA Advisory Council must file a status report on the monitoring and evaluation of the works being undertaken. The interlocutory applications are disposed of with the given directions.

The court order was issued on March 12, 2014, by three judges named Patnaik, Surinder Singh Nijjar, and Fakkir Mohamed Ibrahim Kalifulla. The order refers to a previous case from 1997 (1) SCC 388. 

In summary, the court order pertains to a PIL filed by T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad challenging the destruction of the tropical rainforest in the Gudalur and Nilgiri areas. The court directs respondents to stop converting forest lands to plantations or other purposes, remove illegal occupants of forest land, stop transport and removal of timber from forests, and appoint a committee to assess damage caused to forests in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala.
