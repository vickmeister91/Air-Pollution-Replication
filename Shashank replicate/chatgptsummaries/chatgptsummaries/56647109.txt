In a recent court order, Satish Handa was granted regular bail in a case registered against him under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner had been in custody since January 2019 and the trial was expected to take a considerable amount of time to conclude. The court allowed the petition and ordered the release of the petitioner on bail, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The case against Satish Handa was registered under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, which is a stringent law aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The case against Handa was related to the alleged illegal trade in wildlife and their products.

Handa had been in custody since January 2019, and his trial was expected to take a considerable amount of time to conclude. In such cases, it is not uncommon for the accused to seek bail, as they may have to spend a long time in custody before the trial is completed. Handa had filed a petition seeking regular bail, which was heard by the court.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and ordered the release of Handa on bail. The court, however, imposed certain conditions on the bail, which Handa would have to satisfy before he could be released. The conditions included the submission of a personal bond and surety bond, as well as the surrender of his passport.

The court's decision to grant bail to Handa was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that Handa had been in custody for a considerable amount of time, and his trial was expected to take even longer. Secondly, the court observed that Handa had no previous criminal record, and there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or a danger to society. Finally, the court took into account the fact that Handa had cooperated with the investigation and had not tampered with any evidence.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to Satish Handa in a case registered against him under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act is a significant development in the case. The court's decision to grant bail was based on several factors, including the length of time Handa had already spent in custody, his lack of a criminal record, and his cooperation with the investigation. The conditions imposed by the court on the bail would have to be satisfied before Handa could be released.
