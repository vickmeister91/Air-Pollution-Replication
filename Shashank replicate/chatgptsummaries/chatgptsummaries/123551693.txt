The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving the dismissal of an employee, Sagar Thomas, by the Federal Bank Ltd. for exceeding his authority in granting loans and advances. Thomas challenged his dismissal in the High Court, and the bank argued that it was a private bank and not a state agency, so a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable against it. However, the High Court found that the bank performed a public duty and was amenable to writ jurisdiction. The bank appealed, arguing that it was a private limited company and not a state agency.

The court examined whether the bank fell within the definition of "State" in Article 12 of the Constitution and referred to several tests to determine whether a body is financially, functionally, and administratively dominated by or under the control of the government. The court ultimately held that the bank was not a state agency and that a writ petition was not maintainable against it. The court order discusses the applicability of a previous case involving the U.P. State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. to the current case. The court examines the level of control and involvement of the state in the bank and its employees, ultimately concluding that the previous case is not applicable.

The order also references several legal principles regarding the control and public duty of corporations and agencies, including the ability of private bodies to be subject to writ jurisdiction if they perform a public duty. The court discusses the circumstances under which a writ of mandamus can be issued, stating that if a private body is discharging a public duty or has a positive obligation of a public nature, a writ can be issued. The order also refers to various Acts and provisions that demonstrate the deep and pervasive statutory control exercised by the Reserve Bank of India over scheduled banks.

The court concludes that scheduled banks discharge functions of a public nature and owe statutory responsibilities, and therefore, there is an element of public law involved in their activities. The court order discusses the powers of the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government over banking companies. The Reserve Bank can appoint a suitable person to replace a removed officer, and the Central Government can acquire undertakings of banking companies. The court compares the control exercised over banking companies to that over other companies under the Companies Act and the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act.

The court concludes that while banking companies are private enterprises, they have a significant impact on the economy and must be regulated to maintain financial equilibrium. The court also discusses the limitations of the government's control over private companies, specifically in the banking industry. While guidelines are provided by the Reserve Bank to ensure fiscal discipline, private companies are not subject to participatory dominance or control by the government. However, private companies may be subject to writ jurisdiction if they violate statutory provisions, such as the Industrial Disputes Act or environmental protection laws.

The court ultimately concludes that private companies carrying on commercial activity, such as banking, cannot be considered institutions carrying out statutory or public duties and are not subject to writ jurisdiction unless they have a statutory obligation or obligation of public nature. The court allows the appeal and holds that the writ petition is not maintainable. In summary, the court order discusses the applicability of writ jurisdiction to private banks and concludes that private companies carrying on commercial activity, such as banking, are not subject to writ jurisdiction unless they have a statutory obligation or obligation of public nature.
