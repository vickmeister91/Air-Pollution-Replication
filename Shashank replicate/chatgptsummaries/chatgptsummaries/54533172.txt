The issue of illegal sand quarrying in Tamil Nadu has been a matter of concern for the courts for some time. In one court order, a petition was filed under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 to punish respondents 1 to 4 for willful disobedience of orders of the court to stop illicit, illegal and unauthorized quarrying of sand and savudu from the river-bed and river bank of Kusasthalai River and the adjacent patta lands in Jagannathapuram and Inam Agaram villages, Ponneri Taluk, Tiruvallur District. The court appointed an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the area and file a report, which showed that there had been continuous indiscriminate quarrying of sand between his first inspection on 29-1-2000 and the current inspection on 6.4.20002. The Advocate General was requested to peruse the records and express his view in the matter.

In another court order, the issue of illegal sand quarrying was discussed in the context of its adverse effects on the environment, including damage to river beds, depletion of groundwater, and destruction of ecosystems. The court ordered the government to form a high-level committee to survey the situation and propose remedial steps within six months. In the meantime, the court imposed a ban on sand quarrying near bridges and mandated strict enforcement of regulations, including prosecution of violators and compensation for damages. The court also called for the formation of a special river protection force to police the areas and prevent illegal quarrying.

In yet another court order, the court called for the launch of a code to penalize theft and damage to public property, with heavy compensation to be paid by the culprits. A special river protection force should be mobilized to patrol and police river areas and seize vehicles involved in illicit quarrying and sand transport. District courts should be empowered to entertain complaints of sand mining and suspend operations if necessary. The petitioner was commended for bringing attention to the issue and was awarded reimbursement for expenses incurred. The Advocate Commissioner was also awarded additional remuneration. The Advocate General and Special Government Pleader were appreciated for their assistance in addressing the situation.
