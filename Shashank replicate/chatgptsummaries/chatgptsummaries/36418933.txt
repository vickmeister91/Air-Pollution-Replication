The Bombay High Court has issued a series of orders in a case involving M/s. Kale Entertainment and Resorts Pvt. Ltd. and Vanashakti Public Trust against the Union of India and others. The case pertains to the destruction and reclamation of wetlands in Maharashtra, and the court has taken a strong stance in favor of protecting these vital ecosystems.

In its first order, the court referred to a National Wetland Atlas for Maharashtra prepared by the Space Application Centre and Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre. This atlas identified 46,460 wetlands in the state, and the court ordered a ban on the destruction and reclamation of wetlands identified in the atlas. The court also directed the Secretary of the Department of Environment and the Secretary of Forest Department to decide whether to adopt the atlas or prepare their own document.

In addition, the court directed the Secretary of the Urban Development Department to issue a circular informing all corporations and the Zilha Parishad of the court's direction. This is an important step in ensuring that all relevant parties are aware of the court's orders and can take appropriate action to comply with them.

However, the court expressed displeasure at the lack of compliance with its previous orders and directed the State Government to prepare brief documents on wetlands within four weeks. The Principal Secretary (Environment) has been summoned to appear before the court to explain the lack of compliance by Divisional Commissioners and District Collectors.

In a subsequent order, the court directed all Collectors and Divisional Commissioners to prepare and submit brief documents of wetlands within two weeks, as per the directions of the court. This is an important step in ensuring that accurate information is available about the wetlands in Maharashtra and that appropriate action can be taken to protect them.

The court also directed the Principal Secretary (Environment) to look into the grievance of the petitioner regarding the submission of incorrect data on wetlands by the Under Secretary, Environment Department. This shows that the court is taking a proactive approach to ensuring that accurate information is available and that all parties are held accountable for their actions.

Overall, these orders demonstrate the court's commitment to protecting wetlands in Maharashtra and ensuring that appropriate action is taken to prevent their destruction and reclamation. By ordering a ban on the destruction and reclamation of wetlands identified in the National Wetland Atlas and directing relevant parties to prepare brief documents on wetlands, the court is taking important steps to protect these vital ecosystems.
