The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Yogendra Singh Dohrey against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Ayodhya Prakaran, Lucknow in S.T.No.446 of 2009 and S.T.No.447 of 2009. The accused had moved an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling prosecution witness P.W.-10 Shashi Gupta for further cross-examination, which was rejected by the trial judge. The accused filed a revision against this order, but the court dismissed it, stating that the order was an interlocutory order and the revision against it was not competent under the provisions of Section 397(2) Cr.P.C.

The case in question involved the accused, Yogendra Singh Dohrey, who had been charged with various offenses under the Indian Penal Code, including criminal conspiracy, rioting, and attempt to murder. The prosecution had presented several witnesses, including Shashi Gupta, who had testified against the accused. During the trial, the accused had moved an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling Shashi Gupta for further cross-examination. However, the trial judge had rejected this application, stating that the accused had already been given ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness and that recalling the witness at this stage would delay the trial unnecessarily.

The accused had then filed a revision against this order, arguing that the trial judge had erred in rejecting his application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. The accused had contended that he had not been given a fair opportunity to cross-examine Shashi Gupta and that recalling the witness was necessary for the proper conduct of the trial. However, the court dismissed the revision, stating that the order passed by the trial judge was an interlocutory order and that the revision against it was not competent under the provisions of Section 397(2) Cr.P.C.

Section 311 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to summon any person as a witness or to recall and re-examine any person already examined if it appears to the court that such a step is necessary for the proper disposal of the case. The section is intended to ensure that all relevant facts are brought before the court and that the truth is ascertained. However, the power conferred by this section is not absolute and must be exercised judiciously and in the interests of justice.

In the present case, the trial judge had exercised his discretion in rejecting the accused's application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. The judge had noted that the accused had already been given ample opportunity to cross-examine Shashi Gupta and that recalling the witness at this stage would delay the trial unnecessarily. The judge had also observed that the accused had not made out a strong case for recalling the witness and that the interests of justice did not require the witness to be recalled.

The accused had challenged this order by filing a revision before the court. However, the court had dismissed the revision, stating that the order passed by the trial judge was an interlocutory order and that the revision against it was not competent under the provisions of Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. provides that no revision shall lie against an interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code, except where such order-

(a) affects the jurisdiction of the court to try the case,

(b) affects the decision of the case on merits, or

(c) causes irreparable injury to the party against whom it is passed.

In the present case, the court held that the order passed by the trial judge did not fall under any of these categories and was therefore not amenable to revision under Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. The court observed that the accused could challenge the order at the time of the final judgment and that his rights would not be prejudiced by the rejection of his application under Section 311 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Yogendra Singh Dohrey against the order passed by the trial judge rejecting his application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling prosecution witness Shashi Gupta for further cross-examination. The court dismissed the revision, stating that the order passed by the trial judge was an interlocutory order and that the revision against it was not competent under the provisions of Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. The court held that the trial judge had exercised his discretion judiciously in rejecting the accused's application and that the interests of justice did not require the witness to be recalled. The accused's rights were not prejudiced by the rejection of his application and he could challenge the order at the time of the final judgment.
