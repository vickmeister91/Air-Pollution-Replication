The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. and the Union of India & Ors. The company had obtained clearance to set up a copper smelter plant in Tuticorin, subject to certain conditions. However, the National Trust for Clean Environment challenged the environmental clearance and consent orders granted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The Madras High Court ultimately directed the company to close down its plant and compensate its employees under the Industrial Disputes Act. The company appealed the decision, arguing that the TNPCB's stipulation that the plant be located 25 km away from ecologically sensitive areas was not based on any notification issued by the Central Government. The company also argued that a public hearing was not mandatory during the Environmental Impact Assessment process and that the Rapid EIA conducted before granting clearance was conducted in accordance with guidelines. The company further argued that the TNPCB's stipulation regarding the development of a green belt was reduced from 250 meters to 10-15 meters.

The court order discusses the arguments made by both the appellant-company and the writ petitioners-respondents regarding the closure of the plant in Tuticorin. The appellant-company argued that the conditions laid down by TNPCB were impossible to meet and that the plant did not cause severe pollution in the area. They also highlighted the economic benefits of the plant. On the other hand, the writ petitioners-respondents argued that the plant was located in an ecologically sensitive area and did not develop a green belt of the required width. They also claimed that the plant caused severe pollution and made false statements in their Special Leave Petitions. The court considered all arguments and made a decision based on the evidence presented.

The National Trust for Clean Environment filed writ petitions before the High Court, claiming that the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the TNPCB did not consider the nature of the industry and its pollution impact on the environment and people living nearby. The court held that a right to a clean environment is part of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and that the authorities must apply the precautionary principle and the principle of sustainable development when granting environmental clearance and consent. The court found that the Rapid EIA relied on by the appellants was inadequate and that the authorities did not apply their minds before granting clearance and consent. The court also found that the plant was polluting the environment and ordered its closure. The authorities argued that the plant had a zero effluent discharge and that the TNPCB was monitoring emissions to maintain air quality standards. The court held that the High Court had the power to interfere with environmental clearances granted by the authorities and that the plant's location violated restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the Central Government.

The court order discusses a case where the environmental clearance for a plant was challenged on the grounds of procedural impropriety and irrationality. The court found that the notification at the time did not require a mandatory public hearing, and the clearance was granted after a detailed examination of the project. The court also found that the decision to grant clearance could only be challenged on the grounds of illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety. The court further found that the plant's location violated a condition of the Consent Order issued by the TNPCB under the Water Act, and directed the closure of the plant.

The court order discusses a Consent Order issued by the TNPCB under the Water Act in 1995, granting permission to Sterlite Industries to establish a copper smelter plant in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex in Tuticorin Taluk. The order also includes special conditions, such as the requirement for a green belt around the plant and a distance of 25 km from ecological sensitive areas. The court concludes that the High Court could not have directed the closure of the plant based on the violation of these conditions, but if the plant continues to pollute the environment, the High Court could still order its closure. The court also notes that the NEERI report of 2005 found that the plant site was severely polluted and that the ground samples contained hazardous waste.

The court order discusses a report by NEERI on the environmental impact of a plant. While some emissions were within limits, others did not conform to standards. Water samples were within drinking water limits, but groundwater had high mineral content. Soil samples showed heavy metal presence. The CPCB deemed the slag non-hazardous. The court ordered a joint inspection and directed the TNPCB to issue directions to the plant to remove deficiencies. The report did not warrant closure of the plant.

The court ordered the TNPCB to issue directions to the appellants to remove deficiencies in their plant as indicated in a chart. A joint inspection report showed that the appellants complied with 29 out of 30 directions, and the remaining direction was in the final stage of erection. The court set aside the order to close the plant. However, the appellant company was held liable for a compensation of Rs. 100 crores for polluting the environment and operating the plant without a renewal of consents by the TNPCB. The court appreciated the writ petitioners and interveners for taking up the cause of the environment.

The court order (1996) 3 SCC 211 encourages voluntary bodies that work towards public interest, particularly for the environment. The court allows the appeals and sets aside the judgment of the High Court.
