The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner, a daily wager with the Indore Municipal Corporation, had his services terminated by the respondent on the grounds of violating the M.P. Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1965. The petitioner denied the allegations made against him and submitted a reply stating that he was collecting fees as directed by the Municipal Corporation and that the report lodged against him was false and frivolous. The court found that the order terminating the petitioner's services was stigmatic in nature and violated the principles of natural justice and fair play. The court cited the audi alteram partem rule, which states that no one should be condemned unheard, and emphasized the importance of giving a fair opportunity to both parties to present their case.

The court order also discusses the concept of natural justice and how it has evolved over time. It explains that natural justice is not always explicitly stated in statutes or rules, but can be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed. The order outlines two basic rules of natural justice in judicial and administrative processes: "nemo judex in causa sua" (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The order also mentions the "useless formality theory" and how it relates to cases where natural justice is breached.

The court order further discusses the issue of proving prejudice in cases where natural justice is not followed. There is a divergence of opinion on whether the applicant needs to prove a case of substance or a "real likelihood" of success. The court can refuse writs even if natural justice is not followed. In this case, the court found that the respondent violated natural justice and fair play, and ordered the petitioner to be reinstated in service.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and fair play, which are fundamental to a democratic society. The court's emphasis on the audi alteram partem rule highlights the importance of giving both parties a fair opportunity to present their case. The court's discussion of the evolution of natural justice and its basic rules provides a useful framework for understanding the concept and its application in judicial and administrative processes.

The court's discussion of the useless formality theory is also noteworthy as it highlights the importance of ensuring that natural justice is not reduced to a mere formality. The court's finding that the respondent violated natural justice and fair play and the order to reinstate the petitioner in service is a clear message to employers that they cannot terminate an employee's services without following due process.

The court's discussion of the issue of proving prejudice in cases where natural justice is not followed is also significant as it provides clarity on the standard of proof required. The court's finding that the applicant does not need to prove a case of substance but only a real likelihood of success is a welcome development as it makes it easier for applicants to seek redress in cases where natural justice is breached.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a significant development in the jurisprudence of natural justice and fair play. The court's emphasis on the audi alteram partem rule, the basic rules of natural justice, and the useless formality theory provides a useful framework for understanding the concept and its application in judicial and administrative processes. The court's finding that the respondent violated natural justice and fair play and the order to reinstate the petitioner in service is a clear message to employers that they cannot terminate an employee's services without following due process.
