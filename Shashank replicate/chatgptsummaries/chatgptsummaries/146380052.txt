In a recent court order, the government has been directed to disburse compensation to petitioners whose lands were declared as Kudremukha National Park without receiving any compensation. The court has given a deadline of three months for the government to disburse the compensation amount to the petitioners. The court has also allowed the petitioners to seek enhancement of market value if they are not satisfied with the determination of amounts in the Deputy Commissioner's award. However, no costs were awarded in this case.

The case pertains to the declaration of the petitioners' lands as Kudremukha National Park. The petitioners had not received any compensation for the same. The court has directed the government to disburse the compensation amount to the petitioners within three months. This is a significant relief for the petitioners who have been waiting for compensation for a long time.

The court has also allowed the petitioners to seek enhancement of market value if they are not satisfied with the determination of amounts in the Deputy Commissioner's award. This means that if the petitioners feel that the compensation amount determined by the Deputy Commissioner is not adequate, they can seek enhancement of the market value of their lands. This is a significant relief for the petitioners as it gives them the opportunity to get a fair compensation for their lands.

However, the court has not awarded any costs in this case. This means that the petitioners will not be reimbursed for any legal expenses incurred by them in pursuing this case. This is a minor setback for the petitioners, but it does not take away from the fact that they have been granted compensation for their lands.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is a significant relief for the petitioners whose lands were declared as Kudremukha National Park without receiving any compensation. The government has been directed to disburse the compensation amount to the petitioners within three months. The court has also allowed the petitioners to seek enhancement of market value if they are not satisfied with the determination of amounts in the Deputy Commissioner's award. While no costs were awarded in this case, the fact that the petitioners have been granted compensation for their lands is a major victory for them.
