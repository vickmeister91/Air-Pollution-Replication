The court has recently issued several orders pertaining to different cases. The first order relates to a writ petition filed by Ambujam Rajagopalan and others seeking possession of a property based on a common order of the Forest Tribunal. The petitioners have also requested the respondents to pass orders on their representations without any further delay. The court has heard the case and will deliver a judgment on the matter.

The second order pertains to a dispute over the ownership of certain properties in Pampadi and Thiruvallamala Village. The petitioners had filed a case before the Forest Tribunal under the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, which was allowed by the Tribunal. However, the State appealed against the order and it was set aside by the court. The matter was remanded back to the Tribunal, which found that the petitioners were entitled to benefits under Section 33 of the Act. The petitioners claimed that the properties were not forest land and were liable to be exempted from vesting. The court directed the restoration of 2.98 acres of undisputed property to the petitioners and ordered the Settlement Officer to process any claims made by the petitioners with respect to the remaining property. The petitioners were also allowed to proceed against the inclusion of 4.74 acres of property as ecologically fragile land under the provisions of the Kerala Forests (Vesting and Management of Ecologically Fragile Land) Act, 2003.

The third court order disposes of a writ petition and orders the competent authority to classify 4.74 acres of property as ecologically fragile land in accordance with the provisions of Act, 2003. The order is signed by Judge Shaji P. Chaly and includes a list of exhibits submitted by the petitioner.

The fourth court order includes exhibits of various documents, including sketches and replies issued by different departments in response to a petitioner's request under the RTI Act. The order does not provide any specific information about the content or context of these documents.
