The court orders discussed pertain to environmental violations by industrial units in Gujarat, India. In the first case, a group of industrial units challenged the action taken by the State Government under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The government had issued directions to these units to stop production activities and make the waste water conform to the standards specified by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court heard arguments from both sides and found that the units had not complied with the conditions of the consent letters given by the State Board under Section 25(2) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also noted that the discharge of trade effluents and polluted waste water had caused damage to crops and fertile lands in Kheda District. The court ultimately upheld the government's actions.

In the second case, the court discussed the violation of environmental regulations by three companies in Gujarat. The State Board found that the companies were discharging effluents without proper treatment, and their effluent exceeded the prescribed tolerance limits. The court notes that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 empowers the Central Government to issue directions to any person, officer, or authority to comply with environmental regulations. The Central Government has delegated this power to the State of Gujarat. The court also notes that the rules require the Central Government to provide an opportunity to file objections against proposed directions, but this requirement can be dispensed with if there is a likelihood of grave injury to the environment. The court finds that the State Government had a valid reason to issue directions to prevent the companies from discharging trade effluents in the Khari-cut Canal, which provides irrigation to vast areas in Kheda District.

In the third case, the court states that the Central Government can issue directions without providing an opportunity to file objections against them only if there is a likelihood of grave injury to the environment. The State Government had taken action to close down industries that were causing severe pollution to the irrigation canal and fertile land without giving a show cause notice, as the effluent being discharged was causing damage to crops and the environment. The State Government was fully empowered to dispense with the opportunity to file objections in such cases of grave injury to the environment. The petitioners did not operate an effluent treatment plant and could not be allowed to release untreated effluents resulting in damage to the fertile lands. The court rejected the petitions and vacated the stay, as extending it would cause harm to the environment.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the power of the government to take action to prevent harm to the environment. The court also emphasizes the need for companies to operate effluent treatment plants to prevent the release of untreated effluents that can cause damage to crops and fertile lands. The court's decisions ultimately prioritize the protection of the environment over the interests of industrial units that violate environmental regulations.
