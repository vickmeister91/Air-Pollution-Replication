The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals and provides that no person shall hunt any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV except as provided under Section 11 and Section 12 of the Act. Section 39 of the Act deals with the power of the Forest Officer to arrest without warrant any person who has committed an offence under the Act. Section 50 of the Act deals with the power of the Forest Officer to search and seize any property or article which he has reason to believe has been used for the commission of an offence under the Act. Section 51 of the Act deals with the power of the Forest Officer to enter and search any premises where he has reason to believe that an offence under the Act has been committed.

In the present case, Singh was accused of violating these provisions of the Act. However, his counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that all the offences were triable by the Magistrate. The court, after hearing the arguments put forth by Singh's counsel, allowed the bail application and directed that Singh be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in a sum of `25,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.
