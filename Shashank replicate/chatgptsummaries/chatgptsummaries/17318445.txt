Two court orders related to the Wildlife (Protection) Act have been summarized. The first order pertains to Arif Qureshi, who was found guilty of offences under Sections 44/49 and 49B(1) of the Act. The case was filed by Wild Life Inspector Aarti Singh, who had received information that Qureshi was selling shahtoosh shawls without the required license. During a raid, five shahtoosh shawls were recovered from Qureshi's shop, and he was unable to produce any documents or certificates required to deal in shahtoosh shawls. Qureshi denied all evidence against him and claimed false implication. The court rejected his arguments and upheld the conviction. Qureshi was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000.

The second court order discusses a case where the accused was charged with possession of shahtoosh shawls made from the wool of Tibetan antelopes, which is a scheduled animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The defense argued that the prosecution failed to establish that the shawls were contraband, as there was no expert opinion to confirm this. The court found that the prosecution had indeed failed to provide such evidence and therefore set aside the sentence. The accused was directed to furnish a personal bond and the trial court record was sent back.

The Wildlife (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, capturing, or killing of any wild animal or bird, and also prohibits trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Act provides for penalties and punishments for contravention of its provisions.

In the case of Arif Qureshi, the court found him guilty of offences under Sections 44/49 and 49B(1) of the Act. Section 44 prohibits the hunting of wild animals, while Section 49B(1) prohibits the sale, purchase, or possession of any animal article or trophy. Shahtoosh shawls are made from the wool of Tibetan antelopes, which are protected under the Act. The possession and sale of shahtoosh shawls without the required license is a violation of the Act.

During the raid on Qureshi's shop, five shahtoosh shawls were recovered, and he was unable to produce any documents or certificates required to deal in shahtoosh shawls. Qureshi denied all evidence against him and claimed false implication. However, the court rejected his arguments and upheld the conviction. Qureshi was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000.

In the second court order, the accused was charged with possession of shahtoosh shawls made from the wool of Tibetan antelopes. The defense argued that the prosecution failed to establish that the shawls were contraband, as there was no expert opinion to confirm this. The court found that the prosecution had indeed failed to provide such evidence and therefore set aside the sentence. The accused was directed to furnish a personal bond and the trial court record was sent back.

The court's decision in the second case highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to establish that an offence has been committed. In the absence of such evidence, the accused cannot be convicted. The court's decision also underscores the need for expert opinion in cases involving wildlife and wildlife products.

In conclusion, the Wildlife (Protection) Act is an important legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, capturing, or killing of any wild animal or bird, and also prohibits trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The court orders discussed in this summary highlight the consequences of violating the Act and the importance of providing sufficient evidence to establish an offence.
