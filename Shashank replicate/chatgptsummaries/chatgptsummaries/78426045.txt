The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various stone crusher owners who challenged orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners claimed that they had been operating their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners had filed objections and requested relevant documents, but the Board had not responded.

In one of the court orders, the court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter to the Board for fresh consideration. The court also addressed the issue of maintainability of the petitions, stating that the existence of an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to a person approaching the High Court under its writ jurisdiction. The court found that the impugned orders were legally untenable.

In another court order, the court discussed the powers of the Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court also addressed the distinction between orders and directions, and the right to file an appeal against them. The petitioners in the case argued that the Board violated the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The Board argued that it was justified in its actions and cited a similar case where the court upheld its decision. Ultimately, the court found that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court and that the impugned orders were legally untenable.

In yet another court order, the court discussed the legal requirements for obtaining consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond adequately. The court concluded that the impugned orders were legally unsustainable and invalid.

In another court order, the court discussed the renewal of consent for an industry and the State Board's ability to refuse consent if pollution control measures are not adequate or properly maintained. The court found that the Board did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims against the petitioner, M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher, and violated principles of natural justice. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of consent within four months, issue a temporary consent for one month, inspect the sites, and collect air samples. The State Government was also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, in one of the court orders, the court ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) was directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions were disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to stone crusher owners who challenged orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the Board had violated principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of consent within four months, issue a temporary consent for one month, inspect the sites, and collect air samples. The State Government was also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones. The court orders provide important guidance on the legal requirements for obtaining consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.
