The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard all the petitions together and made a common judgment.

One of the petitions involves a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves a calculation of NPV and the amount to be paid by the petitioners as a cluster.

Another petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to issue directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court order also pertains to a group of 136 mining lease holders in a forest area of 281 hectares in India. The mining lease holders were asked to pay a Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of their lease period, but they refused to pay for the entire 281 hectares and also did not segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department. The total common area being used by the mining lease holders will be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare, and each lease holder will pay their share.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances. The court heard all the petitions together and made a common judgment. The cases involve disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department.
