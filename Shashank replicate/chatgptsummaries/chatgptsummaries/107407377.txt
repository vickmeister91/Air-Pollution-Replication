The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by two individuals against a hollow bricks unit in Kerala. The petitioners alleged that the unit was operating without necessary licenses and permissions. However, the fifth respondent, who owned the unit, produced evidence of licenses and permissions obtained from the municipality and pollution control board. The court found that the petitioners had suppressed material facts and taken contrary stances in a previous suit and the writ petition. As a result, the writ petition was dismissed with a cost of Rs. 5,000 each to be paid by the petitioners to the fifth respondent.

The court order also allowed the fifth respondent to establish before the pollution control board that the unit was established prior to the relevant regulations. This means that if the fifth respondent can prove to the pollution control board that their unit was established before Exhibit P3, which is the relevant regulation, then they will not be in violation of any rules. The order was signed by Judge K. Vinod Chandran.

The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties. The petitioners alleged that the unit was operating without necessary licenses and permissions, but the fifth respondent produced evidence to the contrary. The court found that the petitioners had suppressed material facts and taken contrary stances in a previous suit and the writ petition. This means that the court believed that the petitioners were not being truthful in their allegations.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition with a cost of Rs. 5,000 each to be paid by the petitioners to the fifth respondent is significant. This means that the petitioners will have to pay a penalty for filing a false petition. The court's decision to allow the fifth respondent to establish before the pollution control board that the unit was established prior to the relevant regulations is also significant. This means that the fifth respondent will have an opportunity to prove that they are not in violation of any rules.

The court order also states that if there is a violation of the distance rule by the pollution control board, it will be considered by them. This means that if the pollution control board is found to be in violation of any rules, they will be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by two individuals against a hollow bricks unit in Kerala.
