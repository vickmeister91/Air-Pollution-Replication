The court order in question relates to a criminal case that took place in Rajasthan. The petitioners in the case had challenged the rejection of their application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioners had filed a petition for a fair investigation, which was allowed by the court. An enquiry report was subsequently submitted, which proved the innocence of the accused.

However, the trial court rejected the application to summon the report, stating that it carried no evidentiary value and was not relied upon by the prosecution in the charge-sheet. The petitioners then filed a misc. petition and a stay petition, both of which were dismissed by the court.

The case highlights the importance of fair investigations and the role that enquiry reports can play in proving the innocence of the accused. However, it also underscores the limitations of such reports in the eyes of the court, particularly when they are not relied upon by the prosecution.

The rejection of the petitioners' application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is significant, as this section allows for the production of documents or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The fact that the trial court rejected the application suggests that it did not consider the enquiry report to be relevant or necessary for the purposes of the trial.

The dismissal of the misc. petition and the stay petition further underscores the court's position on the matter. It is clear that the court did not consider the enquiry report to be of any evidentiary value, and therefore did not see any reason to summon it.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of fair investigations and the need for enquiry reports to be taken seriously. However, it also underscores the limitations of such reports in the eyes of the court, particularly when they are not relied upon by the prosecution. It is clear that the court in this case did not consider the enquiry report to be of any evidentiary value, and therefore did not see any reason to summon it.
