The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a petition filed by M/s. Baderiya Dairy Farm and another against the M.P. Pollution Control Board. The petitioners sought to set aside the order dated 12.12.2018 whereby the learned trial Court JMFC, Jabalpur in complaint case No.1418/2017, framed the charges against the applicants under Sections 41, 43 and 44 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974. The court found that there was sufficient prima facie material available against the applicants and that the powers envisaged under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., for invoking the inherent powers should be exercised sparingly in the condition of rarest in rare case. The court refused to quash the complaint.

The court order provides categories of cases where the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code can be exercised to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. These categories include situations where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint do not constitute any offense, where the allegations do not disclose a cognizable offense, where the evidence collected does not disclose the commission of any offense, where there is an express legal bar to the proceedings, where the proceeding is maliciously instituted, and more. The court finds that the case at hand does not fall under any of these categories and therefore dismisses the petition.
