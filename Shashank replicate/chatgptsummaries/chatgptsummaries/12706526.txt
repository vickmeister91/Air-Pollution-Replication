The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving tender bids for construction projects by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). In the first case, UEM India Private Limited challenged the rejection of their bid for a sewage treatment plant construction project. The petitioner claimed that their bid was rejected because they had been blacklisted by a government authority in the past, but the respondent denied this and accused the petitioner of creating a forged website to show that their commercial bid had been opened. The respondent also cited various reasons for rejecting the petitioner's bid, including delayed completion of a previous project and non-compliance with pollution control standards. The court heard arguments from both sides but did not make a final decision in this order.

In the second case, a petitioner filed a writ petition after their bid for a tender was rejected by HUDA. The petitioner argued that the rejection was unfair and challenged the eligibility of the successful bidder. The respondents denied the allegations and argued that the petitioner did not fulfill the necessary conditions. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The third court order states that a petitioner cannot challenge the validity of a blacklisting condition after participating in the tender process and being unsuccessful. The petitioner was unable to demonstrate that the condition was arbitrary or unreasonable. The court also examined the technical eligibility of the respondent and found that they fulfilled the necessary conditions. The petitioner's eligibility for opening a technical bid was also questioned due to their blacklisting. The court concluded that the petition had no merit.

The fourth court order discussed various issues related to the tendering process, including technical eligibility, blacklisting, and the scope of judicial review. The court cited previous cases to establish the principles of judicial review in the awarding of contracts, emphasizing the importance of adhering to essential conditions and avoiding arbitrariness or bias. The court ultimately ruled against the petitioner on several points, including their plea for waiver of blacklisting.

In the fifth case, the court stated that a contractor cannot take a different stand in relation to compliance of another part of the tender contract, and that a decision taken by the appropriate authority upon due consideration of the tender document submitted by all the tenderers on their own merits should not ordinarily be interfered with. The petitioner in this case was found to have misled and fabricated information, and therefore did not approach the court with clean hands. The award of the contract to respondent No.3 was found to be competitive and more suitable to perform the contract successfully.

The sixth court order discussed a petitioner who claimed that their bid had not been opened despite repeated follow-ups and meetings with officials. The petitioner had also allegedly created a forged website to show that their bid was opened. The court stated that the petitioner must approach the court with clean hands and cited previous cases where individuals who attempted to mislead the court were not entitled to relief. The court emphasized the importance of maintaining the purity of the court's atmosphere and administering justice fairly. Ultimately, the court dismissed the petitioner's writ petition with exemplary costs.

In the final court order, a writ petition was dismissed and a cost of 50,000 rupees was imposed. The respondents were entitled to costs equally. The purpose of the order was not only to address the wrong done but also to deter others from similar acts that undermine the justice system.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of adhering to essential conditions and avoiding arbitrariness or bias in the tendering process. They also emphasize the importance of approaching the court with clean hands and maintaining the purity of the court's atmosphere. While some petitions were dismissed, others were not decided in this order, indicating that the court carefully considers all arguments before making a decision.
