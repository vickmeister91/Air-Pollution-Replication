The case in question involved a petition filed by Vijay Singh under section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against the order passed by II ASJ Astha, District Sehore in S.T.No.214/2014. The petitioner had requested the enquiry report of S.I. Police Station Jawar at the stage of framing charge, but the application was rejected. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the order did not cause any prejudice to the applicant and he had the option to obtain a copy of the report under the R.T.I. Act or call for the document during the defence evidence.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not been able to demonstrate that the order had caused any prejudice to him. The court noted that the petitioner had the option to obtain a copy of the report under the R.T.I. Act or call for the document during the defence evidence. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to demonstrate that he had suffered any prejudice as a result of the order.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had not been able to demonstrate that the order was illegal or improper. The court noted that the order had been passed by a competent authority and that there was no evidence to suggest that the order was illegal or improper.

The court's decision was therefore based on a careful consideration of the facts and the law. The court concluded that the petitioner had not been able to demonstrate that the order had caused any prejudice to him and that the order was not illegal or improper. The court therefore dismissed the petition and sent a copy of the order to the trial court for information.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of demonstrating prejudice and illegality or impropriety when challenging court orders. It also underscores the importance of exploring all available options for obtaining information and evidence, such as the R.T.I. Act and calling for documents during the defence evidence.
