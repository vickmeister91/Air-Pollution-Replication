The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of three individuals who were charged with violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial court found that the prosecution did not follow mandatory provisions of the Rules. The appellate court upheld the acquittal, citing the principle that an appellate court should not interfere with a finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or a manifest error of law.

The court order states that the prosecution has not provided enough evidence to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The trial court's decision to acquit the respondent of the charges against him was justified and proper, and there was no illegality or infirmity committed. The appeal is dismissed, and the case is sent back to the trial court. Any bail bond is cancelled.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was enacted in 1974 to provide for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water. The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of pollution control committees at the district level.

The case in question involved three individuals who were charged with violating the Act. The prosecution alleged that the accused had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby river, which had caused pollution and harm to the environment. The trial court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.

The prosecution appealed the decision, arguing that the trial court had erred in its approach and that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove the charges against the accused. The appellate court, however, upheld the trial court's decision, stating that the prosecution had not provided enough evidence to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court order emphasized the importance of following mandatory provisions of the Rules and ensuring that the evidence presented is sufficient to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also reiterated the principle that an appellate court should not interfere with a finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or a manifest error of law.

The case highlights the need for strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations to prevent pollution and harm to the environment. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that the evidence presented in court is sufficient to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's decision to uphold the acquittal emphasizes the need for a fair and just legal system that protects the rights of the accused while also ensuring that justice is served.
