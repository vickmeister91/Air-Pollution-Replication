The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a group of agriculturists who were cultivating land without authorization. They had been granted land by the Assistant Commissioner in 1981, and had planted trees on it. They sought permission to cut and remove the trees, which was granted by the Deputy Conservator of Forests on payment of seigniorage value. The petitioners argued that they should not have to pay seigniorage value as the trees were planted by them after the land was granted to them. However, the court ruled that the grant certificate clearly indicated that the ownership of the trees would vest with the government, and that the petitioners could not claim title to the trees. The court also held that the petitioners were required to pay seigniorage value before felling the trees, and that permission and consent of the Central Empowerment Committee was required for felling trees.

The court order, reported in AIR 1997 SC1226, states that permission and consent of the Central Empowerment Committee is required for felling of trees. The same view was taken in a case disposed of on 14.06.2012. The court finds that the order passed by the competent authority cannot be questioned. The petitioners are advised to make necessary applications before the Central Empowerment Committee for permission to fell the trees. The writ petitions are disposed of accordingly. The respondent's counsel is directed to file a memo of appearance within 3 weeks.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the ownership and felling of trees on land granted to a group of agriculturists by the Assistant Commissioner in 1981. The petitioners had planted trees on the land and sought permission to cut and remove them, which was granted by the Deputy Conservator of Forests on payment of seigniorage value. However, the petitioners argued that they should not have to pay seigniorage value as the trees were planted by them after the land was granted to them. The court ruled that the grant certificate clearly indicated that the ownership of the trees would vest with the government, and that the petitioners could not claim title to the trees. The court also held that the petitioners were required to pay seigniorage value before felling the trees, and that permission and consent of the Central Empowerment Committee was required for felling trees.

The court order further emphasizes the requirement of permission and consent of the Central Empowerment Committee for felling of trees, as established in a previous case disposed of on 14.06.2012. The court finds that the order passed by the competent authority cannot be questioned and advises the petitioners to make necessary applications before the Central Empowerment Committee for permission to fell the trees. The writ petitions are disposed of accordingly.

The court's ruling highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary permissions before felling trees, even if they have been planted by the landowner. The ownership of trees on granted land vests with the government, and seigniorage value must be paid before felling them. The Central Empowerment Committee plays a crucial role in granting permission for felling trees and must be approached for the same. The court's order serves as a reminder to all landowners and cultivators to adhere to the established legal procedures and regulations while dealing with trees on their land.
