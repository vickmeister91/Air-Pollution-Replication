The court order discussed in this summary pertains to a public interest litigation filed by the Rajinder Nagar Welfare Association against the Delhi Water Board for not installing water meters as required by law. The court discusses the concept of public interest litigation and the role of the court in ensuring the observance of social and economic rescue programs for the benefit of the marginalized sections of society. The court also considers whether the citizens have a duty to pay for their actual water consumption even if the water meters are not installed. Ultimately, the court orders the Delhi Jal Board to install water meters of ISI/ISO standard to the respective water consumers within the National Capital Territory of Delhi and to stock water and avoid any shortage of water meters in the future.

The court order emphasizes the importance of public interest litigation in ensuring social and economic justice. The court has a dynamic and positive role in organizing proceedings, shaping relief, and supervising implementation. Good governance requires citizen participation and respect for the law. The case at hand involves scrutinizing the statutory scheme of Section 15 of the Act, which provides for power to require water supply and maintenance of service pipes. The responsibility for construction, maintenance, and operation of water supply arrangements lies with the occupant of the premises.

The court order states that the responsibility of supplying water for domestic or any other purpose lies with the Board, but the consumer is required to maintain, repair, and replace the pipelines. The Board has the power to provide water meters to measure consumption, and if they cannot provide them, citizens can buy their own meters of specific brands and standards as notified by the Board. The Board shall publish the same widely in the newspapers so that the consumers are made aware of the changed scenario. If the meter is installed, the Board shall do 100% billing as per the meter reading, and the installation fee and maintenance of the meter shall be paid in accordance with the regulations framed under Section 17(2) of the Act.

The court order highlights the importance of water meters in ensuring that citizens pay for their actual water consumption. The court notes that citizens have a duty to pay for the water they consume, even if the water meters are not installed. The court orders the Delhi Jal Board to install water meters of ISI/ISO standard to the respective water consumers within the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
