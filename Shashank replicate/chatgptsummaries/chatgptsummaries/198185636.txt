The first court order pertains to a case between Indian Overseas Bank and S U Kusugal. The plaintiff had appealed against the trial court's decision to dismiss their suit on the grounds of lack of territorial jurisdiction. The case involved a loan taken by the defendant, who had executed a promissory note and delivered a letter of hypothecation as collateral. The defendant's deceased father had also stood as a guarantor for the loan.

The court found that the trial court's decision was incorrect and that the defendants were liable to repay the loan amount. The court ordered that the defendants must pay the amount due or risk losing the mortgaged property. This means that the defendants are responsible for repaying the loan amount, failing which they may lose the property that was mortgaged as collateral.

The second court order states that the defendants are liable for the mortgaged property as their father acted as a guarantor. They are responsible for discharging the amounts due by their father as long as his property is in their possession. However, they are not personally liable to discharge any portion of the suit claims. Their liability is only to the extent of their inheritance.

In summary, both court orders pertain to a loan taken by the defendant, with the defendant's deceased father acting as a guarantor. The defendants are liable to repay the loan amount and risk losing the mortgaged property if they fail to do so. Additionally, they are responsible for discharging the amounts due by their father as long as his property is in their possession, but are not personally liable to discharge any portion of the suit claims beyond their inheritance.
