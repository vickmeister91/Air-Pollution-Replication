The case in question involves a criminal original petition filed by V. Jaganathan, the Director of M/s. Ramaniam Real Estates Private Limited. Jaganathan had been called as a prosecution witness in a case against Maragatha Mani for forgery, where he was P.W.2. However, the defacto-complainant, Mohan, filed a petition to recall Jaganathan for further cross-examination to establish the possession of the original power of attorney said to have been given to Maragatha Mani. Jaganathan denied having possession of the power of attorney and the court found no purpose in re-examining him. The court also questioned the defacto-complainant's individual capacity to file the petition and the court's permission to allow it.

The court order states that the defacto-complainant (petitioner) has no independent standing in the case and can only assist the prosecution through the state's agency, the police and public prosecutor. Therefore, any petition filed by the petitioner excluding the public prosecutor is irregular and cannot be maintained. The court sets aside the order passed by the lower court and dismisses two related petitions. No irregularity or inconsistency is found in the examination of P.W.2 by the APP.

In essence, the court found that the defacto-complainant did not have the standing to file a petition to recall Jaganathan as a prosecution witness in the case against Maragatha Mani. The court also found that any petition filed by the defacto-complainant excluding the public prosecutor is irregular and cannot be maintained. The court's decision to set aside the order passed by the lower court and dismiss two related petitions was based on these findings.

This case highlights the importance of understanding the legal standing of parties involved in a case and the proper procedures for filing petitions. It also emphasizes the role of the public prosecutor in assisting the prosecution and maintaining the integrity of the legal process. Overall, the court's decision serves to uphold the principles of justice and fairness in the legal system.
