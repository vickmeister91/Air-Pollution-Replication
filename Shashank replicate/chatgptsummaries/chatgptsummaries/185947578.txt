The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by T Narasimha Murthy against the State of Karnataka and Mr. Lakshman, Chairperson of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had challenged the appointment of Mr. Lakshman on the grounds that he lacked the requisite qualifications. However, the court found no merit in the petition and rejected it, making no order as to costs.

The petitioner, T Narasimha Murthy, had filed a writ petition challenging the appointment of Mr. Lakshman as the Chairperson of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had alleged that Mr. Lakshman did not possess the requisite qualifications for the post and that his appointment was therefore illegal and void.

The court, however, found no merit in the petitioner's contentions and dismissed the writ petition. The court observed that the petitioner had not produced any material to substantiate his allegations and that the appointment of Mr. Lakshman was made in accordance with the rules and regulations governing such appointments.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the appointment of Mr. Lakshman at the time of his appointment and had only raised the issue after Mr. Lakshman had assumed office. The court held that such a belated challenge was not maintainable and that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for interference by the court.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any specific allegations against Mr. Lakshman and that his challenge was based solely on the lack of qualifications. The court held that such a challenge was not sustainable in law and that the petitioner had failed to establish any illegality or irregularity in the appointment of Mr. Lakshman.

The court also rejected the petitioner's contention that the appointment of Mr. Lakshman was in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court observed that the petitioner had not been able to show how the principles of natural justice had been violated and that his contention was therefore without merit.

In conclusion, the court found no merit in the writ petition filed by T Narasimha Murthy and dismissed it. The court made no order as to costs.

This court order is significant as it upholds the appointment of Mr. Lakshman as the Chairperson of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and dismisses the allegations made against him by the petitioner. The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on the functioning of the Board and its ability to carry out its mandate effectively.
