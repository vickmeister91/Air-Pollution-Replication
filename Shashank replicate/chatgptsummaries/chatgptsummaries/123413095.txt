The court order pertains to a reference case made by a civil judge seeking answers to three questions related to encroachment on forest land and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The case involves a dispute between two brothers over a portion of land that was allegedly encroached upon by their father and later divided between them. The defendant had filed a suit for ownership of the land, which was decreed in his favor. The court is examining whether the civil court can regularize encroachment on forest land and whether a civil suit is maintainable in such cases.

The court order discusses a case where the defendant recorded his name in the record of rights pertaining to 2 hectares of land on the basis of a decree for declaration of ownership of land admeasuring 2 hectares from land Gat No.162 passed in Regular Civil Suit No.372/1998. The learned Civil Judge opined that the decree in Regular Civil Suit No.372/1998 is in contravention of Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. However, the court order states that the learned Civil Judge has misconstrued the phrases "State Government or other authority" used in Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 as well as "regularisation of encroachment" used in the Government Resolutions. The court clarifies that the term "other authority" used in a phrase "State Government" or other authority" means and includes instrumentalities or agencies of State Government and would not mean and include the Courts which have judicial functions to perform.

The court order discusses the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and its application to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification. The court clarifies that it is not the job of the Civil Court to regularize encroachments over forest land, but rather to adjudicate the rights of parties claiming land. The court also notes that Government Resolutions cannot be used to regularize encroachments in contravention of the Act. The order cites previous judgments and interpretations of the Act, including the definition of "forest" and the restrictions imposed on forest land use.

The court order prohibits the use of forest land for non-forest purposes, including cultivation of crops and medicinal plants, and breaking or clearing of any portion of the forest. Encroachment on forest land by private individuals or organizations is considered an invasion and cannot be regularized by the state. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 restricts the regulation of encroachment over forest land. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 defines environment as including water, air, land, and the inter-relationship between them and living creatures. Encroachment on forest land interferes with the environment and natural habitat of flora and fauna. The order clarifies that actions to regularize encroachment over forest land undertaken prior to the commencement of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, are saved from the Act's provisions.

This court order discusses the jurisdiction of civil courts in cases related to encroachment on forest land and the environment. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 creates new rights and obligations not previously existing in common law. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 gives the National Green Tribunal jurisdiction over civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment and arising out of the implementation of specified enactments. The Act also bars civil courts from entertaining appeals or settling disputes related to claims for compensation or restitution of property or environment damage that can be adjudicated upon by the Tribunal. Therefore, civil courts' jurisdiction is impliedly barred in such cases.

The court order states that civil cases related to substantial questions regarding the environment, specifically those arising from the implementation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, cannot be heard by the Civil Court. However, civil cases not related to substantial environmental questions and not arising from the implementation of specified enactments can still be heard by the Civil Court. The reference case in question has been disposed of with no costs.

In summary, the court order clarifies that the civil court cannot regularize encroachment on forest land and that its role is limited to adjudicating the rights of parties claiming land. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 prohibits the use of forest land for non-forest purposes and encroachment on forest land by private individuals or organizations is considered an invasion and cannot be regularized by the state. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 gives the National Green Tribunal jurisdiction over civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment and arising out of the implementation of specified enactments, and civil courts' jurisdiction is impliedly barred in such cases. Civil cases not related to substantial environmental questions and not arising from the implementation of specified enactments can still be heard by the Civil Court.
