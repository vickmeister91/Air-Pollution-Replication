The Madras High Court recently heard two cases related to civil suits challenging planning permission and building plans issued by competent authorities. In the first case, a Civil Revision Petition was filed challenging an order dismissing an application filed under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code. The petitioner, the 7th defendant in the suit, argued that the suit filed by the first respondent/plaintiff challenging the sanction of planning permission issued in favor of the petitioner for a cashew nut roasting industry was not maintainable before a Civil Court. The court found that the issue of jurisdiction under Section 46 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 did not arise, and the ground raised by the petitioner regarding the requirement of permission from the Pollution Control Board and alleged inspection by the authorities of the Board would be dealt with during the trial of the suit. The only question before the court was whether the prayer for declaration filed by the first respondent/plaintiff was maintainable before a Civil Court.

In the second case, the court order pertained to a dispute over the maintainability of a suit filed by the first respondent/plaintiff challenging a building plan issued by a competent authority. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the suit was not maintainable, while the first respondent/plaintiff objected to raising a new point as an additional ground. The court ruled that it was impermissible to raise a new ground for the first time in a revision under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the petitioner to file a written statement within one week and allowed the first respondent/plaintiff to file a reply statement if necessary. The court also ordered both parties to cooperate for the inspection of the suit property by an Advocate Commissioner appointed by the trial court. The trial court was directed to commence and proceed with the trial of the suit and dispose of it as early as possible. The court confirmed the order of the trial court and dismissed the civil revision petition.

In both cases, the court had to determine whether the suits filed by the first respondent/plaintiff were maintainable before a Civil Court. In the first case, the court found that the issue of jurisdiction under Section 46 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 did not arise, and the ground raised by the petitioner regarding the requirement of permission from the Pollution Control Board and alleged inspection by the authorities of the Board would be dealt with during the trial of the suit. The court only had to determine whether the prayer for declaration filed by the first respondent/plaintiff was maintainable before a Civil Court. In the second case, the court ruled that it was impermissible to raise a new ground for the first time in a revision under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the petitioner to file a written statement within one week and allowed the first respondent/plaintiff to file a reply statement if necessary. The court also ordered both parties to cooperate for the inspection of the suit property by an Advocate Commissioner appointed by the trial court. The trial court was directed to commence and proceed with the trial of the suit and dispose of it as early as possible.

Overall, the court orders in both cases emphasized the importance of following proper legal procedures and ensuring that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case. The court in the first case made it clear that issues related to jurisdiction and permission from the Pollution Control Board would be dealt with during the trial of the suit, while the court in the second case emphasized the need to file a written statement and cooperate with the Advocate Commissioner appointed by the trial court. Both courts directed the trial court to proceed with the trial of the suit and dispose of it as early as possible, highlighting the importance of timely resolution of legal disputes.
