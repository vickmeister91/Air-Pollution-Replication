The Association sought the court's intervention to ensure that the recommendations of the Zoological Survey of India were taken into account, and that the members of the petitioner-Association were given a personal hearing within a stipulated period of time.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the 1st respondent to consider the representations dated 30.09.2015 and 30.10.2015 given by the petitioner-Association and to dispose of the same, on merits and in accordance with law and based on the recommendations of ZSI, by affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioners, within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made. The court recognized the importance of the recommendations of the Zoological Survey of India in making an informed decision and directed the respondents to take them into account.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of the petitioner-Association to be heard and to have their representations considered in a fair and transparent manner. It also emphasizes the importance of scientific recommendations in decision-making processes, particularly in matters related to the environment and wildlife.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards ensuring that the rights of all parties are protected and that decisions are made in a fair and transparent manner. It sets an important precedent for future cases involving similar issues and highlights the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice in all decision-making processes.
