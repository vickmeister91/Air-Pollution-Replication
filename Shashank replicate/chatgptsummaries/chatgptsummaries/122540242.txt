The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by two individuals, Gopal and Veero, who were in judicial custody for an offense related to the transportation of Bajri. The court ultimately granted the bail application, but with certain conditions attached.

Firstly, the court directed the accused to furnish a personal bond and sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. This means that Gopal and Veero must provide a financial guarantee that they will appear before the trial court on all subsequent dates of hearing. The amount of the bond and sureties will be determined by the trial court, and must be sufficient to ensure that the accused will not abscond or fail to appear.

Secondly, the court ordered the accused to appear before the trial court on all subsequent dates of hearing. This is a standard condition of bail, and ensures that the accused remain engaged with the legal process and do not attempt to evade justice.

It is worth noting that the offense for which Gopal and Veero were in custody - the transportation of Bajri - is not specified in the court order. Bajri is a type of sand commonly used in construction, and it is possible that the accused were transporting it without the necessary permits or licenses.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Gopal and Veero suggests that the offense they are accused of is not considered to be particularly serious. However, the conditions attached to the bail ensure that the accused will remain engaged with the legal process and will not attempt to evade justice.
