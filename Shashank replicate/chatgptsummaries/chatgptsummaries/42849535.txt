The court order discussed in this summary pertains to a writ petition filed by Mansoor Ali Khan under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner requested a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to consider his representation dated 10/7/2018. The representation requested permission to test the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) for a continuous period of seven days, with the aid of experts/technically skilled people in this field, under the supervision of a retired Hon'ble Supreme Court or Hon'ble High Court Judge to demonstrate and prove that tampering is definitely taking place in the voting process using EVM.

The court informed the petitioner that he must study the pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and this Court, as to how and when a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) can be made. The court also referred to several decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on Public Interest writ petitions. The court held that public interest litigation is a weapon that has to be used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking.

The court order emphasizes the need to filter out frivolous petitions that are filed under the guise of public interest litigation. The court warns against imposters and busybodies who file such petitions for personal gain or extraneous motives. The court also notes that genuine litigants with legitimate grievances are often made to wait due to the flood of such frivolous petitions. The court stresses that public interest litigation should be used with care and circumspection and not as a tool for personal vendetta or publicity. The court also clarifies that a writ of mandamus can only be issued if the person claiming it establishes their legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is sought.

The court order discusses the guidelines for public interest litigation (PIL) and warns against the misuse of this tool. The court emphasizes the need for the petitioner to have genuine credentials and information, and for the information to be specific and serious. The court also warns against frivolous petitions and imposters who use PIL for personal gain or political motives. The court stresses the importance of maintaining a balance between protecting the public interest and avoiding encroachment on the executive and legislative spheres. The court also cites previous cases and judgments to support its guidelines for PIL.

The court order explains that a mandamus is a court order that directs a person or corporation to perform a specific legal duty that they are obligated to do. It is a summary writ that is used to enforce public duties prescribed by statute and to keep subordinate and inferior bodies and tribunals exercising public functions within their jurisdictions. The issuance of a mandamus is subject to the sound judicial discretion of the court, and it is not a writ of right. The court may consider the larger public interest before granting the writ. A mandamus may not be invoked to compel the matter of discretion to be exercised in any particular way unless there has been an abuse of discretion. The court dismissed a writ petition seeking a mandamus as it was deemed frivolous and made for publicity purposes.

In summary, the court order emphasizes the need for caution and circumspection in the use of public interest litigation as a tool for seeking justice. The court warns against frivolous petitions and imposters who use PIL for personal gain or political motives. The court stresses the importance of maintaining a balance between protecting the public interest and avoiding encroachment on the executive and legislative spheres. The court also clarifies the guidelines for issuing a writ of mandamus and the circumstances under which it can be invoked. Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the responsibility that comes with seeking justice through the legal system and the need to use legal tools judiciously.
