Ltd. and others for deficiency in service in not providing continuous power supply to their manufacturing unit. The complainant claimed losses of Rs. 25 lakhs and refund of Rs. 1.91 lakhs with interest. However, the court dismissed the complaint on the grounds of being time-barred and not maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 

The court found that the complaint was filed after a delay of more than two years from the date of the cause of action, which was the disruption of power supply to the complainant's manufacturing unit.

The court also noted that the complainant had not provided any valid reason for the delay in filing the complaint.

The court further held that the complaint was not maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as the complainant was not a consumer within the meaning of the Act. The court observed that the complainant was a manufacturer of chemicals and was using the power supply for its manufacturing process. The court held that the complainant was using the power supply for commercial purposes and was not a consumer as defined under the Act.

The court also rejected the complainant's claim for loss of reputation and loss suffered by the complainant company due to the illegal arrest of its Ex-Managing Director. The court held that these claims were not maintainable as they were not related to the deficiency in service alleged by the complainant. The court observed that the complainant had not provided any evidence to support its claims for loss of reputation and loss suffered by the company due to the arrest of its Ex-Managing Director.
