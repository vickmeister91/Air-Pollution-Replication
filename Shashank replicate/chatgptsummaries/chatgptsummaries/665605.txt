In a recent court order, the State was held liable for damages in a case where a man was electrocuted due to a broken live electric wire. The State had denied any negligence on their part and instead blamed the defendant for obtaining an illegal connection. However, the court found that the State was indeed responsible for the incident due to the negligence of its officials.

The court awarded compensation to the deceased's family, which was to be deposited with the court and given to the family in fixed deposits. This compensation was a result of the court's recognition of the legal position on negligence and strict liability in hazardous activities.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal position on negligence and strict liability in hazardous activities. Negligence refers to the failure to take reasonable care, while strict liability refers to the responsibility for harm caused by hazardous activities, regardless of fault.

In this case, the State was found to be negligent in their duty to ensure the safety of the public by not properly maintaining the electric wires. The court held that the State had a duty of care towards the public and that they had breached this duty by not taking adequate measures to prevent harm.

Furthermore, the court also recognized the principle of strict liability in hazardous activities. The State was engaged in a hazardous activity by maintaining electric wires, which posed a risk to the public. As such, the State was held strictly liable for any harm caused by this activity, regardless of fault.

The court's decision to award compensation to the deceased's family is a reflection of the importance of holding those responsible for hazardous activities accountable for any harm caused. The compensation serves as a form of justice for the family of the deceased and also acts as a deterrent for others who may engage in similar hazardous activities.

In conclusion, the recent court order highlights the legal position on negligence and strict liability in hazardous activities. The State was held liable for damages due to the negligence of its officials, and the court awarded compensation to the deceased's family. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of taking adequate measures to prevent harm in hazardous activities and holding those responsible accountable for any harm caused.
