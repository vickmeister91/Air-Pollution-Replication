The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri. Ramesh, who was accused of unauthorized occupation of forest land. The petitioner claimed to have been in possession of the land from time immemorial and prior to 1976. However, the court rejected the petition, citing the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the law declared by the Apex court in T.N.GODAVARMAN THIRUMULKPAD VS. UNION OF INDIA (AIR 1997 SC 1228). The court found the petition bereft of merit and dismissed it.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act was enacted to ensure that the country's forests are protected and conserved for future generations. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Committee for Conservation of Forests and Wildlife, which is responsible for advising the government on matters related to forest conservation.

The Act also provides for the establishment of State Forest Departments, which are responsible for the management and protection of forests in their respective states. The Act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act also provides for the imposition of penalties for violations of its provisions.

In the case at hand, the petitioner claimed to have been in possession of the forest land from time immemorial and prior to 1976. However, the court rejected this claim, citing the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court held that the Act prohibits the unauthorized occupation of forest land and that the petitioner's claim of possession was irrelevant in light of the Act's provisions.

The court also cited the law declared by the Apex court in T.N.GODAVARMAN THIRUMULKPAD VS. UNION OF INDIA (AIR 1997 SC 1228). In this case, the Apex court had held that the protection and conservation of forests is a constitutional mandate and that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a crucial tool in achieving this objective. The court had also held that the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes should be avoided as far as possible and that any such diversion should be subject to strict scrutiny.

The court in the present case found the petitioner's claim of possession to be irrelevant in light of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the law declared by the Apex court in T.N.GODAVARMAN THIRUMULKPAD VS. UNION OF INDIA (AIR 1997 SC 1228). The court held that the Act prohibits the unauthorized occupation of forest land and that the petitioner's claim of possession did not entitle him to occupy the land without the prior approval of the Central Government.

In conclusion, the court order in question is an important reminder of the need to protect and conserve our forests. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a crucial tool in achieving this objective and its provisions must be strictly enforced. The court's decision to reject the petitioner's claim of possession and to dismiss the petition is a welcome step in this direction. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to occupy forest land without the necessary approvals.
