The first court case involves a complaint filed by WLI Sh. R.S. Tyagi against Shakeel Khan for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by selling protected wild birds without a license. The accused was found selling various species of birds in a market and failed to produce legal documentation for their procurement. The prosecution presented evidence and witnesses, but the accused pleaded not guilty and was ultimately acquitted. The court order was issued on October 1, 2012.

In the second court order, the case involves the alleged possession of protected birds by the accused. The prosecution witnesses testified that the accused was caught with the birds, but the defense argued that there were discrepancies in the testimony and no independent witnesses were called. The court found that the lack of independent witnesses made the prosecution story doubtful and did not inspire confidence, and therefore acquitted the accused. The order also cites previous judgments that emphasize the importance of having independent witnesses in cases involving search and seizure.

The third court order discusses the importance of following proper procedure during search and seizure operations, as mandated by the law. The failure to do so can cast doubt on the legitimacy of the judicial process and may result in the court not relying on evidence obtained through such operations. The court also notes inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and the lack of corroboration from independent sources. Ultimately, the court finds that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquits the accused.

In summary, all three court orders involve cases related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the possession and sale of protected birds without a license. The first case resulted in the accused being acquitted despite evidence and witnesses presented by the prosecution. The second case highlights the importance of having independent witnesses in cases involving search and seizure, and the lack of such witnesses resulted in the accused being acquitted. The third case emphasizes the importance of following proper procedure during search and seizure operations and the need for corroboration from independent sources. In all three cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, resulting in the accused being acquitted.
