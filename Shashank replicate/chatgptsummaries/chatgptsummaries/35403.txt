In a recent case, the petitioner, Sabu.N.S., filed a petition for interim custody of a seized vehicle under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The vehicle had been seized by the authorities under the Wild Life Protection Act. The learned Magistrate dismissed the petition on the ground that Section 39(d) of the Wild Life Protection Act provides for confiscation, and therefore, interim custody cannot be granted. The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order and grant interim custody.

The court, in its analysis of the case, noted that the Wild Life Protection Act provides for the confiscation of property used for committing an offense under the Act. However, the court also noted that unless it is established that the vehicle was used for committing the offense, it cannot be treated as the property of the government. The court further observed that the petitioner had claimed to be the registered owner of the vehicle and had produced the relevant documents to support his claim.

Based on these observations, the court quashed the order of the Magistrate and directed him to reconsider the petition and grant interim custody if the petitioner is the registered owner, on sufficient conditions. The court also noted that the authorities could take appropriate steps to establish whether the vehicle was used for committing the offense under the Wild Life Protection Act.

This case highlights the importance of establishing the ownership and use of property before confiscating it under the Wild Life Protection Act. It also emphasizes the need for courts to carefully consider the facts and circumstances of each case before making a decision. In this case, the court recognized the petitioner's claim of ownership and directed the Magistrate to reconsider the petition and grant interim custody if the petitioner is the registered owner, on sufficient conditions.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder that the law must be applied in a fair and just manner, and that the rights of individuals must be protected. It also underscores the importance of due process and the need for courts to carefully consider the facts and circumstances of each case before making a decision.
