The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in a batch of cases where manufacturers of fly ash bricks challenged the collection of service charges by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Ltd. for the supply of fly ash. The memorandum issued by the Deputy Director, Fly Ash Utilisation, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, was challenged by TANGEDCO and was allowed by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. However, the Writ Appeals were allowed by the Hon'ble Division Bench, and the order passed by the learned Single Judge was set aside.

The court ordered that TANGEDCO is bound to follow the directions issued by the Union of India, which has statutory force, and the competent authority having prohibited the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The Writ Petitions were allowed, and the interim orders already granted were made absolute.

The issue at hand was the collection of service charges by TANGEDCO for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The manufacturers challenged this collection, arguing that the Union of India had issued directions prohibiting the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. TANGEDCO, however, argued that the memorandum issued by the Deputy Director, Fly Ash Utilisation, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, allowed for the collection of service charges.

The learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court initially allowed TANGEDCO's argument and permitted the collection of service charges. However, the Hon'ble Division Bench allowed the Writ Appeals and set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge. The court held that TANGEDCO is bound to follow the directions issued by the Union of India, which has statutory force, and the competent authority having prohibited the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Union of India had issued directions prohibiting the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The court held that TANGEDCO was bound to follow these directions, which had statutory force. The court also noted that the competent authority had prohibited the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers.

In light of these facts, the court allowed the Writ Petitions and made the interim orders already granted absolute. This means that TANGEDCO is no longer permitted to collect service charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is significant because it clarifies the legal position on the collection of service charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The court's decision is based on the directions issued by the Union of India, which have statutory force, and the competent authority's prohibition on the collection of any charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. As a result, TANGEDCO is no longer permitted to collect service charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers.
