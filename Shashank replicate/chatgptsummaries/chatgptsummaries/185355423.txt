A recent court order in Rajasthan pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is challenging the decision of the Lower Appellate Court to allow the accused to submit their Adhar Card and PAN Card to determine their age. The accused had claimed to be a minor at the time of the incident, and the petitioner is arguing that the Lower Appellate Court's decision to accept these documents as proof of age is incorrect.

The court has issued a notice to the respondents and directed the Lower Appellate Court to adjourn the hearing of the criminal appeal beyond the date fixed in this Court. This means that the case will be postponed until further notice, and the accused will not be able to use their Adhar Card and PAN Card as proof of age until the matter is resolved.

The use of Adhar Cards and PAN Cards as proof of age has been a contentious issue in India, with many arguing that these documents are not reliable indicators of age. In this case, the petitioner is arguing that the Lower Appellate Court should have relied on other forms of evidence to determine the accused's age, such as a birth certificate or school records.

The court's decision to issue a notice to the respondents and adjourn the hearing of the criminal appeal is significant, as it suggests that the court is taking the petitioner's arguments seriously. It also indicates that the court is aware of the potential implications of allowing Adhar Cards and PAN Cards to be used as proof of age in criminal cases.

The use of Adhar Cards and PAN Cards as proof of age has been a controversial issue in India for several years. While these documents are widely used for a variety of purposes, including opening bank accounts and applying for government subsidies, there are concerns about their reliability as proof of age.

One of the main concerns is that these documents can be easily forged or falsified, making it difficult to determine whether the person presenting them is actually the age they claim to be. This is particularly problematic in criminal cases, where the age of the accused can have a significant impact on the severity of the punishment they receive.

In this case, the petitioner is arguing that the Lower Appellate Court should have relied on more reliable forms of evidence to determine the accused's age. This could include a birth certificate, which is considered to be a more accurate indicator of age than Adhar Cards or PAN Cards.

The court's decision to issue a notice to the respondents and adjourn the hearing of the criminal appeal suggests that the court is aware of these concerns and is taking steps to address them. It also indicates that the court is willing to consider alternative forms of evidence when determining the age of the accused in criminal cases.

Overall, the court order in Rajasthan is an important development in the ongoing debate over the use of Adhar Cards and PAN Cards as proof of age. While these documents are widely used in India, there are concerns about their reliability, particularly in criminal cases. The court's decision to issue a notice to the respondents and adjourn the hearing of the criminal appeal suggests that the court is taking these concerns seriously and is willing to consider alternative forms of evidence when determining the age of the accused.
