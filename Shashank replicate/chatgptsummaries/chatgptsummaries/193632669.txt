In the first court order, the case was regarding the eviction of a tenant by the landlords on the grounds of subletting and damaging the shop. The landlords claimed that the tenant had sublet the shop to a third party without their consent and had caused substantial damage to the property. However, the court found that there was no concrete evidence of substantial damage to the shop and the evidence of subletting was vague and non-specific. The court referred to a previous judgment that stated two ingredients must be established to prove subletting as a ground for eviction: parting with possession of tenancy without the landlord's consent and in lieu of compensation or rent. The court found that the landlords had not established these ingredients and therefore were not entitled to any relief under the Delhi Rent Control Act.

The second court order discussed the burden of proof in cases of subletting or parting with possession of tenancy premises by a tenant in favor of a third party. The initial burden of proving subletting is on the landlord, but once they establish that a third party is in exclusive possession of the premises, the onus shifts to the tenant to prove the nature of occupation of such third party. In this case, the petitioners failed to prove that the respondent sublet the shop to any particular person or caused substantial damage to the tenanted shop. As a result, the petition was dismissed, and the file was consigned to the record room.

Both court orders highlight the importance of providing concrete evidence in cases of subletting and damage to tenanted property. Landlords must establish two ingredients to prove subletting as a ground for eviction: parting with possession of tenancy without the landlord's consent and in lieu of compensation or rent. If the landlord can establish that a third party is in exclusive possession of the premises, the onus shifts to the tenant to prove the nature of occupation of such third party. In both cases, the landlords failed to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, and as a result, the petitions were dismissed.

It is important for landlords to follow the proper legal procedures when seeking eviction of a tenant. The Delhi Rent Control Act provides guidelines for landlords to follow when seeking eviction of a tenant. Landlords must provide concrete evidence to support their claims and follow the proper legal procedures to ensure that their petitions are not dismissed. Tenants, on the other hand, must ensure that they do not violate the terms of their tenancy agreement and cause damage to the property. If they do, they may face eviction and legal action from their landlords.

In conclusion, both court orders emphasize the importance of providing concrete evidence in cases of subletting and damage to tenanted property. Landlords must establish two ingredients to prove subletting as a ground for eviction, and if they can establish that a third party is in exclusive possession of the premises, the onus shifts to the tenant to prove the nature of occupation of such third party. Tenants must ensure that they do not violate the terms of their tenancy agreement and cause damage to the property. By following the proper legal procedures and providing concrete evidence to support their claims, landlords and tenants can ensure that their rights are protected under the Delhi Rent Control Act.
