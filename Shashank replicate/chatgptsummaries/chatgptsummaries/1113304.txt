The first court order pertains to a case of contempt of court where the respondent was accused of breaching an injunction order by allowing third parties to occupy a property that was subject to the order. The court found the respondent guilty of wilfully breaching the order but accepted their unconditional apology and the fact that they had removed the offending parties from the property. The court also considered a request to remove the respondent from their position as an agent of the Court Receiver, which was appointed under the order of the court, but ultimately decided that it had the power to do so in the interest of justice. The court cited previous cases where it had exercised its inherent power to do justice in situations where the law did not provide for a remedy.

The second court order is from the Full Bench of the Madras High Court, which has ruled that no person can obstruct the path of justice and that anyone who violates a court order, whether a party or a stranger aiding or abetting the breach, can be subjected to the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The court has the power to make an order of restitution or restoration of the status quo ante as a consequence of the finding of guilt of disobedience. The court may also grant a mandatory injunction in a case in which a certain injunction is violated. The contemner in this case has been convicted of civil contempt of court and removed from receivership as agent of the Court Receiver.
