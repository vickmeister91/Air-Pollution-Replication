The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a revision petition against the order of the Ld. ACMM-1, Dwarka Courts, New Delhi, which imposed a fine of Rs. 5000/- on M/s. Anmol Collections for violating the notification dated 7.1.2009 issued by the Govt. of NCT of Delhi. The notification banned the use, sale, and storage of all kinds of plastic bags in certain places in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The court modified the order and imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000/- on the respondents, out of which Rs. 5,000/- shall be deposited with DLSA, Dwarka Courts, New Delhi, and Rs. 20,000/- shall be deposited in the Trial Court within one week from the date of the order.

The court's decision to increase the fine from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 25,000 was based on the severity of the violation. The use of plastic bags has been a major contributor to the pollution in Delhi, and the government has taken several measures to curb its usage. The notification dated 7.1.2009 was one such measure, and the violation of this notification was a serious offense.

The court's decision to divide the fine into two parts was also significant. Rs. 5,000 was to be deposited with DLSA, Dwarka Courts, New Delhi, which is the District Legal Services Authority. This organization provides legal aid and assistance to the underprivileged and marginalized sections of society. The deposit of Rs. 5,000 with DLSA was a way to ensure that the violator contributes to the welfare of society.

The remaining Rs. 20,000 was to be deposited in the Trial Court within one week from the date of the order. This amount was to be used to cover the cost of the proceedings. The court ordered that Rs. 10,000 out of this amount be released to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee as the cost of the proceedings. This was a way to compensate the DPCC for the expenses incurred in pursuing the case.

The court's decision to consign the revision file to the Record Room and send the Trial Court record back to the concerned court with a copy of the order was a routine procedure. This was done to ensure that the records were maintained properly and that the concerned authorities had access to them.

In conclusion, the court's decision to increase the fine from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 25,000 was a significant step towards curbing the use of plastic bags in Delhi. The division of the fine into two parts was also a way to ensure that the violator contributes to the welfare of society and compensates the DPCC for the expenses incurred in pursuing the case. The court's decision to consign the revision file to the Record Room and send the Trial Court record back to the concerned court with a copy of the order was a routine procedure to maintain proper records.
