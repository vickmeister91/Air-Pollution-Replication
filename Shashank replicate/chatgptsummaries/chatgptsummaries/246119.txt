The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner to quash two orders passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thalassery. The first order was to receive additional documents at the stage of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, and the second order was to direct the accused to produce documents. The petitioner challenged both orders on the grounds that they were illegal and without jurisdiction.

The High Court of Kerala heard the petition and considered the arguments put forth by both parties. With regards to the first order, the court found that the Magistrate had not considered whether the documents were essential for a just decision of the case. The court held that the Magistrate had erred in passing the order without considering the relevance and importance of the additional documents. As a result, the first order was quashed.

However, the court upheld the second order, which directed the accused to produce documents. The petitioner had argued that the order was illegal as it was passed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which only allows for the production of documents by a person who is not a party to the case. The petitioner contended that the accused was a party to the case and therefore could not be directed to produce documents under Section 91.

The court rejected this argument and held that the accused could be directed to produce documents under Section 91. The court noted that the section allows for the production of documents by any person who is in possession of them, regardless of whether they are a party to the case or not. The court also observed that the accused had not objected to the order when it was passed and had in fact produced some of the documents requested. Therefore, the second order was upheld.

In conclusion, the High Court of Kerala quashed the first order passed by the Magistrate to receive additional documents at the stage of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, as the Magistrate had not considered whether the documents were essential for a just decision of the case. However, the court upheld the second order, which directed the accused to produce documents, as the accused could be directed to produce documents under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court's decision clarifies the scope and applicability of Section 91 in criminal cases and provides guidance to lower courts on the proper exercise of their jurisdiction.
