The Indian judiciary has been instrumental in protecting the country's natural resources and wildlife. In two recent court orders, the judiciary has examined the government's decisions related to the reduction of the Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary and the proposed mining of limestone in a wildlife sanctuary. These orders have significant implications for the protection of India's natural resources and the balance between economic development and environmental conservation.

The first court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation challenging the State Government's decision to reduce the limit of Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary. The State Government had altered the boundary of the sanctuary in accordance with a resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly under Section 26-A(3) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court observed that the government did not have the power to invoke Section 21 of the General Clauses Act in the present case and that the power to alter the boundary had been expressly reserved with the State Legislature under Sub-section (3) of Section 26A.

The court also noted that the Wild Life Sanctuary in the Taluka of Lakhpat had been delimited from 765.79 sq. kms. to 444.23 sq. kms. after considering various aspects, including the need for economic development in the backward district of Kachchh. The court further observed that the word "Forest land" was not defined in the Indian Forest Act, 1927 or the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 or even in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of protecting India's natural resources and wildlife. The court's observation that the power to alter the boundary of a sanctuary is reserved with the State Legislature under Sub-section (3) of Section 26A is crucial in ensuring that such decisions are made after due consideration of all relevant factors, including the need for economic development.

The second court order discusses a case regarding the proposed mining of limestone in a wildlife sanctuary in India. The court considers definitions of "forest" and whether the land in question is classified as such. The court also examines various government approvals and environmental regulations related to the proposed mining project. The court ultimately rejects the petition against the mining project, citing the economic benefits and environmental protections in place.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental conservation. The court's observation that the proposed mining project has been approved after due consideration of all relevant factors, including environmental protections, is crucial in ensuring that such projects are carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner.

In conclusion, the two court orders discussed above highlight the importance of protecting India's natural resources and wildlife while also ensuring economic development. The judiciary's role in ensuring that such decisions are made after due consideration of all relevant factors is crucial in maintaining this balance. It is essential that the government and other stakeholders work together to ensure that India's natural resources are protected for future generations.
