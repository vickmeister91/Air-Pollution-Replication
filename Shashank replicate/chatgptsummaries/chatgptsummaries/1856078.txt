The Jharkhand High Court recently heard two cases involving the State of Jharkhand, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, and two individuals accused of operating industrial units without the Board's consent. The accused argued that the criminal case against them should be quashed because it was initiated on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR), which they claimed was not a valid form of complaint under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. 

The court considered the provisions of the Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure and ultimately ruled that the police were competent to investigate the case and that the criminal proceeding should not be quashed. The court order states that any offense under any law must be investigated, tried, or dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, subject to the provisions of the special law regulating the manner or place of investigation. 

The offense alleged in this case is punishable for six years, making it a cognizable offense. The police are obliged to reduce the offense into writing and investigate it as per the manner prescribed in subsequent sections. The court also cites previous cases where similar situations were dealt with under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court finds that the police are competent to register the case as the offense alleged is cognizable, and the applications are dismissed.

The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused for operating industrial units without obtaining the necessary consent from the Board. The police had registered a case against the accused based on the complaint filed by the Board. The accused had challenged the registration of the case, arguing that the complaint filed by the Board was not a valid form of complaint under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court examined the provisions of the Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure and found that the police were competent to investigate the case. The court noted that any offense under any law must be investigated, tried, or dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, subject to the provisions of the special law regulating the manner or place of investigation. The court found that the offense alleged in this case was punishable for six years, making it a cognizable offense.

The court also cited previous cases where similar situations were dealt with under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court found that the police were competent to register the case as the offense alleged was cognizable. The court dismissed the applications filed by the accused seeking to quash the criminal proceedings against them.

The court's ruling is significant as it clarifies the validity of complaints filed by regulatory bodies such as the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The ruling also reinforces the importance of following the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure while investigating and trying offenses under any law.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's recent ruling in the two cases involving the State of Jharkhand, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, and two individuals accused of operating industrial units without the Board's consent clarifies the validity of complaints filed by regulatory bodies and reinforces the importance of following the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure while investigating and trying offenses under any law.
