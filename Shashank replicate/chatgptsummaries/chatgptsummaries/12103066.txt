The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Vasant Chemicals Ltd. and the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB). The appellant argued that the levy of sewerage cess was illegal and contrary to the provisions of the HMWS&S Act. The High Court had previously upheld the levy of sewerage cess, stating that the appellant's industrial effluents were being carried to JETL and let into the sewerage system of the Board. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal.

The court order discusses a dispute between an industrial unit and the Board regarding the levy of sewerage cess. The industrial unit argues that it is not connected to the Board's sewerage system and therefore not liable to pay the cess. They also claim that the charges levied on them under an agreement with the Board are in effect sewerage cess and therefore a double levy is impermissible. The Board argues that the industrial unit is connected to their sewerage system and therefore liable to pay the cess. The court examines the relevant provisions of the HMWS&S Act and the agreement between the parties and concludes that the industrial unit is indeed liable to pay the cess.

The court found that the unit was liable to pay the cess as it was discharging its industrial effluents into the Board sewer line, which was ultimately carried to the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet. The court also noted that the dedicated pipeline from Jeedimetla Effluent Treatment Limited (JETL) to Kukutpally/Balanagar belonged to the Board, and that the effluents of the appellant industry were not of acceptable standards for the transmission system of the Board. The court ordered the appellant to pay the sewerage cess under Section 55 of the HMWS&S Act.

The court order states that the appellant is liable to pay sewerage cess under Section 55 of the Act as their effluents are ultimately let into the sewer line of the Board. The proviso to Section 55 of the Act exempts the occupier of premises not served by the sewerage system of the Board from paying the cess. However, since the appellant's effluents are let into the sewer line of the Board, they cannot claim exemption under the proviso. The court also discusses the agreements between the appellant and JETL for partial treatment of industrial effluents and concludes that the appellant is discharging its statutory obligation with the assistance of JETL. The court further states that the liability of the appellant to pay sewerage cess to the Board arises from the statute and the agreement between the parties. The court also explains the function of a proviso and concludes that it is a qualification of the preceding enactment and is not interpreted as stating a general rule.

The court rejects the appellant's argument that they are exempt from the cess due to an agreement with a third party and that they are already paying for the same service. The court also considers the plea of double taxation and concludes that the payments made by the appellant to the third party are contractual and not in reference to the statutory cess. The court upholds the statutory liability of the appellant to pay the sewerage cess and dismisses the appeal.

The court order also discusses the terms and conditions of an agreement between JETL and the Board regarding the discharge of industrial effluents into the Board's sewer system. The Board has levied various charges on JETL, including sewerage connection charges, maintenance charges, and surcharges for effluents that exceed prescribed limits. The court upholds the levy of sewerage cess as a statutory liability and dismisses JETL's contention of double levy. The court orders JETL to pay any arrears of sewerage cess with interest.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where an industrial unit was disputing the levy of sewerage cess by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB). The court found that the unit was liable to pay the cess as it was discharging its industrial effluents into the Board sewer line, which was ultimately carried to the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet. The court also noted that the dedicated pipeline from Jeedimetla Effluent Treatment Limited (JETL) to Kukutpally/Balanagar belonged to the Board, and that the effluents of the appellant industry were not of acceptable standards for the transmission system of the Board. The court ordered the appellant to pay the sewerage cess under Section 55 of the HMWS&S Act. The court also upholds the statutory liability of the appellant to pay the sewerage cess and dismisses the appeal.
