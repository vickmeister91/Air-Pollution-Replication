The court recently granted bail to Cheeka, also known as Krishna, in connection with a forest crime case registered against him and other co-accused persons for trapping a tiger. The court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case but allowed the bail application, ordering Krishna to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and one surety of the same amount to ensure his presence during the trial. The court also stated that if Krishna jumps bail, the court has the power to cancel his bail.

The case against Krishna and his co-accused persons was registered under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, for allegedly trapping a tiger in a forest area. The accused were charged with various offences, including hunting in a prohibited area, possession of prohibited weapons, and violation of the Wildlife Protection Act.

Krishna had filed a bail application before the court, stating that he was falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the alleged crime. He also submitted that he was suffering from various health issues and needed medical attention, which he could not receive while in custody.

The prosecution opposed the bail application, arguing that Krishna was a habitual offender and that there was a likelihood of him absconding if released on bail. The prosecution also submitted that the offence was serious in nature and that the accused had violated the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court granted bail to Krishna, subject to certain conditions. The court ordered Krishna to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and one surety of the same amount to ensure his presence during the trial. The court also directed Krishna to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The court further stated that if Krishna jumps bail, the court has the power to cancel his bail. The court also clarified that the grant of bail does not mean that the accused is acquitted of the charges against him. The trial will continue, and the accused will have to prove their innocence before the court.
