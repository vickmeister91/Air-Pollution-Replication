The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Theerthesh and Neelamma against a private complaint filed by H.V. Vishakantappa, H.V. Kumaraswamy, and Shanmuka for offenses under Sections 193, 209, 417, 468, 471, and 474 of IPC. The petitioners had prayed for quashing the order dated 15.11.2011 and 11.04.2012 in C.C.No.120/2008 on the file of the Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) and Additional C.J.M, Holenarasipura.

The court, however, rejected the petition, stating that the original lease deed was not available on record at the time of examining the prosecution witnesses, and it is necessary to confront the original lease deed to these witnesses. The court allowed the recall of PW.3 and 4 for the limited purpose of further cross-examination, confronting the original lease deed.

To understand the court order in detail, it is essential to understand the background of the case. The case in question pertains to a dispute over a piece of land in Holenarasipura. The land in question was leased out to one K. Narayanaswamy by the government in 1969. The lease was renewed in 1979 and 1989. In 1999, the lease was transferred to one H.V. Vishakantappa, who subsequently transferred it to his sons, H.V. Kumaraswamy and Shanmuka.

In 2008, Theerthesh and Neelamma filed a private complaint against Vishakantappa, Kumaraswamy, and Shanmuka, alleging that they had forged the lease deed and had illegally taken possession of the land. The complaint was filed under Sections 193, 209, 417, 468, 471, and 474 of IPC.

The case went to trial, and the prosecution examined several witnesses, including PW.3 and PW.4, who were the revenue officials who had issued the lease deed. However, during the trial, it was discovered that the original lease deed was not available on record. The defense argued that the lease deed was genuine and that the prosecution was trying to create a false case against them.

The court, however, was not convinced and stated that the original lease deed was necessary to confront the prosecution witnesses. The court allowed the recall of PW.3 and PW.4 for the limited purpose of further cross-examination, confronting the original lease deed.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of documentary evidence in criminal cases. In this case, the absence of the original lease deed had created a hurdle in the prosecution's case. The court's decision to allow the recall of witnesses for further cross-examination shows that the court is willing to take steps to ensure that justice is served.
