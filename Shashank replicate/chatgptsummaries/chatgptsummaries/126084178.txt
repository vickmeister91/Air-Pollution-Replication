The first court order pertains to a revision petition filed by M/S M.Sons Enterprises Pvt. Ltd against an order passed by the trial court dismissing their application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioners sought the production of documents in the possession of the respondent, which they claimed were material for cross-examination. The court found that the production of the documents was not relevant for the just decision of the case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court also noted that the petitioners had failed to explain the delay in moving the application and that the trial court had given cogent reasons for not ordering the production of the documents. The court held that the power of the court exercising revision jurisdiction is limited and that the revisional court is to interfere in the impugned order only if there is any illegality or material irregularity.

The second court order pertains to a petition regarding the issuance of a cheque. The trial court dismissed the application to produce certain documents, but the High Court directed the appellant to produce them. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeal and held that the revision filed by the respondent against the trial court's order was barred. The court also noted that the petitioners were attempting to delay the case and that their defense could not be based on irrelevant documents allegedly in the respondent's possession. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the trial court record to be sent back.
