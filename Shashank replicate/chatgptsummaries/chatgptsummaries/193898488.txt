In the case of Union Carbide Corporation vs Union of India, the court ordered an overall settlement of claims for $470 million and termination of all civil and criminal proceedings related to the Bhopal Gas Leak tragedy. The settlement was motivated by the urgent need for relief for the victims, who had suffered intense and unrelieved suffering. The court arrived at this sum based on offers and counter-offers made by both parties, as well as estimates of the number of fatal and serious personal injury cases. However, the court did not address certain legal questions related to liability of multi-national companies operating with dangerous technologies in developing countries. The settlement was made on the premise that the government had the exclusive statutory authority to represent and act on behalf of the victims.

The Bhopal Gas Leak tragedy was one of the worst industrial disasters in history, which occurred on the night of December 2-3, 1984, in the city of Bhopal, India. The disaster was caused by the release of toxic gas from a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Limited, a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation. The gas leak resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and caused permanent or temporary disability to hundreds of thousands of others. The disaster also had a devastating impact on the environment and the local economy.

The court order discusses the compensation for victims of a mass disaster, estimating the number of fatal cases and cases of permanent or temporary disability. The court also considers the need for specialized medical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as the broader issues of legal protection against hazardous industrial practices and the need for a national policy to protect national interests. The court emphasizes the importance of justice and truth in determining the compensation and acknowledges the fallibility of the judicial process. The court hopes that the settlement will bring immediate relief to the victims but also recognizes the possibility of miscarriage of justice and promises to undo any such injustice through legal procedures.
