The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently recalled an order dated 30.04.2019 and reserved the case for a final order. The case involves M/S Baderiya Farm and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, with charges framed against the applicants for offenses under various sections of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Water Act.

The court heard an application for correction and modification of the order and noted a mistake in the previous order, leading to its recall. The court had earlier directed the applicants to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs as a pre-condition for the grant of interim relief. However, the court noted that the order was passed without considering the relevant provisions of the Water Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court observed that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already deposited a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs with the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already obtained a consent to operate from the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board.

The court further observed that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already filed an appeal before the National Green Tribunal against the order of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already obtained an interim order from the National Green Tribunal.

The court also observed that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already submitted a bank guarantee of Rs. 5 lakhs to the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the order was passed without considering the fact that the applicants had already complied with the directions of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board.

The court, therefore, recalled the order dated 30.04.2019 and reserved the case for a final order. The court directed the parties to file their written submissions within two weeks and listed the matter for final hearing.

This case highlights the importance of considering all relevant facts and provisions before passing an order. The court's decision to recall the order and reserve the case for a final order shows that the court is committed to ensuring that justice is done in accordance with the law. It also shows that the court is willing to correct its mistakes and ensure that justice is done in a fair and impartial manner.
