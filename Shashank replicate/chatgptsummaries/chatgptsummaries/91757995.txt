The case at hand involves a petitioner who is seeking to set aside an order dismissing his application under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C to recall a witness for further cross-examination. The witness had already been cross-examined at length, but the petitioner argued that certain questions had not been asked. The court was tasked with determining whether the petitioner's request to recall the witness was valid.

The court began by acknowledging the importance of fairness in a trial. It noted that the power to recall a witness should only be exercised if there are valid reasons to believe that injustice has been caused to a party. The court emphasized that the power to recall a witness should not be used as a tool to prolong the trial or to harass the witness.

In this case, the court found that the witness had already been cross-examined at length. The petitioner's argument that certain questions had not been asked was not sufficient to warrant the recall of the witness. The court noted that the petitioner had ample opportunity to ask the questions during the initial cross-examination. The court also considered the potential hardship that recalling the witness would cause to both the witness and the investigation officer.

Based on these factors, the court dismissed the petitioner's application to recall the witness. The court emphasized that the power to recall a witness should be used sparingly and only in cases where there are valid reasons to believe that injustice has been caused to a party.

This case highlights the importance of fairness in a trial and the need to balance the interests of all parties involved. While the power to recall a witness can be a valuable tool in ensuring a fair trial, it should not be used as a means of harassment or to prolong the trial unnecessarily. The court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the power to recall a witness should be used sparingly and only in cases where there are valid reasons to do so.
