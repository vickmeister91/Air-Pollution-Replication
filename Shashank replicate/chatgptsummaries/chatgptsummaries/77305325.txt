The Godavari river, one of the main sources of water supply to the city of Nashik in India, has been considerably polluted due to various factors, including industrial waste and religious practices such as immersion of ashes and mass bathing. Citizens of Nashik filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking direction from the authorities to clean the polluted river. The court order pertains to this PIL and provides an overview of the case and mentions the parties involved, the dates of submissions and judgment, and the importance of the Godavari river in Hindu scriptures and Indian culture.

The court notes the importance of rivers and the need to take steps for rejuvenation and prevention of pollution. The citizens have a fundamental duty to protect the environment, and the state has a legal obligation to prevent pollution of the rivers. The court also discusses the legal and constitutional obligations of the State Government and the Municipal Corporation of City of Nashik. The court has issued several interim orders, including the appointment of a committee to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of NEERI, an expert authority. The court also discusses the issue of permission granted to M/s. Indiabulls to lift water from the river Godavari.

The court has constituted a committee headed by the Divisional Commissioner of Nashik to address pollution in the Godavari River. The committee will consist of various members, including the Commissioner of Nashik Municipal Corporation, the Collector of District Nashik, and representatives from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and NEERI. The court has also directed the Nashik Municipal Corporation to provide necessary staff and resources to the committee, and for the State Government to create a separate police force to assist with implementation of court orders. The court has also issued various directives related to the acquisition of land for sewage treatment plants, compliance with NEERI recommendations, and the implementation of a citizen awareness program.

The court order directs the Nashik Municipal Corporation to organize an awareness program for citizens to maintain the River Godavari free of pollution. The corporation is also directed to display boards at strategic locations calling upon the public not to throw garbage in the river and to create artificial ponds for immersion of ashes and other organic material. The order also appoints a committee to monitor the implementation of the recommendations and directions contained in the order. Additionally, the order contains directions for the Kumbh Mela in 2015, including the completion of construction of STPs and arrangements for garbage collection.

The court order mandates that during the Kumbh Mela, the Nashik Municipal Corporation must display banners and boards in different parts of the city to inform pilgrims and visitors that they are obligated to keep the Godavari clean and free of pollution. The order also directs the third respondent to file complaints for violations of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 in relation to the river Godavari. The Committee constituted under the orders of this Court shall set up a grievance redressal mechanism to enable the citizens to bring to the notice of the Committee the violations of law in relation to the river Godavari and the breaches of the orders of this Court. The court also discusses the legal position of fundamental rights under Article 21, directive principles, and fundamental duties of citizens. The doctrine of public trust and the precautionary principle are also discussed.

The court order discusses the catastrophic effects of disregarding environmental limits to economic growth. It emphasizes the absolute finiteness of the environment and the need to preserve sensitive resources. The court also discusses the Doctrine of the Public Trust, which holds that certain common properties like rivers, forests, and the air are held by the government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters, and forests are held in trust by the government for the benefit of the public.

The court order discusses the Public Trust Doctrine, which states that certain resources like air, sea, waters, and forests are meant for public use and enjoyment and should not be subject to private ownership or commercial use. The government is the trustee of these resources and has a legal duty to protect them. The court emphasizes that the doctrine cannot be abdicated by the executive and converted into private ownership unless it is necessary for the public good and in the public interest. The court also notes that the doctrine is applicable in India. The order cites a case where the doctrine puts an implicit embargo on the right of the state to transfer public properties to private parties if such transfer affects public interest. The doctrine imposes limits and obligations upon government agencies and their administrators on behalf of all people and especially future generations.

The court order emphasizes that natural resources such as forests, water bodies, and seashores are held by the state as a trustee on behalf of the people and future generations. The state cannot transfer public trust properties to a private party if it interferes with the public's right to access light, air, and water. The court can invoke the public trust doctrine to protect the environment and natural resources. The order also mentions the importance of sustainable development and the Precautionary Principle and Polluter Pays Principle in protecting the environment.

The court order discusses the duty of the state to improve public health and protect the environment, as outlined in the constitution and various laws. The Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle are considered part of environmental law in India. The
