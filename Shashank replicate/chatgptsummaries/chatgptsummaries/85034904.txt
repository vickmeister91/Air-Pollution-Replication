The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to Hotel Asian Plaza, which challenged the notice in court. The court ordered the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanctioned plans and beyond compoundable limits. The court also directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In another case, a petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan and compoundable limits under the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act. The court ordered the petitioner to demolish the excess construction if the vires of the amendment incorporated in the Act were struck down. The court noted that several similar cases of violation of municipal laws had been filed and passed separate orders in each case. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, which was allowed subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposed of the writ petition as having been withdrawn.
