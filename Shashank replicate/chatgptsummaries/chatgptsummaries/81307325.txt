The State of Haryana had appealed against a judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Civil Writ Petition No. 10611 of 2004. The High Court had quashed the notifications issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, regarding the acquisition of land measuring 129 kanals 14 marlas in village Lakarpur, District Faridabad. The High Court had also quashed the award passed by respondent No. 4 in respect of land owned by respondent No. 1 Eros City Developers Pvt. Ltd., which was acquired through the above-mentioned notifications. The subject land was proposed to be acquired for the purpose of expansion and systematic development of Surajkund Tourist Complex, which included development of parking area adjacent to the Surajkund Tourist Complex near annual Surajkund Fair. The acquisition of subject-land is thus not only in public interest but also to maintain the integral development of the Surajkund Complex in a unified and planned manner.

The court order dismisses a writ petition challenging the acquisition of land for the expansion and development of a tourist complex. The court cites previous cases to establish that the project must be judged as a whole and that the government is the best judge of whether the acquisition is for public purpose. The court also notes that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot be invoked if it harms public interest. The court finds that the purpose of the acquisition is a public purpose and that there is no illegality in the acquisition. The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgment and order are set aside.

Ltd. The High Court had held that the acquisition of land was not for a public purpose and that the notifications issued by the State of Haryana were illegal and void.
