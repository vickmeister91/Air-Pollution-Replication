The court order pertains to two separate criminal cases, both involving accused individuals who had been granted bail with certain conditions. In the first case (No. 20/2012) of Cyber Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, the petitioner, Mahesh Raghavan, was accused of harassing his wife for dowry and keeping her nude photographs on his laptop. He had applied for bail, which was granted with the condition that he surrender his passport. However, he later approached the court seeking interim custody of his passport, which was dismissed. The petitioner then filed a petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside the order and direct the court to release his passport. The court heard both parties and directed the petitioner to appear before the Mediation Centre to try for an amicable settlement. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with certain conditions, failing which his bail would be cancelled.

In the second case, the petitioner was one of the accused in a crime and had been granted bail with certain conditions. The additional 2nd respondent had filed a petition seeking cancellation of bail and surrender of the petitioner's passport, alleging non-compliance with the conditions. However, the court found the petition to be frivolous and lacking in merit, as there was no evidence of non-compliance. The court also noted that the parties had appeared before a mediation center but the matter could not be settled. The court disposed of the case, upholding the order granting bail to the petitioner.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of complying with the conditions of bail and directed the accused individuals to appear before the Mediation Centre to try for an amicable settlement. The court also warned that failure to comply with the conditions of bail would result in the cancellation of bail. These orders highlight the significance of following the conditions of bail and the role of mediation in resolving disputes.
