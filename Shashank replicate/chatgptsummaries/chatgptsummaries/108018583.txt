The case of Sachin Kadam involved a challenge to an order suspending the registration of his truck for 60 days. The order was passed by the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Chandur Railway, on the grounds that Kadam had allegedly transported sand beyond permissible limits. Kadam argued that the order was based on a different ground than the one mentioned in the show cause notice.

The court found that the order was unsustainable and quashed it, allowing the writ petition. The court held that the order was based on a ground that was not mentioned in the show cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the order did not provide any reasons for the suspension of the registration, which further violated the principles of natural justice.

The court emphasized that the right to carry on a trade or business is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India, and any restriction on this right must be reasonable and in the public interest. The court held that the order suspending the registration of Kadam's truck was not reasonable and was not in the public interest.

The court also noted that the order was passed without giving Kadam an opportunity to be heard, which further violated the principles of natural justice. The court held that Kadam had a right to be heard before any order was passed against him, and that this right had been violated in this case.

The court further held that the order was arbitrary and had been passed without any application of mind. The court noted that the order did not provide any reasons for the suspension of the registration, and that there was no evidence to support the allegation that Kadam had transported sand beyond permissible limits.

In conclusion, the court quashed the order suspending the registration of Kadam's truck and allowed the writ petition. The court emphasized the importance of natural justice and the right to carry on a trade or business, and held that any restriction on this right must be reasonable and in the public interest. The court also emphasized the importance of giving an opportunity to be heard before any order is passed against a person, and held that this right had been violated in this case.
