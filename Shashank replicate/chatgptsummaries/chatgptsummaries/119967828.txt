The Odisha Mining Corporation has filed two criminal miscellaneous cases under section 482 of the Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash the impugned orders dated 24.02.2014 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Jajpur Road in taking cognizance of offence under section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 (hereafter '1986 Act') and issuance of process against the accused persons in 2 (c) C.C. No.10 of 2014 and 2(c) C.C. No.12 of 2014. The pivotal question that arises in these cases is whether the petitioner Odisha Mining Corporation Ltd. (hereafter 'the Company') who has not been arrayed as an accused in the complaint cases can challenge the order of taking cognizance and issuance of process against other accused persons in anticipation that the Company might be arrayed as an accused in the proceedings at a later stage.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the N.I. Act and the liability of companies and their employees for offences committed under the Act. The court cites previous cases and legal provisions to support its conclusion that a company must be impleaded as an accused for a prosecution under section 141 of the Act, and that third parties generally do not have locus standi to challenge criminal proceedings. The order also defines the term "locus standi" and notes the court's evolving approach to this concept.

The court order discusses the concept of "locus standi" and the right of any person to seek justice for those who cannot approach the court themselves. It also discusses the criminal trial process and the duty of the state to prosecute offenders. The court cites previous cases to establish that a company must be arraigned as an accused for the prosecution of its employees to be legally maintainable. The court exercises its inherent powers to quash the proceedings against the accused persons in violation of the provision under 16 of the 1986 Act. The complainant is allowed to file fresh complaint cases in accordance with the law.
