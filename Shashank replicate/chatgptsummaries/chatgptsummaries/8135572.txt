In a court case involving the parents of a deceased woman who was hit and killed by a bus driven by the first respondent, the court found that the accident was caused by the rash and negligent driving of the first respondent, even though there was some negligence on the part of an unknown scooterist.

The court ordered the respondents to pay compensation to the parents.
