The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Kowa Spinners Limited against an order passed by the JMFC, Dharampuri, District Dhar with regard to charges under Sections 21, 37 and 39 of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974. The trial court had rejected the petitioner's request to accept photocopies of some documents as evidence, citing provisions of the Evidence Act. The High Court found no illegality in the trial court's order and dismissed the petition.

The case involved allegations of violation of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974 by Kowa Spinners Limited. The company had been charged under Sections 21, 37 and 39 of the Act for failing to comply with the provisions of the Act and for causing air pollution. The trial court had rejected the petitioner's request to accept photocopies of some documents as evidence, citing provisions of the Evidence Act. The petitioner had argued that the original documents were not available as they had been submitted to the Pollution Control Board. However, the trial court had held that the petitioner had failed to produce the original documents and had therefore rejected the request.

The petitioner had challenged the trial court's order before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The petitioner had contended that the trial court had erred in rejecting the request to accept photocopies of the documents as evidence. The petitioner had argued that the original documents were not available as they had been submitted to the Pollution Control Board and that the photocopies were certified copies of the original documents.

The High Court, however, found no illegality in the trial court's order. The High Court held that the trial court had rightly rejected the petitioner's request to accept photocopies of the documents as evidence. The High Court observed that the provisions of the Evidence Act clearly stipulate that secondary evidence can be admitted only in certain circumstances, such as when the original document is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of the opposite party. The High Court held that the petitioner had failed to establish that the original documents were not available and that the photocopies were certified copies of the original documents.

The High Court also observed that the trial court had rightly relied on the provisions of the Evidence Act and had rejected the petitioner's request to accept photocopies of the documents as evidence. The High Court held that the trial court had acted in accordance with the law and had not committed any illegality or irregularity in rejecting the petitioner's request.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Kowa Spinners Limited against an order passed by the JMFC, Dharampuri, District Dhar with regard to charges under Sections 21, 37 and 39 of the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974. The trial court had rejected the petitioner's request to accept photocopies of some documents as evidence, citing provisions of the Evidence Act. The High Court found no illegality in the trial court's order and dismissed the petition. The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Evidence Act and the need to produce original documents as evidence in court.
