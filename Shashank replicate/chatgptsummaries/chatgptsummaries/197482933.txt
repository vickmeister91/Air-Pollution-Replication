The Madras High Court recently issued a common order in response to three writ petitions filed by M/S. Surya Vijai Saw Mill, M/S. Krishnammal Wood Industries, and M/S. Kailash Wood Industries against the Junior Engineer (Electrical), the Conservator of Forest and Field Director, and the Member Secretary, Central Empowered Committee. The petitioners sought a writ of Certiorari to quash the proceedings passed by the first respondent in three separate cases.

The petitioners had obtained necessary clearances and paid taxes, and their mills were not situated in prohibited areas. However, the second respondent had issued closure orders without issuing show cause notices or hearing the petitioners. The petitioners argued that they had already obtained the necessary licenses and certificates from the Central Empowered Committee and that the closure orders were arbitrary and illegal.

After hearing the case, the court quashed the proceedings against the saw mills that were asked to obtain a license from the Central Empowered Committee. The court directed the petitioners to produce necessary certificates and licenses obtained from the Central Empowered Committee before the first respondent, who will then pass orders on merits and in accordance with the law.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had already obtained the necessary licenses and certificates from the Central Empowered Committee. The closure orders issued by the second respondent were therefore arbitrary and illegal. The court also noted that the closure orders were issued without issuing show cause notices or hearing the petitioners, which was a violation of natural justice.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of the petitioners to carry out their business activities without undue interference from the authorities. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of following due process and natural justice while taking any action against individuals or businesses.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's recent order in response to the three writ petitions filed by M/S. Surya Vijai Saw Mill, M/S. Krishnammal Wood Industries, and M/S. Kailash Wood Industries is a significant step towards upholding the rights of individuals and businesses. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of following due process and natural justice while taking any action against individuals or businesses.
