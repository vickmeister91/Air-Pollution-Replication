The Madras High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/s Kathiresan Blue Metals against the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had requested the court to quash the 1st respondent's proceedings and direct them to issue consent under Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and under the AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the petitioner's counsel made an endorsement stating that the writ petition had become infructuous due to subsequent amendments of rules, and the court disposed of the petition as infructuous.

The case involved M/s Kathiresan Blue Metals, a company that had applied for consent under the Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and under the AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board had issued a show-cause notice to the company, asking them to explain why their application for consent should not be rejected. The company had then filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court, seeking to quash the show-cause notice and direct the Pollution Control Board to issue consent.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the show-cause notice was illegal and arbitrary, and that the Pollution Control Board had not followed the proper procedure in issuing it. The counsel also argued that the company had complied with all the requirements of the Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that there was no reason for the Pollution Control Board to reject their application for consent.

However, the court found that the petitioner's arguments were not convincing. The court noted that the Pollution Control Board had issued the show-cause notice after conducting an inspection of the company's premises, and that the notice was based on the findings of the inspection. The court also noted that the company had not provided any evidence to show that they had complied with all the requirements of the Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court further observed that the petitioner's counsel had made an endorsement stating that the writ petition had become infructuous due to subsequent amendments of rules. The court noted that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the amendments, and that the amendments had the effect of rendering the writ petition infructuous. The court therefore disposed of the petition as infructuous.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by M/s Kathiresan Blue Metals against the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board. The court found that the show-cause notice issued by the Pollution Control Board was legal and based on the findings of an inspection of the company's premises. The court also noted that the petitioner's counsel had made an endorsement stating that the writ petition had become infructuous due to subsequent amendments of rules, and disposed of the petition as infructuous.
