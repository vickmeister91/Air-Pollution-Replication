The prosecution alleged that the applicants were involved in killing a male spotted deer and chopping it into pieces, which is a violation of Sections 2, 9, 39, 51 and 52 of Wild Life Protection Act. 

The court found that the applicants were absconding since the date of the incident and were involved in a serious nature of crime. Therefore, the court denied the bail application. This decision by the court is a significant step towards protecting wildlife and preserving the natural habitat of animals.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

The act has been amended several times to strengthen its provisions and to provide for stricter penalties for violations. The act provides for imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years, and also a fine which shall not be less than ten thousand rupees.
