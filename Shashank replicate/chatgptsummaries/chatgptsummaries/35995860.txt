The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by a petitioner challenging the notification issued by the first respondent to issue a license to quarry stone in the unassessed waste land belonging to the Government situated in S.No.418, Mettupatti Village, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District. The petitioner argued that the land is a hillock and consists of 175.45.0 Hectare land, wherein the villagers are carrying agriculture operation over an extent of 100 acres and the agriculture is the only source of livelihood for the villagers. The Forest Department has planted trees in the rest of the land under Social Forest Scheme, there is no access to the site and the same is through the water channel only and it would be destroyed if vehicles go through it and there are various wildlife, natural medicine, etc.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and found that there are many check valves to safeguard the interest of everyone. After complying with all legal requirements, the quarrying operation will commence. The court order states that there are many legal requirements in place to safeguard the interests of everyone when it comes to mining for minerals, including the need for a mining plan and environmental clearance. The petitioner's contention is deemed to be purely apprehension and not in the interest of the public. The court cites previous judgments to emphasize that public interest litigation should not be used for personal gain or private motives. The court finds that the petitioner has no locus standi to file the present writ petition and dismisses it.
