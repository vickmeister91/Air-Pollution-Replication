The Calcutta High Court recently heard an appeal against an order passed by a learned judge of the court issuing a Rule Nisi and an interim injunction on a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India filed by Guest Keen Williams Junior Management Staff Association and its five members. The writ petitioners contended that the company had a sound financial base and sufficient funds to pay its employees, but was luring them to a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The court examined whether the company could be considered an instrumentality or agency of the government and found that it did not satisfy the tests laid down by the Supreme Court.

The court order discusses whether a private corporation engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers can be considered an instrumentality or agency of the state and therefore subject to the discipline of fundamental rights. The court examines various factors such as government control and regulation, public interest, and potential harm to the community. Ultimately, the court decides that the corporation in question is not an instrumentality or agency of the state and therefore not subject to fundamental rights. The court emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting the scope of Article 12 and warns against widening its scope too far. The appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside.

The case before the Calcutta High Court involved a writ petition filed by the Guest Keen Williams Junior Management Staff Association and its five members. The petitioners contended that the company had a sound financial base and sufficient funds to pay its employees, but was luring them to a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The court examined whether the company could be considered an instrumentality or agency of the government and found that it did not satisfy the tests laid down by the Supreme Court.

The court noted that the tests laid down by the Supreme Court to determine whether an entity is an instrumentality or agency of the government are: (i) whether the entire share capital of the entity is held by the government; (ii) whether the entity is controlled by the government; and (iii) whether the functions of the entity are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions. The court found that the company did not satisfy any of these tests.

The court also noted that the mere fact that the company was engaged in a business that was of public importance did not make it an instrumentality or agency of the government. The court observed that the company was engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers, which was a business that was open to private enterprise. The court further observed that the company was not subject to any special privileges or immunities that were not available to other companies engaged in similar businesses.

The court also examined whether the company was subject to any government control or regulation. The court noted that the company was subject to certain regulations under the Factories Act, 1948 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the court found that these regulations did not amount to government control or regulation of the company.

The court also examined whether the company's functions were of public importance and closely related to governmental functions. The court noted that the company's functions were primarily commercial in nature and were not closely related to governmental functions. The court observed that the company was engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and fertilizers, which was a business that was open to private enterprise.

The court emphasized the need for caution in interpreting the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution, which defines the term "state" for the purposes of Part III of the Constitution. The court warned against widening the scope of Article 12 too far, as this could lead to private entities being subjected to fundamental rights. The court observed that the tests laid down by the Supreme Court to determine whether an entity is an instrumentality or agency of the government were intended to be restrictive, and that they should not be applied in a manner that would defeat the purpose of Part III of the Constitution.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court held that the company in question was not an instrumentality or agency of the government and was therefore not subject to fundamental rights. The court emphasized the need for caution in interpreting the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution and warned against widening its scope too far. The appeal was allowed and the impugned order was set aside.
