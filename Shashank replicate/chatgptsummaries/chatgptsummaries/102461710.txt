In the first court order, Mr. Firdous Ahmed filed a criminal appeal against his conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The case involved the seizure of 11 shahtoosh shawls made from the wool of Tibetan Antelope/Chiru, which is a protected species. The prosecution relied on the testimonies of several witnesses, including a wildlife inspector and a technical group from the Wildlife Institute. The court upheld the conviction and sentence, finding that the appellant was in possession of the illegal shawls.

In the second court order, the conviction of Firdous Ahmed for possessing 11 shahtoosh shawls made from the guard hairs of Tibetan Antelope, which is a banned species, was upheld. The testimonies of prosecution witnesses and the expert analysis of the shawls supported the conviction. However, the court also granted Ahmed probation of good conduct for one year, considering his young age, family responsibilities, and the fact that he had already paid the fine and spent 10 days in jail. He must maintain peace and good behavior and appear in court when summoned.

The two court orders are related to the same case involving the possession of illegal shahtoosh shawls made from the wool of Tibetan Antelope/Chiru, which is a protected species. The first court order focused on the criminal appeal filed by Mr. Firdous Ahmed against his conviction and sentence, while the second court order upheld his conviction but granted him probation of good conduct for one year.

In the first court order, the prosecution relied on the testimonies of several witnesses, including a wildlife inspector and a technical group from the Wildlife Institute. The court found that the appellant was in possession of the illegal shawls and upheld his conviction and sentence. This indicates that the court took the protection of wildlife seriously and was willing to punish those who violated the law.

In the second court order, the court upheld the conviction of Firdous Ahmed for possessing 11 shahtoosh shawls made from the guard hairs of Tibetan Antelope, which is a banned species. The testimonies of prosecution witnesses and the expert analysis of the shawls supported the conviction. However, the court also granted Ahmed probation of good conduct for one year, considering his young age, family responsibilities, and the fact that he had already paid the fine and spent 10 days in jail. This indicates that the court was willing to consider mitigating factors when deciding on the sentence.

The court's decision to grant Ahmed probation of good conduct for one year was based on several factors. First, the court considered his young age, which suggests that he may not have fully understood the seriousness of his actions. Second, the court considered his family responsibilities, which suggests that he may have been motivated by financial need. Finally, the court considered the fact that he had already paid the fine and spent 10 days in jail, which suggests that he had already suffered some consequences for his actions.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of protecting wildlife and the seriousness with which the courts take violations of wildlife protection laws. While the court was willing to consider mitigating factors in deciding on the sentence, it ultimately upheld the conviction and sent a message that such violations will not be tolerated.
