The first court order pertains to a case of eviction filed by a landlord against a tenant who was using the residential premises for commercial purposes. The landlord claimed bonafide requirement of the premises for personal use due to his old age and health issues. The tenant filed a leave to defend application, alleging that the landlord had concealed material facts and had fraudulent intentions. The court heard both sides and denied the leave to defend application, stating that the tenant had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The court ordered the eviction of the tenant from the premises.

The second court order pertains to a case where a petitioner, who is handicapped and dependent on his children, has filed for eviction of a property in Delhi that he had let out to the respondent. The petitioner has submitted various documents to support his claim, while the respondent has failed to raise any substantial objections. The court has considered the legal precedents and laid down criteria for determining "bonafide requirement" by the landlord. Ultimately, the court has granted the eviction order in favor of the petitioner, but with a six-month grace period before execution.
