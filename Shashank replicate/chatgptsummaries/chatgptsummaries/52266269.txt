The Patna High Court recently heard a case (17547 of 2017) brought by Anil Kumar Shrivastava against the State of Bihar, the Collector of Vaishali, the District Magistrate of Vaishali, the Sub Divisional Officer of Hajipur, and the Chairman and Regional Officer of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. Shrivastava was challenging two orders related to the operation of a unit that he owns. The court did not express an opinion on the merits of the case but informed Shrivastava that he could appeal the orders to the Board of Revenue under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court disposed of the writ petition with the liberty to Shrivastava to exhaust the appellate remedy available to him under the law.

The case brought by Shrivastava was related to two orders that he was challenging. The first order was issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board, which directed Shrivastava to shut down his unit due to non-compliance with pollution control norms. The second order was issued by the Sub Divisional Officer of Hajipur, which directed the electricity supply to Shrivastava's unit to be disconnected. Shrivastava challenged both these orders in the Patna High Court.

During the hearing, the court did not express an opinion on the merits of the case. Instead, the court informed Shrivastava that he could appeal the orders to the Board of Revenue under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court disposed of the writ petition with the liberty to Shrivastava to exhaust the appellate remedy available to him under the law.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a legislation that provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of appellate authorities to hear appeals against orders issued by the State Pollution Control Boards.

In this case, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board had issued an order directing Shrivastava to shut down his unit due to non-compliance with pollution control norms. Shrivastava had challenged this order in the Patna High Court. However, the court informed him that he could appeal the order to the Board of Revenue under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

Similarly, the Sub Divisional Officer of Hajipur had issued an order directing the electricity supply to Shrivastava's unit to be disconnected. Shrivastava had challenged this order in the Patna High Court. However, the court informed him that he could appeal the order to the Board of Revenue under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court disposed of the writ petition with the liberty to Shrivastava to exhaust the appellate remedy available to him under the law. This means that Shrivastava can now appeal the orders to the Board of Revenue under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Board of Revenue will then hear the appeals and decide on the merits of the case.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court recently heard a case brought by Anil Kumar Shrivastava against the State of Bihar, the Collector of Vaishali, the District Magistrate of Vaishali, the Sub Divisional Officer of Hajipur, and the Chairman and Regional Officer of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. Shrivastava was challenging two orders related to the operation of a unit that he owns.
