The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had ordered a company running a factory to stop its industrial activity without giving the company an opportunity to file objections. The company challenged this order in court, arguing that it was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice and the mandatory requirement of law. The court agreed with the company and directed the authorities to treat the order as a notice and give the company 15 days to file objections.

The court's decision was based on the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made. In this case, the company was not given an opportunity to present its case before the order was passed. This violated the company's right to be heard and was therefore a violation of natural justice.

The court also found that the order was passed in violation of the mandatory requirement of law. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is required to follow certain procedures before passing any order, including giving the affected party an opportunity to file objections. In this case, the Board did not follow these procedures and passed the order without giving the company a chance to file objections.

The court's decision to direct the authorities to treat the order as a notice and give the company 15 days to file objections was based on the principles of natural justice and the mandatory requirement of law. The court recognized that the company had a right to be heard and that the Board was required to follow certain procedures before passing any order.

The court's decision also recognized the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the rights of businesses. While it is important to protect the environment, it is also important to ensure that businesses are not unfairly targeted or prevented from operating without due process.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was a victory for the principles of natural justice and the mandatory requirement of law. It ensured that the company was given a fair hearing and that the Board followed the required procedures before passing any order. It also recognized the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the rights of businesses.
