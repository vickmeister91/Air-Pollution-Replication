The court order pertains to a case between A. Chowgule & Co. Ltd and Goa Foundation & Ors. The appellant had taken a decision to establish a 100% export-oriented unit in Sanguem Taluka, Goa, and had obtained various administrative sanctions and approvals. However, Respondent Nos. 1, 2, and 3 filed a writ petition in public interest before the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court, praying for a writ of certiorari for quashing the lease agreement dated 1st November 1989. The High Court allowed the writ petition and issued a writ of certiorari quashing the lease agreement. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that there had been no violation of the provisions of Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. However, the respondents argued that Section 2 of the Act and the Rules pre-supposed a prior approval of the Central Government as per the prescribed procedure before the dereservation of forest land, and formal approvals granted by any other agency or by the Central Government ex-post facto would not cure any defect in the dereservation. The court ultimately upheld the High Court's decision and directed Respondent No. 1 to restore the land to its original use.

The court order clarifies that the term "forest land" in Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act includes any area recorded as forest in government records, regardless of ownership. The provisions of the Act apply to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification. The court also dismisses an appeal by a company leasing forest land and emphasizes the importance of proper afforestation and reforestation to restore the ecosystem and prevent the destruction of wildlife habitats. The court notes that compensatory replantation with non-indigenous tree varieties is not a suitable solution. The appeal is dismissed, and no costs are awarded.

The court order states that prior approval is required for the diversion of any forest land and its use for some other purpose. The procedure for seeking approval involves submitting a proposal to the Central Government in the prescribed form and having it examined by a committee appointed under Rule 2-A within the parameters and guidelines postulated in Rule 5. The court finds that this procedure was not followed in the case at hand. The court also confirms that the land in question was indeed a forest and subject to the provisions of the Act. The appellant's claim that the lease was granted prior to the Act becoming operative is also found to be untenable. The court order emphasizes the importance of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 in checking further deforestation and maintaining ecological balance.

The court order is a significant development in the protection of forests and wildlife habitats in India. The court has clarified that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 applies to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification. This means that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes requires prior approval from the Central Government. The court has also emphasized the importance of proper afforestation and reforestation to restore the ecosystem and prevent the destruction of wildlife habitats.

The court has dismissed an appeal by a company leasing forest land, which highlights the need for companies to follow the proper procedures for seeking approval for the diversion of forest land. The court has also noted that compensatory replantation with non-indigenous tree varieties is not a suitable solution. This is an important point, as it emphasizes the need for companies to focus on restoring the original ecosystem and preserving the biodiversity of the area.
