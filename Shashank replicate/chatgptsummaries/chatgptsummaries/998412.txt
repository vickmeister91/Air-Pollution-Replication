The Andhra High Court received a writ petition from Sirikoti Narayana Rao and two others claiming to be members of the "Kalushya Nivarana Sub-Committee" constituted by A.P. Pollution Control Board. They sought a writ of mandamus for declaring the inaction of respondents 1 to 4 in controlling the dust emanating from stone crushers run by respondents 5 to 10 as illegal and unconstitutional. The petitioners also sought for a consequential direction to respondents 1 to 4 to take necessary steps including closure of the crushers and to see that the medical expenses incurred are reimbursed as compensation to the residents of the colonies which are affected by running of stone crushers by respondents 5 to 10.

The court appointed Sri P.S. Rajashekar and Sri V.V.N. Narsimham, advocates as Court Commissioners authorizing them to visit the site and make an assessment of the pollution caused due to the operation of the stone crushers and also the extent of green belt developed by the stone crushers within 50 meters of their radius.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed against stone crushers in a particular locality. The court had appointed commissioners to inspect the crushers and record statements of residents. The court also directed the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) to conduct an air ambient test. The report submitted by the Environmental Engineer showed that the air pollution caused by individual stone crushers was within prescribed limits. However, the court felt that the cumulative effect of air pollution caused by all the stone crushers needed to be considered.

The court directed the APPCB to constitute a team of doctors to monitor the health conditions of people living in the area and recover medical expenses from the stone crusher owners. The court also directed the stone crusher owners to construct wind breaking walls and lay metal roads and maintain green belts. Failure to comply with the court's directions would result in appropriate action under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981.
