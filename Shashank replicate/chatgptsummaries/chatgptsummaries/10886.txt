The first court order pertains to a Second Appeal arising out of execution proceedings between a landlord and tenant. The suit was filed for recovering arrears of rent and the parties arrived at a compromise in that suit. The compromise decree was passed which provided for payment of arrears of rent by instalments specified therein. The judgment-debtor committed certain defaults, and the decree-holder filed for recovering possession of the suit premises. The judgment-debtor challenged the order passed by the learned Trial Judge in the Court of the District Judge, and the present Second Appeal has been filed by the judgment-debtor.

The court held that the Second Appeal was not maintainable as Section 29(2) of the Bombay Rent Act expressly prohibits second appeals. The court converted the Second Appeal into a Civil Revision Application and proceeded to decide the matter on the basis that it is a Civil Revision Application. The court examined the Civil contentions and found that the learned District Judge had dismissed the appeal without entering into the merits of the case.

The second court order states that the plaintiff is entitled to obtain vacant and actual possession of a shop and godown from the defendant, who is currently in possession, and the defendant must pay compensation for the use of the premises. If the defendant fails to pay the compensation for two months, the plaintiff can take possession of the premises. The court must determine whether the obligation is a penalty or a concession, and relief against forfeiture may be granted if the relationship of landlord and tenant was created or continued by the compromise decree. The court refers to previous decisions on the subject.

The third court order discusses two Full Bench decisions that deal with granting relief to judgment-debtors in different circumstances. The court states that it is up to the executing court to decide which Full Bench decision applies to the case at hand. The court also overrules a previous decision that followed an overruled decision and remands the case to the district judge for a decision on the merits.
