The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Mahendra Agrawal, who had been acquitted of illegal possession of liquor without lawful authority. The trial court had not made any order regarding the seized vehicle, and the appellate court had dismissed Agrawal's appeal as not maintainable since proceedings for confiscation were pending. Agrawal had then filed a criminal revision, challenging the order made by the appellate court.

The court, however, dismissed the revision, stating that Agrawal had failed to make out a case, and the proceedings for confiscation were pending before the concerned authority. The court's decision was based on the fact that Agrawal had not been able to provide any evidence to support his claim that the vehicle in question was not used for the transportation of the liquor that had been seized.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that Agrawal had not been able to provide any evidence to support his claim that he had no knowledge of the liquor that had been seized. The court noted that Agrawal had been driving the vehicle at the time of the seizure, and that he had not denied being in possession of the vehicle or the liquor.

The court also noted that Agrawal had not challenged the order of the trial court, which had not made any order regarding the seized vehicle. The court observed that Agrawal had only challenged the order of the appellate court, which had dismissed his appeal as not maintainable since proceedings for confiscation were pending.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Agrawal had not been able to provide any evidence to support his claim that the proceedings for confiscation were not pending. The court noted that Agrawal had not produced any documents to show that the proceedings for confiscation had been concluded, or that any order had been passed in his favor.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that Agrawal had not been able to provide any evidence to support his claim that the proceedings for confiscation were not valid. The court noted that Agrawal had not challenged the validity of the proceedings for confiscation, and that he had not produced any evidence to show that the proceedings were not in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Mahendra Agrawal, who had been acquitted of illegal possession of liquor without lawful authority. The court dismissed the revision, stating that Agrawal had failed to make out a case, and the proceedings for confiscation were pending before the concerned authority. The court's decision was based on the fact that Agrawal had not been able to provide any evidence to support his claims, and that he had not challenged the orders of the trial court or the validity of the proceedings for confiscation.
