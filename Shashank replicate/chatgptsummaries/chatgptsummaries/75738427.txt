The Gujarat High Court recently heard a civil application for stay in the case of N R Agrawal Industries Ltd vs Sirish B Desai & 2. The case involves a suit for specific performance, declaration, and permanent injunction filed by the applicant, a paper manufacturing company, against the respondents. The applicant is required to obtain necessary permissions and consents to discharge its treated effluents into the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) of GIDC, which is situated 4.5 km away from its manufacturing unit. The applicant entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the respondents to lay down a pipeline to carry out its treated effluents from its manufacturing unit into the CETP. The pipeline was laid down by incurring a huge expenditure, and the applicant paid an amount of Rs.13,00,000/- to respondent No.3. The pipeline is currently in working condition, and treated affluents pass through it to reach the CETP.

However, the court order pertains to a dispute over a pipeline laid down by the applicant on a piece of land. The respondent No.3 claims to be the owner of a part of the land and has demanded an exorbitant amount and threatened to remove the pipeline. The applicant has filed a suit and an application for interim injunction before the learned Trial Court. The court has granted an order of status quo till its returnable date. The applicant has argued that respondent No.3 is not the owner of the land and that the pipeline is in working condition and any stay on it would affect the manufacturing process. The applicant has also paid a sum of Rs. 13,00,000/- to respondent No.3. The court has been requested to continue the order of status quo till the application for temporary injunction is decided by the learned Trial Court.

The court order states that the appeal is maintainable and the stay may be continued under Order 43, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The applicant is willing to compensate for the permissive use of the pipeline, and respondent No.3 has not filed any suit or proceedings to prove their legitimate right on the disputed property. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have no dispute with the applicant, but respondent No.3 has threatened to remove the pipeline. The court has decided to continue the order of status quo until the application is heard and decided by the learned Trial Court on merits.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the laying of a pipeline on a piece of land. The applicant, a paper manufacturing unit, had an MOU with the landowners to lay the pipeline, but a third party claimed ownership of the land and demanded payment. The court examined the evidence and found that the third party did not have clear ownership of the land and had accepted a large sum of money from the applicant for the pipeline. The court ordered the third party to allow the pipeline to remain until the matter is decided in court.

The court order states that the applicant has produced evidence that Rs.13,00,000 has been paid to respondent No.3, which has been admitted by respondent No.3. The pipeline was laid down before 10.01.2017, which is supported by the invoices and tax invoices on record. The court believes that if the interim relief is not granted, irreparable loss will ensue to the applicant. The court has granted an ex parte ad-interim injunction to protect the subject matter of the suit until the application is decided by the learned trial court. The parties have been directed to complete their pleadings by 31st August 2017, and the learned trial court is directed to hear the application and decide the same independently.

Finally, the court order states that all parties can make submissions without being influenced by the fact that the appeal is admitted or any observations made in the order. The parties can present all available contentions before the learned Trial Court in the application Exh:5. The observations made in this order are limited to the present application. The application stands disposed of and the parties will bear their own costs. Direct service is permitted.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute over a pipeline laid down by a paper manufacturing company to carry out its treated effluents from its manufacturing unit into the CETP. The respondent No.3 claims to be the owner of a part of the land and has demanded an exorbitant amount and threatened to remove the pipeline. The court has granted an order of status quo till its returnable date and has decided to continue the order of status quo until the application is heard and decided by the learned Trial Court on merits. The court has also granted an ex parte ad-interim injunction to protect the subject matter of the suit until the application is decided by the learned trial court. The parties have been directed to complete their pleadings by 31st August 2017, and the learned trial court is directed to hear the application and decide the same independently.
