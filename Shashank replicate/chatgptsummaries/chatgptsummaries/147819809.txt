The court order in question pertains to a case where an individual, T. Ilayaperumal, had sought employment as an Industrial Worker/Trainee with Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. in 1978. It was discovered that he had altered his mark sheet to secure a job, and subsequently, his National Trade Certificate was cancelled, and he was dismissed from service. 

The appellant had challenged his dismissal in a writ petition, which was allowed by a learned Single Judge in 1996, but the Supreme Court allowed the appeal in favour of the Corporation in 1997. The issue in this intra-Court appeal was whether the cancellation of the National Trade Certificate could be agitated at this stage. 

The court held that the appellant should have exercised his right to question the validity of the cancellation before the dismissal was confirmed, and therefore, the appeal was dismissed. The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. 

The court noted that the appellant had not challenged the cancellation of his National Trade Certificate before his dismissal was confirmed, and therefore, he could not do so at this stage. The court also observed that the appellant had not produced any evidence to show that the cancellation of his National Trade Certificate was illegal or arbitrary. 

The court further held that the appellant had altered his mark sheet to secure a job, which was a serious offence. The court noted that the appellant had not denied the allegations against him, and therefore, his dismissal was justified. 

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and natural justice principles in employment matters. It also underscores the seriousness of falsifying documents to secure employment. 

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and the law. The court's reasoning was clear and logical, and it was consistent with established legal principles. The court's decision serves as a reminder to employers and employees alike of the importance of following due process and natural justice principles in employment matters.
