The court orders discussed pertain to the import and clearance of taxidermy items, specifically a Panthera Pardus, by the Customs/CITES authorities in India. The petitioner, who had hunted wild animals including leopard in Zambia and subjected them to taxidermy, had applied for importation and clearance of the items in India. However, the authorities denied the application due to violations of the Export-Import policy, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The first court order discusses the various legislations enacted by several countries worldwide to protect the lives of endangered species of animals and birds and curb international trade in live animals/birds or their products. The court also discusses the convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and India's role as a party to CITES. The court ultimately rules that the petitioner is not entitled to clearance of the item of Panthera Pardus due to violations of the aforementioned laws and articles of CITES.

The second court order, on the other hand, found that the rejection of the import application by the CITES authority was without merit as the petitioner had obtained the necessary permits from the appropriate authorities. The court quashed the order of the CITES authority and directed the customs authorities to adjudicate the show cause notice in accordance with the law. The customs authorities were also directed not to withhold clearance of the items on the ground that a permit under CITES was not obtained.

The two court orders seem to be in conflict with each other, with one denying clearance of the taxidermy item and the other directing the customs authorities to clear it. However, a closer look at the details of the cases reveals that the conflict arises due to different interpretations of the laws and regulations governing the import and clearance of taxidermy items.

In the first court order, the petitioner was found to have violated the Export-Import policy, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the articles of CITES. These laws and regulations are in place to protect endangered species from being hunted and traded, and to ensure that their populations are conserved for future generations. The court found that the petitioner's actions were in violation of these laws and regulations, and therefore, the clearance of the taxidermy item was denied.

In the second court order, however, the petitioner had obtained the necessary permits from the appropriate authorities, indicating that the import and clearance of the taxidermy item was legal. The court found that the rejection of the import application by the CITES authority was without merit, as the petitioner had followed the necessary procedures and obtained the required permits. Therefore, the court directed the customs authorities to clear the items in accordance with the law.

The conflict between the two court orders highlights the need for a clear and consistent interpretation of the laws and regulations governing the import and clearance of taxidermy items. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that these laws and regulations are enforced to protect endangered species from being hunted and traded, and to conserve their populations for future generations.
