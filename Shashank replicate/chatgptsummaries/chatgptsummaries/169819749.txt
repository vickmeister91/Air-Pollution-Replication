The court order in question pertains to two criminal original petitions that were filed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. These petitions sought to direct certain persons to produce certain documents. The trial court allowed one of the petitions and dismissed the other. However, the order passed in the allowed petition is confirmed only with regard to one document, while the order passed in the dismissed petition is set aside and the petition is allowed.
