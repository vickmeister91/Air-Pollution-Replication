The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that challenged the order passed by the Additional District Magistrate, Bhubaneswar in Revision Case No.6 of 1997. The order in question had set aside the lease granted in favor of the petitioner by the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar. The petitioner, an ex-serviceman, had applied for a piece of land under the Odisha Government Land Settlement Act, 1962. The land in question was settled to the extent of Ac.1.000 decimals appertaining to Plot No.755 under Khata No.257/36 of Mouza - Shyamsundarpur in favor of the petitioner.

The impugned order was passed on the grounds that the petitioner was not entitled to the land as he was not a native of the revenue village and his annual income was more than the eligible amount. The petitioner had argued that he was entitled to the land as he had served in the Indian Army and was an ex-serviceman. However, the court found no error in the impugned order and dismissed the writ petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner did not meet the eligibility criteria for the land in question. The Odisha Government Land Settlement Act, 1962, provides for the settlement of government land to eligible persons. The eligibility criteria include being a native of the revenue village and having an annual income below a certain amount. The court found that the petitioner did not meet these criteria and therefore was not entitled to the land.

The court's decision highlights the importance of eligibility criteria in the settlement of government land. The government has a responsibility to ensure that land is settled to eligible persons who meet the criteria set out in the law. This ensures that the land is used for its intended purpose and that it benefits those who are most in need of it.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the fact that the petitioner did not meet the eligibility criteria for the land in question. The court found no error in the impugned order and dismissed the writ petition. This decision highlights the importance of eligibility criteria in the settlement of government land and the government's responsibility to ensure that land is settled to eligible persons who meet the criteria set out in the law.
