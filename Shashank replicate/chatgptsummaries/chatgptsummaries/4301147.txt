The Lucky Agencies and The Lucky A.S. Food Products Industries had filed a writ petition to quash an order passed by the Assistant Commissioner/Sub Divisional Magistrate of Bhatkal Division, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka. The petitioners claimed to have obtained all necessary permissions, approvals, and licenses from statutory authorities to establish two industries. However, the Sub Divisional Magistrate initiated proceedings against them under Section 133 of the Cr.P.C. alleging that public nuisance was being created by the industries. The petitioners sought to quash the impugned order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate.

The High Court of Karnataka directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to examine the claim of the petitioners in the light of the memo filed by them on 25.10.2013. The court has allowed the writ petitions and quashed the previous order. The matter is remitted back to the first respondent for consideration afresh on merits in accordance with the law. The fourth respondent is also at liberty to examine whether the terms and conditions stipulated in the consent orders given by them to the petitioners are complied with or not and take steps in accordance with the law. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the claim made in the writ petitions, and all contentions raised by the petitioners are left open.
