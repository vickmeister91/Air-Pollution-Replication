The Orissa High Court recently issued a court order that rejected a batch of writ petitions filed by stone crushing unit owners seeking an alternate site and to quash the notice of closure issued by the State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the petitioners had already challenged the notification issued by the government of Orissa in an earlier writ petition, which was dismissed. However, the court directed the state and/or authorities to provide the petitioners with alternate sites complying with the requirements as stipulated by the State Pollution Control Board within a limited period. 

The court also ordered the closure of all polluting stone crushing units that are operating without complying with the siting criteria and without approval of the State Pollution Control Board. The workmen employed in the stone crushing units shall be entitled to certain rights and benefits. The order applies to all non-compliant stone crushing units in Orissa, and the Industry Secretary must invite applications for relocation. Violations of the order will be viewed seriously and dealt with according to the Contempt of Court's Act.

The court order further states that workmen who have been in continuous service for at least one year in the concerned industries before August 2010 shall be paid compensation and an additional year's wages as compensation. The management must pay the shifting bonus and compensation by September 16, 2010, and gratuity must also be paid.
