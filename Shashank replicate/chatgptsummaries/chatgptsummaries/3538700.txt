The court order pertains to multiple cases involving the transfer, sale, transportation, and management of elephants in the state of Kerala. The court notes the importance of elephants in the state's traditions and rituals and emphasizes the need to protect and conserve wild animals for ecological and environmental security.

In one case, the court heard arguments from both sides regarding the transportation of two male elephants from the states of Assam or Bihar. The court identified four issues for consideration, including whether the sale or purchase of elephants is permissible under Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and whether there is a total prohibition on the transaction of elephants under the statutory scheme. The court also noted various amendments made to the Act and their objects and purposes.

The court ultimately ordered the respondents to issue a No Objection Certificate for the transportation of the elephants and to dispose of a representation made by the petitioner. The court also declared that no previous permission is required for the transfer or transportation of an elephant from the Chief Wild Life Warden.

In another case, the court discussed the provisions of the Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2003 and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The court noted that the purpose of the Act is to protect wildlife and prevent ecological imbalances caused by human activities. The court emphasized the importance of harmoniously construing the provisions of the Act to achieve its purpose and object.

The court also discussed the interpretation and application of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and its amendments, particularly in relation to the trade and transfer of wild animals, including elephants. The court clarified the requirements for prior permission from the Chief Wild Life Warden for the transfer of captive animals, including elephants, and rejected the argument that only a report is necessary. The court cited several cases and provisions of the Act to support its conclusions.

In yet another case, the court held that until the Act is amended, there should be some regulation with regard to sale, transfer, and other dealings involving changing of hands of captive elephants in accordance with the norms prescribed by the Chief Wild Life Warden. The court also clarified that the offense under Section 43 of the Act is not made out if the transfer or transportation is effected with permission under Section 40(2). The court allowed certain writ petitions and dismissed others, directing the respondent to consider an application for transportation of an elephant from the State of Bihar to Thiruvananthapuram.

Overall, the court's orders emphasize the need to protect and conserve elephants and other wild animals in the state of Kerala. The court clarifies the requirements for prior permission for the transfer and transportation of captive animals, and notes the importance of harmoniously construing the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act to achieve its purpose and object.
