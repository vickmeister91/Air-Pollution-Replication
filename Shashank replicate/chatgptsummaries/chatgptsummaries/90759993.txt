The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Rajesh Pal Jadoun seeking protection from being forcefully evicted from his residential house. The eviction notice was issued by the respondents under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner's counsel argued that the authorities had not considered the legal possession of the petitioner and had treated him as an encroacher over forest land.

The petitioner's counsel contended that the petitioner had been in legal possession of the property for several years and had all the necessary documents to prove his ownership. The counsel further argued that the authorities had not followed the due process of law while issuing the eviction notice and had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, granted the respondents two weeks to file a reply to the writ petition. The court also ordered that the petitioner not be forcefully evicted from the premises in the meantime. The court observed that the petitioner had raised serious questions of law and fact, which needed to be examined in detail before any action could be taken.

The court also observed that the eviction notice had been issued under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which was meant to protect wildlife and their habitats. However, the court noted that the Act did not give the authorities the power to evict people from their homes without following the due process of law.

The court further observed that the petitioner had been residing in the property for several years and had made substantial investments in the property. The court noted that the eviction notice had caused immense hardship to the petitioner and his family and had disrupted their lives.
