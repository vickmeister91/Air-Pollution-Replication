The court order pertains to three separate disputes over parking space contracts between S.K. Pandey and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). In the first case, Pandey claimed that he was unable to use the parking space fully due to encroachments and sought arbitration. Pandey raised several claims, including a refund of license fee, loss of profit, and refund of security deposit. MCD disputed these claims and raised its own claims for damages and unpaid rent. The arbitrator found that Pandey was not able to use 40% of the parking space and was entitled to a reduction in the monthly license fee. The court order summarizes the claims and findings of both parties.

In the second case, the dispute was over a parking site contract. The claimant/petitioner was entitled to a 40% reduction in the monthly license fee, but only for the period before the contract ended on August 31, 2002. The respondent counterclaimed for an amount of Rs.1,12,11,056/-, but the arbitrator found no evidence to support this claim and instead levied reasonable damages of Rs.3,51,100/- p.m. The claimant/petitioner was not entitled to interest on the reduced amount. The court will only set aside an arbitrator's award if it is illegal, against the law of the land, or so perverse that it shocks the judicial conscience. The court found that the arbitrator had thoroughly considered all issues and evidence before arriving at the conclusions, and therefore upheld the award.

The third case involved a parking site contract where the petitioner raised objections about obstructions and hindrances in running the site. However, the court found that the claims were not within the ambit of the agreement and were belied by material documents. The court dismissed the objections and ordered the petitioner to pay further license fees to the respondent MCD.

In all three cases, the court emphasized the limited scope of its review of an arbitrator's award. The court cannot reappreciate material on the record or substitute its own view in place of that of the arbitrator. The court will only set aside an award if it is illegal, against the law of the land, or so perverse that it shocks the judicial conscience. In the first case, the court found that the arbitrator had considered all issues and evidence before arriving at the conclusions. In the second case, the court upheld the award because the arbitrator had thoroughly considered all issues and evidence before arriving at the conclusions. In the third case, the court dismissed the objections because they were not within the ambit of the agreement and were belied by material documents.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of arbitration in resolving disputes between parties. It emphasizes the limited scope of judicial review of an arbitrator's award and the need for parties to carefully consider the terms of their agreements before entering into them. The court's decisions in these cases provide guidance for future disputes over parking space contracts and other similar agreements.
