The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board has been in the news recently due to a court order pertaining to a challenge by M/s Hotel Royal India against a notice issued by the board. The court had directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable, and to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The petitioner filed the affidavit as directed by the court.

In another court order, a writ petition was filed by a petitioner who had raised construction beyond the sanctioned plan, which was almost 700% more than the allowed limit. The court noticed that several similar petitions were filed, and all of them had a common thread of violating municipal laws. The petitioner sought permission to withdraw the writ petition, which was allowed subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposed of the writ petition as having been withdrawn.

The court order pertaining to M/s Hotel Royal India is significant as it highlights the importance of complying with all statutory rules and regulations while carrying out construction activities. The court's direction to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable, and to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws is a clear indication that the court takes such matters seriously.

The court's order also serves as a reminder to all construction companies and individuals to ensure that they comply with all statutory rules and regulations while carrying out construction activities. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them, which can be both time-consuming and costly.

The court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by the petitioner who had raised construction beyond the sanctioned plan is also significant. The fact that several similar petitions were filed, and all of them had a common thread of violating municipal laws, highlights the need for stricter enforcement of such laws.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority is a clear indication that the court takes such matters seriously. It also serves as a warning to others who may be considering violating municipal laws while carrying out construction activities.

In conclusion, the court orders pertaining to M/s Hotel Royal India and the writ petition filed by the petitioner who had raised construction beyond the sanctioned plan highlight the importance of complying with all statutory rules and regulations while carrying out construction activities. They also serve as a reminder to all construction companies and individuals to ensure that they comply with all such rules and regulations to avoid legal action being taken against them. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority is a clear indication that the court takes such matters seriously and will not hesitate to take action against those who violate municipal laws.
