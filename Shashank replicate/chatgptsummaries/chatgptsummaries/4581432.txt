The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner is facing trial under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The trial court had allowed the production of a certified copy of a judgment in a civil suit, which the petitioner objected to as it was not part of the record. The petitioner had approached the High Court seeking to set aside the trial court's order.

The High Court observed that the trial court had the power to permit the production of any document necessary for the just trial of the case. The court noted that the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that any document may be produced in evidence if it is relevant to the matter in issue and is not excluded by any provision of the Act. The court further noted that the Act does not require a document to be part of the record to be admissible in evidence.

The High Court also observed that the petitioner could challenge the admissibility, relevance, and mode of proof of the document during the final arguments. The court noted that the petitioner had not challenged the authenticity of the document and that the trial court had taken note of the fact that the document was a certified copy.

The court held that the trial court had not committed any error in allowing the production of the document and that the petitioner's objection was without merit. The court further held that the petitioner could challenge the admissibility, relevance, and mode of proof of the document during the final arguments.

The petition was disposed of, and the parties were directed to appear before the trial court. The trial court was directed to proceed with the trial in accordance with law and to decide the case on its merits.

In conclusion, the High Court upheld the trial court's order allowing the production of a certified copy of a judgment in a civil suit. The court held that the trial court had the power to permit the production of any document necessary for the just trial of the case and that the petitioner could challenge the admissibility, relevance, and mode of proof of the document during the final arguments. The court directed the parties to appear before the trial court and to proceed with the trial in accordance with law.
