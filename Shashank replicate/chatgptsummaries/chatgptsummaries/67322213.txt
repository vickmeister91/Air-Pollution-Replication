The National Green Tribunal received an application from Kamta Saini requesting the cancellation of a pre-consent granted to Jaiswani Petrol Pump by the MP Pollution Control Board for the establishment of a petrol pump on land adjacent to the Adhartal Tank in Jabalpur. The applicant argued that the petrol pump would pollute the water in the tank. The MP Pollution Control Board conducted an inspection and concluded that the petrol pump would not cause pollution. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. also submitted a reply stating that the petrol pump was only a fuel filling station and not a service station, and therefore, would not generate hazardous waste that could flow into the Adhartal Tank.

The court order states that a fuel filling station has been granted a license for installation, but not for a petrol pump with a service station. The court finds that no permission under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and its rules was required since there would be zero discharge of water and effluent and no waste would be generated on account of this limited activity of fuel filling station. The court also finds that the permission granted by the MP Pollution Control Board under the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 is comprehensive enough. The application is dismissed with no order as to costs.
