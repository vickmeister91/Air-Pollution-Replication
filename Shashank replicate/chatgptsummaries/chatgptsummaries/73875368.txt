The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by the State of Rajasthan against Sundar Lal and others. The petition challenges an order passed by the Board of Revenue in 2003, which upheld an order passed by the Revenue Appellate Authority in 2002. The order cancelled the allotment of land made in favor of various persons by an order dated 15/12/2001. The land in question was declared a protected forest in 1986, but due to a printing mistake, the details of the land were not published correctly. The land was allotted to private cultivators in 2000, and the Forest Department was not notified of these proceedings.

The State of Rajasthan, through the Forest Department, filed a writ petition challenging the order of the Board of Revenue. The petition argued that the land in question was a protected forest and could not be allotted to private cultivators. The petition also argued that the Forest Department was not notified of the allotment proceedings, which was a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and observed that the land in question was indeed a protected forest. The court noted that the land was declared a protected forest in 1986, and the notification was published in the Rajasthan Gazette. However, due to a printing mistake, the details of the land were not published correctly. The court observed that this mistake was not the fault of the Forest Department and that the land continued to be a protected forest.

The court also observed that the allotment of land to private cultivators was done without notifying the Forest Department, which was a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court noted that the Act required that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes should be done with the prior approval of the Central Government. The court observed that the allotment of land to private cultivators was a diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes and should have been done with the prior approval of the Central Government.

The court, therefore, upheld the order of the Board of Revenue and cancelled the allotment of land made in favor of various persons by an order dated 15/12/2001. The court granted the State of Rajasthan through the Forest Department the liberty to move a review petition before the Board of Revenue with appropriate application and relevant documents.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the State of Rajasthan against Sundar Lal and others. The court upheld the order of the Board of Revenue and cancelled the allotment of land made in favor of various persons by an order dated 15/12/2001. The court observed that the land in question was a protected forest and that the allotment of land to private cultivators was done without notifying the Forest Department, which was a violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court granted the State of Rajasthan through the Forest Department the liberty to move a review petition before the Board of Revenue with appropriate application and relevant documents. The writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn.
