The Church of God (Full Gospel) filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court, requesting a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for records relating to the order of the second respondent in his letter dated 22.3.2001 and the order passed by the first respondent in G.O.(D) No.594, Housing-cum-Municipal Administration Department dated 23.7.2002 to quash the same and to direct the second respondent to consider the petitioner's application for regularisation dated 29.5.2001. The petitioner is a registered society under the provisions of Societies Registration Act, 1860, and is engaged in establishing Health Care Centres throughout Tamil Nadu and had established 215 Churches in Tamil Nadu. The property in question of an extent of 31295 sq. ft. in plot No.8 4, KKR Majestic Colony was purchased on 16.9.1994. The area falls within industrial and residential area, and the Church established thereunder has been functioning from 1995. The petitioner contends that they have not violated the permissible noise level till date and that the prayer meetings are being carried on Sundays between 8.30 A.M. and 12.30 P.M. and there has been no complaint either from the Pollution Control Board, local people or police authorities.

The court order discusses a dispute over the regularisation of a prayer hall in a residential area. The petitioner argues that the respondents' actions were motivated by religious extremism and that the proceedings related only to noise pollution control. The court finds that the only issue dealt with in previous criminal proceedings was noise pollution and that the petitioner was only directed to lower the noise level and comply with noise pollution regulations. The court also notes that the refusal to grant regularisation on the grounds of noise pollution was a welcome measure, but that town planning authorities should not feel restricted only to provisions relating to town and country planning or municipal laws.

The court ultimately rules that the town planning authorities cannot reject the application for regularisation on the grounds of noise pollution and that the rules made under an act cannot go beyond or overstep the limits of the parent act itself. The court order states that the Act in question is concerned only with developmental activities and does not give the authority the power to deal with issues outside of its jurisdiction. The court also cautions religious enthusiasts to practice their faith in a cultured way and not to resort to aggressive or unfair methods.

The court allows the writ petition subject to certain observations and closes connected WPMP Nos.51405 and 51406 of 2002.

The court's ruling is significant as it clarifies the limits of the town planning authorities' power and ensures that they cannot reject applications for regularisation on the grounds of noise pollution alone.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of adhering to the provisions of the parent act and not overstepping its limits. The court's caution to religious enthusiasts to practice their faith in a cultured way and not
