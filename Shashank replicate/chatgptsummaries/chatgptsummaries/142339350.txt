The court order in question pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Suman Kumari against the State of Bihar and others. The petitioner had sought relief in quashing an order passed in Service Appeal No. 215 of 2009, which had set aside the cancellation of selection of respondent No. 9 as Anganwari Sevika for Center No. 111. The petitioner was subsequently selected for the same center. 

The court considered the fact that the petitioner's selection was subject to the result of the proceedings pending against respondent No. 9 and that no opportunity was given to the petitioner prior to the cancellation of her selection. The court held that the cancellation of respondent No. 9's selection was unjust and that interference with the order passed by the Collector would result in reviving an illegal order. The court dismissed the writ petition.
