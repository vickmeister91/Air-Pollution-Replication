The Kerala High Court recently passed a ruling on a writ petition filed by Renjith C.R. and Daisy against the State of Kerala and other authorities regarding an order passed by the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011. The petitioners had sought consideration of a proposal made by the State Government for exemption from certain conditions in the notification. However, the court ruled that the State Government's proposal alone cannot empower the State to consider such a request for exemption unless it is sanctioned by the Central Government.

The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The notification aims to regulate activities in the coastal zone, which is defined as the area between the high tide line and 500 meters inland. The notification lays down various conditions for activities such as construction, mining, and tourism in the coastal zone, with the aim of protecting the environment and the livelihoods of coastal communities.

The State Government had proposed certain amendments to the notification, including exemptions for certain activities from the conditions laid down in the notification. The petitioners had sought consideration of these proposals by the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority. However, the Authority had rejected the proposals, stating that they were not in accordance with the notification and that the State Government did not have the power to grant exemptions.

The petitioners had then approached the High Court, seeking a direction to the Authority to consider their proposals. They had argued that the State Government had the power to grant exemptions under the notification, and that the proposals were in accordance with the notification.

However, the High Court rejected their arguments and dismissed the writ petition. The court held that the State Government's proposal alone cannot empower the State to consider such a request for exemption unless it is sanctioned by the Central Government. The court also observed that the notification was a Central legislation, and that any amendments or exemptions to it could only be made by the Central Government.

The court's ruling has significant implications for the regulation of activities in the coastal zone in Kerala. It clarifies that the State Government does not have the power to grant exemptions under the notification, and that any proposals for amendments or exemptions must be sanctioned by the Central Government. This ensures that the notification is implemented uniformly across the country, and that the environmental and livelihood concerns of coastal communities are protected.

The court's ruling also highlights the importance of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, in protecting the coastal environment and the livelihoods of coastal communities. The notification lays down various conditions for activities in the coastal zone, with the aim of balancing development and environmental concerns. The notification has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some arguing that it is too restrictive and hinders development, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the fragile coastal ecosystem.

Overall, the court's ruling is a significant development in the regulation of activities in the coastal zone in Kerala, and underscores the importance of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, in protecting the environment and the livelihoods of coastal communities.
