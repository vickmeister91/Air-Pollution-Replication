In a recent court order, the petitioner Bhimappa B Jadav filed a petition against the Union of India, Department of Forest and Environment, and other respondents. The petitioner sought to prevent mining activities in a forest area measuring 348.35 acres in Dummawad village, Taluk: Kalghatagi, without prior approval from the Central Government as required under Section 2(ii) of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect forests and wildlife in India.

The petitioner argued that the mining activities in the forest area would have a detrimental impact on the environment and wildlife in the area. The petitioner also argued that the mining activities would violate the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, as the mining company had not obtained the necessary approvals from the Central Government.

The court directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's representation and take suitable steps to preserve the forest area. The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting forests and wildlife in India. The court's order also emphasizes the need for companies to obtain the necessary approvals before carrying out any activities that may have an impact on the environment.
