The Gujarat High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Hussain Salemamad Kara against the Gujarat State Level Environment-Impact Assessment Authority and OPG Power Gujarat Pvt. Ltd. The petitioner sought a direction to cancel the Environment Clearance granted to the 3rd respondent for breach of the Environment Clearance dated 11.6.2010. 

The court noted that the Government of India had already issued a show cause notice under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 alleging violation of the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and asked the 3rd respondent to file a reply. The court disposed of the writ petition, stating that no opinion was required to be expressed at this stage as the Government of India was supposed to decide the matter on merit after receipt of the show cause reply.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental clearance and the need to adhere to the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification. The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition without expressing an opinion indicates that it is important to allow the Government of India to decide the matter on merit after receiving the show cause reply.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a crucial legislation that aims to protect and improve the quality of the environment and prevent hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants and property. The Act empowers the central government to take measures to protect and improve the environment, and also provides for the establishment of authorities to regulate and enforce environmental standards.

The Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 is another important legislation that aims to assess the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects or activities and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate any adverse impacts. The notification requires that all projects or activities listed in the Schedule I of the notification undergo an environmental impact assessment and obtain environmental clearance from the relevant authorities before commencing operations.

In the present case, the petitioner had alleged that the 3rd respondent had breached the Environment Clearance dated 11.6.2010. The court noted that the Government of India had already issued a show cause notice under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 alleging violation of the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and asked the 3rd respondent to file a reply.

Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 empowers the central government to issue directions to any person, officer or authority to take measures to prevent or mitigate environmental pollution. The show cause notice issued by the Government of India under Section 5 indicates that it is taking the matter seriously and is willing to take appropriate action to ensure that environmental standards are upheld.

The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition without expressing an opinion indicates that it is important to allow the Government of India to decide the matter on merit after receiving the show cause reply. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given an opportunity to be heard before a decision is made.

In conclusion, the court order in the present case highlights the importance of environmental clearance and the need to adhere to the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification. The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition without expressing an opinion indicates that it is important to allow the Government of India to decide the matter on merit after receiving the show cause reply. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and underscores the importance of upholding environmental standards to protect and improve the quality of the environment.
