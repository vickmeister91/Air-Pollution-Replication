The court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Satbir Singh against an order allowing Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi to withdraw as a witness in a criminal complaint filed against Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi, Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, and Arvind Kejriwal. The complaint alleges that these individuals conspired to defame and bring disrepute to the government of India and its officials. 

The court notes that the order in question is interlocutory and questions the maintainability of the revision. The court cites legal precedent to support the idea that orders of an interlocutory nature are not amenable to challenge in a revision. The court discusses two previous cases where the term "interlocutory order" was defined as not including orders that substantially affect the rights of the accused or adjudicate certain rights of the parties. 

The court then applies this definition to the case at hand, where the dropping of a witness was challenged in a revision. The court finds that the dropping of the witness was an interlocutory order and therefore not challengeable in the revision. The court also notes that the witness was not originally listed and that the revisionist did not need to insist on their personal appearance. 

The court ultimately disposes of the revision as not maintainable. This decision highlights the importance of understanding the nature of court orders and the limitations on challenging them. Interlocutory orders, which are orders made during the course of a legal proceeding that do not finally determine the rights of the parties, are generally not subject to challenge in a revision. 

This case also underscores the importance of careful consideration when listing witnesses in a criminal complaint. The dropping of a witness can have significant implications for the case, and parties should be mindful of the potential consequences when making such decisions. 

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the complexities of the legal system and the importance of understanding the nuances of court orders and legal procedures. It also highlights the need for careful consideration and strategic decision-making in legal proceedings.
