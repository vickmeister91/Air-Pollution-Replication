The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner is facing trial for offences under Section 376 (2) (N), 366, and 313 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking the call details of the prosecutrix and the applicant/Raja Soni. However, the trial court had disallowed the application stating that the prosecutrix had admitted to living with the accused as his wife. The High Court dismissed the petition in light of the trial court's order.

The case in question involves serious allegations of sexual assault and other offences against the petitioner. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking the call details of the prosecutrix and the applicant/Raja Soni. This application was disallowed by the trial court on the grounds that the prosecutrix had admitted to living with the accused as his wife.

The petitioner had argued that the call details were necessary to establish the nature of the relationship between the prosecutrix and the accused. However, the trial court had rejected this argument, stating that the admission by the prosecutrix that she had lived with the accused as his wife was sufficient to establish the nature of the relationship between the two.

The High Court, in dismissing the petition, upheld the trial court's order. The court noted that the trial court had correctly applied the law in disallowing the application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish any grounds for challenging the trial court's order.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of establishing the nature of the relationship between the accused and the prosecutrix in cases of sexual assault and other offences. In cases where the prosecutrix has admitted to living with the accused as his wife, it may be difficult to establish that the accused had committed any offence against her.

However, it is important to note that the admission by the prosecutrix that she had lived with the accused as his wife does not necessarily mean that the accused is innocent of the charges against him. It is still possible for the accused to have committed offences against the prosecutrix, even if they were in a consensual relationship.

In cases where the nature of the relationship between the accused and the prosecutrix is in question, it may be necessary to gather additional evidence to establish the facts of the case. This may include call details, witness statements, and other forms of evidence.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the importance of establishing the facts of a case in order to arrive at a just and fair verdict. While the admission by the prosecutrix that she had lived with the accused as his wife may be a significant factor in determining the nature of the relationship between the two, it is not necessarily determinative of the accused's guilt or innocence. Additional evidence may be necessary to arrive at a just and fair verdict in cases of sexual assault and other offences.
