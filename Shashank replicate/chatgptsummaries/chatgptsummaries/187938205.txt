The first court order pertains to a case where the petitioner was given an appointment on a post allowing higher pay scale under "The Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servants Dying In Harness Rules, 1974". Initially, the petitioner was offered the post of Untrained Veterinary Pharmacist, but was later offered the post of Junior Clerk in the same department. The petitioner argued that the order offering the Junior Clerk post was violative of principles of natural justice. However, the court found that the post of Untrained Veterinary Pharmacist did not exist and the petitioner did not possess the minimum qualifications required for the post. The court also found that the respondents had offered a post with a higher pay scale to the petitioner and had followed the rules and regulations applicable to the case. The court held that the action of the respondents was legally sustainable and did not find any legal infirmity in their action.

The second court order discusses the principle that not only must there be a violation of natural justice, but there must also be de facto prejudice in order to prove a case. The court also states that if the quashing of an order that violates natural justice is likely to result in the revival of another illegal order, it is not necessary to quash the order. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition, but grants the petitioner the liberty to accept appointment under Annexure-1 within 45 days.
