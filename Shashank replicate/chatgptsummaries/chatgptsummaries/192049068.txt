The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Girish Seksaria against the State of Karnataka. The appellant had been acquitted of offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, but the court had ordered the absolute custody of seized properties (MO's.1 to 17) to be given to the Forest Department. The appellant had appealed against this order, claiming that the seized ivory articles should have been returned to him. However, the court held that the properties cannot be returned to the accused as they are the properties of the State under Section 39 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the appellant had been acquitted of offences under the Act, but the court had ordered the absolute custody of seized properties to be given to the Forest Department. The seized properties in question were ivory articles, which the appellant claimed should have been returned to him. However, the court held that the properties cannot be returned to the accused as they are the properties of the State under Section 39 of the Act.

Section 39 of the Act provides that any wild animal, bird, or plant, or any part or derivative thereof, which is found in contravention of the Act, shall be the property of the State. The section further provides that the State may dispose of such property in such manner as it thinks fit, subject to any rules that may be made in this behalf.

In this case, the seized ivory articles were found in contravention of the Act, and therefore, they were the property of the State under Section 39. The court held that the properties cannot be returned to the accused as they are the properties of the State, and the State has the power to dispose of them in such manner as it thinks fit.
