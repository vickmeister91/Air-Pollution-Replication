The court has granted bail to Murli Singh, who was accused of administering poisonous medicines to a peacock under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court considered it a fit case for bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. as no recovery was made from him. Singh was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000 and two sureties of Rs.10,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court and appear before it on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Murli Singh was accused of administering poisonous medicines to a peacock, which is a protected species under the Act. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, and also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal or its parts. The Act also provides for penalties for contravention of its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

The court considered the fact that no recovery was made from Singh, and therefore, granted him bail. Bail is a legal provision that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused person will appear before the court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. Bail is also granted on the condition that the accused person will not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

In this case, Singh was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000 and two sureties of Rs.10,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court. A personal bond is a legal document that binds the accused person to appear before the court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. A surety is a person who undertakes to ensure that the accused person will appear before the court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. The surety is required to furnish a sum of money as security.

The court's decision to grant bail to Singh is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court has considered the facts and circumstances of the case and has granted bail on the basis of these considerations.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Murli Singh, who was accused of administering poisonous medicines to a peacock under Sections 9, 39, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court considered it a fit case for bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. as no recovery was made from him. Singh was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000 and two sureties of Rs.10,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court and appear before it on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. The court's decision to grant bail is in line with the principles of natural justice and the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.
