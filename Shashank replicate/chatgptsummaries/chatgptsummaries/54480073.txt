The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by Amaresh Ku Jayaswal under section 17 of the Orissa Special Courts Act, 2006 against the order passed by the Authorized Officer, Special Court, Cuttack in Confiscation Case No.08 of 2012. The appellant had filed a petition for the production of National Sample Survey Organization reports from the year 1987-88 to 2002 from the Directorate of Statistics for the purpose of further cross-examination of P.W.1. The petition was rejected by the Authorized Officer on the ground that the prosecution cannot be compelled to produce documents.

The appellant's counsel contended that the reports are public documents and are available on the website. The court allowed the appellant to file the true copies of the National Sample Survey Reports for the relevant years before the learned Authorized Officer with a memo indicating the source from which he obtained the same. The reports can be marked as exhibit from the side of the appellant and then the learned Authorized Officer shall permit the appellant to put questions to P.W.1 on such reports vis-a-vis the report which has been prepared by P.W.1 and marked as Ext.2.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of fairness in legal proceedings. The appellant had requested the production of documents that he believed would be relevant to his case, and the court has allowed him to present those documents as evidence. This decision ensures that both parties have access to all relevant information and can present their case in the most effective manner possible.

Furthermore, the court's decision also highlights the importance of public documents and their accessibility. The appellant's counsel argued that the National Sample Survey Reports are public documents and are available on the website. The court's decision to allow the appellant to file true copies of these reports reinforces the idea that public documents should be easily accessible to all.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for the legal system in India. It ensures that both parties have access to all relevant information and can present their case in the most effective manner possible. Additionally, it reinforces the importance of public documents and their accessibility.
