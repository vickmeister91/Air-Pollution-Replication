The City & Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) is currently challenging an order to issue witness summons to produce documents in a complaint filed by Bhausaheb Abasaheb Hiwale against eight accused persons, including CIDCO officers. Hiwale has made allegations in respect of certain property and requested action against those accused persons for having committed offences punishable under Sections 420, 409, 464, 465, 468 and 471 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. CIDCO is arguing that the magistrate was not empowered to take cognizance of the complaint in the absence of sanction from the government as contemplated under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by the original complainant under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for production of certain documents. The learned Magistrate has decided to inquire into the allegations made in the complaint by himself and examined the complainant. The court has directed the Chief Administrative Officer to produce certain documents before the court, but in view of Sub-Section (2) of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate ought to have exempted attendance of the said Applicant. The Applicant is not an accused in Regular Criminal Case No.1476 of 2004, and the original accused persons may challenge the order of issuance of process if passed by the Magistrate by raising various grounds, including the ground of sanction as provided under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order states that the applicant does not have the right to seek the quashment of the complaint filed by the original complainant. The applicant had not objected to the order passed by the magistrate and had sought time for the production of documents. The order passed by the magistrate is modified to allow the applicant to produce the documents through a concerned officer, and the attendance of the applicant is exempted. The rest of the order stands confirmed.
