The Patna High Court has issued an order for Bitu Kumar to surrender within four weeks for running a stone crusher machine without a proper license. The court found that Kumar's actions had caused a loss of revenue under various acts. However, the court has also granted Kumar anticipatory bail upon his surrender and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 20,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The conditions laid down under Section 438(2) Cr.P.C. will apply.

The court's decision comes after an investigation into Kumar's activities revealed that he had been operating a stone crusher machine without the necessary license. This had resulted in a loss of revenue for the government under various acts. The court found that Kumar's actions were in violation of the law and ordered him to surrender within four weeks.

However, the court also granted Kumar anticipatory bail upon his surrender and furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 20,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. This means that Kumar will not be immediately taken into custody upon surrendering, but will instead be released on bail. The conditions laid down under Section 438(2) Cr.P.C. will apply, which include that Kumar must not commit any offense while on bail and must cooperate with the investigation.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Kumar is significant, as it shows that the court is willing to consider the circumstances of the case and the individual's background before making a decision. In this case, the court may have taken into account Kumar's lack of prior criminal record and his willingness to cooperate with the investigation.

Overall, the court's order for Kumar to surrender within four weeks for running a stone crusher machine without a proper license is a reminder that individuals must comply with the law and obtain the necessary licenses before engaging in certain activities. However, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Kumar also shows that the court is willing to consider the individual's circumstances before making a decision.
