In a recent court order, Mahesh Pal was acquitted of the offense of driving in the first lane along with the divider, which violated the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in M C Mehta vs Union of India and Ors. The prosecution had to prove that the accused was driving in the first lane near the divider, but the court found insufficient evidence to support the charge. The court discussed the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard, which included prohibiting heavy and medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles from operating on the roads of NCR and NCT, Delhi unless they are fitted with suitable speed control devices to ensure that they do not exceed the speed limit of 40 KMPH. Buses are also confined to the bus lane and are only allowed to halt at designated bus stops. Any breach of these directions could entail suspension/cancellation of the permit and impounding of the vehicle.

The court order also stated that transport vehicles must carry a proper authorization card for the driver and display it in a conspicuous place. In this case, the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offense of driving in the first lane along with the divider. The witnesses produced by the prosecution were police officials and their testimonies suffered from inconsistencies and contradictions. No independent witness was joined in the investigation, which casts doubt on the prosecution's case. The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused is acquitted of the offenses punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act.
