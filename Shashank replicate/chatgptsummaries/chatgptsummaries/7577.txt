The Andhra High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by residents of Krishnapuri Colony, West Nehru Nagar, Secunderabad, regarding the construction of an unauthorized multi-storied complex by M/s. Kartik Constructions. The petitioners alleged that the construction lacked septic tanks, leading to raw faecal matter being let into an open rainwater drain, causing foul odour and health hazards. The petitioners also claimed that the construction caused a desperate water situation and garbage pollution. The court appointed an Expert Committee to inspect the buildings in the vicinity and submit a report on violations and illegal constructions.

The court order pertains to the violation of building regulations in Krishnapuri Colony, Secunderabad. The party in question had permission to construct a stilt floor for parking and a ground floor for residential plots, but they constructed stilt + ground + 2 upper floors, with a carpet area of 7828.78 sq.ft. instead of the permitted 4/32 sq.ft. They also violated setbacks and constructed 24 flats instead of the approved 10. The Expert Committee appointed by the court found that all constructions in the area were in violation of sanctioned plans and bye-laws. The Cantonment Board did not provide apartment-wise dustbins for garbage collection, and some buildings did not have septic tanks. The Executive Officer of the Cantonment Board had issued notices to the party to remove the unauthorized construction, and the Board assured the court that they would comply with any directions given. The court cited relevant sections of the Cantonment Act dealing with illegal erection and re-erection, power to stop erection or re-erection, and projections and obstructions.

The court order discusses the obligations of the Cantonment Board towards its citizens, including providing amenities and taking steps to prevent health hazards and pollution. The court also mentions the duty of the Board to take action against those who cause nuisance to the public. The court cites various judicial precedents to support the idea that public-spirited individuals or organizations can challenge the actions of authorities who fail to discharge their duties and obligations. The court also emphasizes the importance of maintaining ecological balance and the duty of Municipal Authorities to act as trustees and ensure that open spaces are not converted into shopping complexes. The court concludes that public interest litigation is maintainable if anything endangers or impairs the quality of life in derogation of laws.

The Supreme Court of India has ruled that public interest litigation can be used to address issues that endanger or impair the quality of life in violation of laws. However, the court cautioned that such litigation should not be used to settle personal grudges or enmities. The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and the right to live, as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court held that citizens have the right to sue in matters related to environmental protection and that the government has an obligation to safeguard the environment. The court also noted that the right to a clean environment is a basic human right and that the neglect of environmental protection is an invitation to disaster. The court further stated that equity jurisprudence is based on hardship, accident, trust, and fraud, and that the burden of proof is on the authorities to demonstrate that they have taken measures to control pollution. The court also cited several British court decisions that support the right of citizens to bring legal action to prevent abuses of power.

The court order discusses the principle of locus standi, which allows citizens to challenge state action or inaction of public authorities if they have a good ground for supposing that the government is transgressing the law. The court has the power and duty to weigh the public interest of justice to litigants against the public interest asserted by the public authority contrary to its actual conduct. The court also emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and the right to life, which includes the right to a quality environment. The court orders the Executive Officer of the Cantonment Board to take action against a builder who violated the sanctioned plan and did not provide adequate civic amenities. The flat owners whose flats will be subjected to demolition are entitled to make a claim against the builder for the loss incurred by them.

In summary, the court order pertains to the violation of building regulations in Krishnapuri Colony, Secunderabad, where a party had permission to construct a stilt floor for parking and a ground floor for residential plots, but they constructed stilt + ground + 2 upper floors, with a carpet area of 7828.78 sq.ft. instead of the permitted 4/32 sq.ft.
