The Madras High Court recently set aside an order issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to close a decorticating unit owned by Gunavathi Proprietrix. The TNPCB had issued the order due to a lack of proper air pollution control measures and frequent complaints from the public. However, the court found that the petitioner had been in business for 21 years, had registered as a small-scale industry, and had been exempted from the purview of the Pollution Act. The court directed the Board to restore power to the unit and issue a show cause notice to the petitioner before taking any further action.

The case was heard by Justice S. Vaidyanathan, who noted that the petitioner had been running the decorticating unit for over two decades and had been registered as a small-scale industry with the District Industries Centre. The petitioner had also obtained a no-objection certificate from the TNPCB in 2005, which allowed her to operate the unit. However, in 2019, the TNPCB received several complaints from the public regarding air pollution caused by the unit. The Board conducted an inspection and found that the unit did not have proper air pollution control measures in place. As a result, the TNPCB issued an order to close the unit.

The petitioner challenged the order in the Madras High Court, arguing that she had been exempted from the purview of the Pollution Act as a small-scale industry. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Act and found that the petitioner was indeed exempted from certain provisions of the Act. The court also noted that the petitioner had been running the unit for over two decades without any major incidents and that the TNPCB had not given her an opportunity to be heard before issuing the closure order.

The court directed the TNPCB to restore power to the unit and issue a show cause notice to the petitioner before taking any further action. The court also directed the petitioner to install proper air pollution control measures within three months. The court noted that the petitioner had already taken some steps to address the issue and that she had expressed her willingness to comply with the TNPCB's requirements.

The court's decision has been welcomed by small-scale industries in Tamil Nadu, who have been facing increasing scrutiny from the TNPCB in recent years. Many small-scale industries have complained that the TNPCB's regulations are too strict and that they are being unfairly targeted. The court's decision in this case is seen as a victory for small-scale industries and a reminder to regulatory authorities to follow due process before taking any action against them.

Overall, the Madras High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the needs of small-scale industries. While it is important to ensure that industries comply with environmental regulations, it is also important to recognize the contributions of small-scale industries to the economy and to provide them with a fair and transparent regulatory framework. The court's decision in this case is a step in the right direction towards achieving this balance.
