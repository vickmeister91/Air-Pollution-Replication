In a recent court order, the petitioner, Shivendra Dhakre, filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, after his application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. read with Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act was rejected by the trial court. The petitioner sought bank statements, PAN card, address proof, and income tax returns of the complainant, who had filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The complainant had admitted to granting a loan of Rs. 86 lacs to the petitioner, but the date was not mentioned in the complaint, and he showed ignorance about mentioning the loan in his income tax returns. The petitioner argued that the documents he sought were necessary to establish his innocence and confront the complainant. The court allowed the petitioner's application and remanded the matter back to the trial court for consequential follow-up action to summon the documents and afford the petitioner an opportunity to confront the complainant with the aid of those documents.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the documents requested by the petitioner were relevant to the case and could help establish his innocence. The court also noted that the complainant had admitted to granting the loan but had not provided any evidence to support his claim. Therefore, the court found it necessary to allow the petitioner to access the documents he had requested.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of evidence in criminal cases. The court recognized that the documents requested by the petitioner were crucial to his defense and could help him prove his innocence. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in legal proceedings.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of the right to confront one's accuser. The petitioner argued that he needed the documents to confront the complainant and establish his innocence. The court recognized the importance of this right and allowed the petitioner to access the documents he had requested.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is significant as it emphasizes the importance of evidence, transparency, and accountability in legal proceedings. The court recognized the petitioner's right to access the documents he had requested and allowed him to confront his accuser with the aid of those documents. This decision is a positive step towards ensuring justice and fairness in criminal cases.
