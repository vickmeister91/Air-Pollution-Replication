The court order pertains to several cases filed under the Motor Vehicles Act, where petitioners sought compensation for the death of their loved ones in road accidents. In the first case, Uma Shukla and her sons filed a case against Mukand Singh, Anil Yadav, and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. for compensation for the death of Krishna Chandra Shukla in a road accident. The court heard arguments from both sides and found that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of Mukand Singh, who was driving a bus owned by Anil Yadav and insured by ICICI Lombard. The court ordered the respondents to pay compensation to the petitioners.

In the second case, the court order states that in a petition under the Motor Vehicles Act, the petitioner must establish rash and negligent driving, but technicalities are not necessary. The court must simply quantify compensation based on the evidence presented. In this case, the court found that the deceased was killed due to the negligence of the bus driver and awarded compensation based on the deceased's age, earning capacity, and other liabilities. The court used the multiplier method to calculate the compensation. The deceased was earning Rs. 12,000 per month and receiving a pension of Rs. 9,687 per month, and the family was receiving a pension of Rs. 21,000 per month.

In the third case, the court order pertains to a case where the petitioner's husband died in a road accident. The court has awarded compensation to the petitioner for loss of dependency, love and affection, loss of consortium, funeral expenses, and loss of estate. The court has calculated the compensation based on the deceased's income and age, and has also taken into account legal precedents. The primary liability to compensate the petitioner remains with the driver of the offending vehicle, and the owner of the vehicle is also vicariously liable.

In the fourth case, the court order states that since the offending vehicle was owned by respondent no. 2, he is vicariously liable to compensate the petitioners. The vehicle was insured with respondent no. 3, making them contractually liable to compensate the petitioners. The court considered the submissions of both parties and found that the driving license of respondent no. 1 was fake, but respondent no. 2 had checked his license before employing him and had no knowledge that it was fake. The court cited previous cases to explain that the owner is not expected to find out whether the license has been issued by a competent authority or not if it looks genuine on the face of it. The court also stated that the breach of policy conditions, such as a fake or invalid driving license, is not a defense available to the insured against the third parties.

In the fifth case, the court found that the owner of a vehicle was not liable for an accident caused by an unauthorized driver, but the insurance company was liable to pay compensation to the victims. The court also found that the driver was in violation of permit conditions and the insurance policy, and the insurance company had the right to recover the compensation amount from the driver. The court awarded a sum of Rs. 6,89,000 as compensation to the victims and directed the insurance company to pay the amount and recover it from the driver. The awarded amount was to be deposited in the State Bank of India, Saket Court Branch, New Delhi.

In the sixth case, the court order directs the insurance company to deposit the awarded amount in favor of the petitioners with State Bank of India, Saket Courts Complex Branch, and to file a compliance report within 30 days. The bank is directed to keep the awarded amount in a fixed deposit/savings account and to pay interest to the petitioners. Withdrawals from the account are permitted only after verification and with a photo identity card issued by the bank. The bank is also directed to file a half-yearly statement of account and retain the original fixed deposit receipts in safe custody. The insurance company is directed to furnish a copy of the award and cheques to the bank manager and inform the claimants/petitioners about the deposit. The order is to be complied with by March 4, 2014.

In all these cases, the court has awarded compensation to the petitioners based on the evidence presented and legal precedents. The court has also held the drivers, owners, and insurance companies liable for the accidents and directed them to pay compensation to the victims. The court has used various methods to calculate the compensation, such as the multiplier method based on the deceased's income and age. The court has also directed the insurance companies to deposit the awarded amount in favor of the petitioners with a designated bank and file compliance reports. These court orders serve as a reminder to drivers, owners, and insurance companies to follow traffic rules and regulations and ensure road safety to prevent accidents and loss of life.
