The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently disposed of several writ petitions challenging Show Cause Notices issued by the Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners argued that the notices were issued by an officer/authority of the Board, rather than the Board itself, and that the resolution authorizing the officer to issue notices was impermissible. They also argued that the officer had referred the case to the National Green Tribunal without the petitioners being a party, and that there was no provision for imposing Environment Compensation under the relevant Acts. The court found that the issue was the same in all the writ petitions and disposed of them with a common judgment.

The court order states that before imposing any Environment Compensation and passing orders under Section 33A of the Water Act, the petitioners should have been given an opportunity of hearing. The court also mentions that the Water Act provides an alternative remedy under Section 33B of the Water Act to prefer an Appeal before the National Green Tribunal. The court allows the Principal Secretary (Environment, Science & Technology) to the Government of Himachal Pradesh and the Authorities under the Water Act to issue appropriate directions to the petitioners to prevent emission of the treated effluent strictly in terms of the provisions of Law. The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting and preserving water bodies and adhering to rules and regulations for environment protection. The writ petitions are disposed of with a direction to the parties to appear before the Principal Secretary on 30th July, 2020.
