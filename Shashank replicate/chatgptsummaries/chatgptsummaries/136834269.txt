The court order pertains to multiple cases related to environmental protection and offenses under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The first case involves allegations of destruction of mangroves on a plot of land in Mumbai, and the accused include the Chief Promoter of Shree Swami Samartha Prasanna Co-operative Housing Society and others associated with Samartha Development Corporation. The plans for construction on the plot have been sanctioned by various authorities, including the Municipal Corporation for Greater Mumbai and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment on the matter.

In the second case, a complaint was filed against the Shree Swami Samartha Prasanna Co-operative Housing Society for allegedly dumping debris near mangrove trees without seeking prior permission. The applicants challenged the charge-sheet and order taking cognizance of the offense, arguing that the due process of law was not followed. The court referred to relevant judgments before reserving its decision.

The court order outlines the penalties for contravening the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, including imprisonment for up to five years, a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both. If the contravention continues for over a year after conviction, the offender may face imprisonment for up to seven years. The court also explains that cognizance of an offense under the Act can only be taken if a complaint is made by the Central Government or an authorized authority or officer, or if a person gives notice of the alleged offense and their intention to make a complaint.

The court directs the authority under the Noise Pollution Rules to ensure immediate action upon receiving information about major violations. If there is a major violation of the Noise Pollution Rules, immediate information must be provided to the officers of the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board or the District Collector who have been authorized to take action. The occupier of an institution will be responsible for any alleged offense under Section 5 of the Act read with Rules 5 and 6 of the Bio-Medical Waste Rules.

The court order also directs a Committee to ensure proper coordination between authorized officers and police officers, and for the Central Government to consider appointing police officers as authorized officers to effectively implement the Act. It clarifies that only authorized officers can register offenses under the Act, and private individuals can file complaints only after following the prescribed procedure. The order also directs the Committee to ensure proper conduct of prosecutions for offenses under the Act and sets a date for further consideration of compliance.

The court emphasizes that offenses must be prosecuted only in the manner prescribed by the Act and not in any other manner. The order cites previous judgments that hold that only authorized officers can take cognizance of offenses under the Act and not police reports. The order applies these principles to the instant case and finds that the cognizance of the offense has been taken on the basis of a police report, which is impermissible.

The court also discusses a case where a Food Inspector launched a prosecution for an offense under the Food (Health) Authority Act without proper authorization. The court held that Section 20(1) of the Act does not allow for prosecution by any person other than those designated, and that the terms of the section do not allow for further delegation of powers. The court also found fault with the registration of an FIR and filing of a charge-sheet based on GPS readings and spot inspection, and set aside the order taking cognizance of the offense. However, the court did not quash and set aside the FIR, and instead modulated the relief to be granted.

In the first case, the court order sets aside a previous order and charge-sheet, but allows for the investigation to continue and for a complaint to be filed within 12 weeks. The learned magistrate is to pass appropriate orders regarding cognizance if the procedure is followed. The applicants' contentions on merits are kept open for future proceedings. The criminal application is allowed to the extent mentioned and the rule is made absolute.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of following due process and the prescribed procedures for filing complaints and taking cognizance of offenses under the Environmental Protection Act. It also highlights the penalties for contravening the Act and directs authorities to take immediate action upon receiving information about major violations. The order sets a date for further consideration of compliance and emphasizes that offenses must be prosecuted only in the manner prescribed by the Act.
