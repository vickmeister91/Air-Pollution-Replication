The court found no justifiable reasons to keep him in custody any further, as he had no criminal antecedents and there was no likelihood of him absconding or tampering with evidence. The court directed Kahar Singh to be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond and a solvent surety.

The court's decision to grant bail to Kahar Singh is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. Bail is a legal right that allows a person to be released from custody while awaiting trial.
