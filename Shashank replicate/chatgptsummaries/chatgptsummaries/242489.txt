In a recent court ruling, a preliminary objection regarding the recording of a compromise in a proceeding in executions was overruled. The court determined that a proceeding to set aside a sale under Order XXI, Rule 90, is not a proceeding in execution, and therefore, a compromise in such a proceeding could be recorded under Order XXIII, Rule 3. This decision has significant implications for future cases involving compromises in proceedings to set aside sales.

The court also decided that an enquiry must be held into the question of whether the matter has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement between the parties. This means that the court will investigate whether the parties have reached a lawful agreement that resolves the matter at hand. If such an agreement exists, it may impact the court's decision on the case.

The matter was set to be placed before the court for final disposal on a specific date, and no adjournment would be granted. This indicates that the court is taking a firm stance on the matter and is committed to resolving it in a timely manner. It also suggests that the court is not willing to grant any further delays or adjournments, which could impact the outcome of the case.

Overall, this court ruling has important implications for future cases involving compromises in proceedings to set aside sales. It clarifies the rules regarding the recording of compromises in such proceedings and emphasizes the importance of investigating whether the matter has been adjusted by any lawful agreement between the parties. Additionally, the court's decision to not grant any adjournments indicates a commitment to resolving the matter in a timely manner.
