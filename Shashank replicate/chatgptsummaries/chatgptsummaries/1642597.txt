The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri Durga Cement Company Ltd. challenging orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Hazaribagh, and East Division. The orders directed the company to stop transportation of minerals through the forest area and to stop mining and ancillary activities in all sorts of forest areas. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition, holding that all mining activities, including transportation of minerals in the forest area, are prohibited except with the permission of the Central Government.

The appellants appealed against this decision, but the court rejected their appeal, stating that the transportation of minerals through the forest area is also prohibited, and the Supreme Court's directions in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India are binding on all those who carry on or want to carry on any prohibited activity in the forest area.

The case at hand involves the issue of mining and transportation of minerals through forest areas. The Divisional Forest Officer had issued orders directing Sri Durga Cement Company Ltd. to stop all mining and ancillary activities in forest areas and to stop transportation of minerals through the forest area. The company challenged these orders by filing a writ petition in court.

The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition, holding that all mining activities, including transportation of minerals in the forest area, are prohibited except with the permission of the Central Government. The judge relied on the Supreme Court's directions in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India, which had prohibited all mining activities in forest areas without the permission of the Central Government.

The appellants appealed against this decision, arguing that the transportation of minerals through the forest area should not be prohibited. However, the court rejected their appeal, stating that the transportation of minerals through the forest area is also prohibited. The court held that the Supreme Court's directions in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India are binding on all those who carry on or want to carry on any prohibited activity in the forest area.

The court's decision in this case has significant implications for mining companies and other entities that carry out activities in forest areas. The court has made it clear that all mining activities, including transportation of minerals through the forest area, are prohibited without the permission of the Central Government. This decision reinforces the importance of protecting forest areas and ensuring that they are not exploited for commercial gain.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the need for strict regulation of mining activities in forest areas. The court has made it clear that all mining activities, including transportation of minerals through the forest area, are prohibited without the permission of the Central Government. This decision is a step towards protecting our forests and ensuring that they are not exploited for commercial gain.
