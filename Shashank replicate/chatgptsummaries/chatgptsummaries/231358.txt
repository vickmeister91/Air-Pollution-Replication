In a civil suit for damages filed by a workman in a civil court, the court order discusses the issue of whether the suit is maintainable under the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act. The workman had suffered an injury to his eye while on the job, and alleged negligence on the part of his employer and the persons appointed by the employer to provide timely and efficient medical aid for treatment of the injury received by the workman in the course of his employment. 

The trial court had found that the suit was barred by Sub-section (5) of S. 3 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, but the higher court reversed this finding and held that the suit was maintainable. The court also discussed the relevant provisions of the Act and whether the relief prayed for in the workman's civil suit flows from the accident arising out of and in the course of the workman's employment.

The court determined that the workman was entitled to compensation for the loss of his right eye, but a civil suit for damages on other grounds, such as alleged negligence by the employer or their doctors, is not barred by the Act. The court also determined that the Mehsana Court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The appeal partially succeeded, with no order as to costs.

In another court order, the remand was maintained with a modification. The appeal partially succeeded and there will be no order for the costs of the appeal. However, the details of the case were not provided in the summary.

Overall, the court orders discussed the issue of maintainability of civil suits for damages filed by workmen under the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act. The court clarified that while compensation for injuries suffered on the job is covered under the Act, civil suits for damages on other grounds may still be filed. The jurisdiction of the court to hear the case was also discussed.
