The court order pertains to a case where the managing director and director of a pharmaceutical company challenged orders passed by a Chief Judicial Magistrate rejecting their applications to recall the process issued against them. The court found that the judge had not applied his mind properly and had ignored the contents of the application. The court also examined the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and found that the complaint did not contain any averment that the accused directors were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time the drug was manufactured or when the samples were collected.

The court order discusses the requirements for prosecuting individuals, specifically directors, in cases where a company is accused of committing an offense. The court cites several cases where the complaint must contain allegations that the directors were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business at the time of the offense. Without such allegations, there cannot be a presumption of guilt. The court also notes that the substance of the allegations must fulfill the requirements of the relevant law for the offense alleged to have been committed.

The court order discusses a complaint against individuals for manufacturing and selling a drug of non-standard quality. The court finds that there are no specific allegations against accused Nos. 3 and 4, who are described as directors of the company, in the complaint. The court also distinguishes between a manager and a managing director and notes that accused No. 3, described as a managing director, cannot be presumed to be in charge of or responsible for the company's conduct of business without specific averments. The court quashes the process issued against the accused but clarifies that the trial court can exercise its discretion if additional evidence is presented.

The court order has been made absolute with clarification.
