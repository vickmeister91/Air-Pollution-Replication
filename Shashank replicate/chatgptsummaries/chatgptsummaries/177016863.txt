The Gujarat High Court recently granted permission to Omkar Intermediates to withdraw their petition and initiate appropriate proceedings before the appropriate forum, including an appeal to the National Green Tribunal, as provided under Section 33.B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petition was dismissed as withdrawn with the aforementioned liberty.

The case pertains to a petition filed by Omkar Intermediates, a chemical manufacturing company, challenging the show-cause notice issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for the closure of their manufacturing unit. The GPCB had issued the notice on the grounds of non-compliance with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

Omkar Intermediates had contended that the show-cause notice was issued without following the due process of law and without giving them an opportunity to be heard. They had also argued that the closure of their manufacturing unit would result in a loss of employment for their workers and would have a negative impact on the economy of the region.

The Gujarat High Court had earlier granted an interim stay on the show-cause notice issued by the GPCB. However, during the course of the proceedings, it was revealed that Omkar Intermediates had not obtained the necessary environmental clearances for their manufacturing unit. The court had directed the company to obtain the necessary clearances and had also directed the GPCB to conduct an inspection of the unit.

Subsequently, the GPCB had conducted an inspection of the manufacturing unit and had found that it was not complying with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The GPCB had then issued a show-cause notice to the company for the closure of their manufacturing unit.

In light of these developments, Omkar Intermediates had sought permission from the Gujarat High Court to withdraw their petition and initiate appropriate proceedings before the appropriate forum, including an appeal to the National Green Tribunal, as provided under Section 33.B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court granted the permission and dismissed the petition as withdrawn with the aforementioned liberty.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of environmental laws and obtaining the necessary clearances before setting up a manufacturing unit. It also underscores the need for due process of law to be followed while issuing show-cause notices and taking action against non-compliant units. The decision of the Gujarat High Court to grant permission to Omkar Intermediates to withdraw their petition and initiate appropriate proceedings before the appropriate forum, including an appeal to the National Green Tribunal, as provided under Section 33.B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a step in the right direction towards ensuring environmental compliance and protection.
