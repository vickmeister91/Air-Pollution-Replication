The Madras High Court recently heard a case brought by a senior advocate challenging the validity of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act. The petitioner argued that the introduction of a "Green Tax" and the levy of a lifetime tax for new vehicle registration were beyond the competency of the State Legislature and violated Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court considered whether the Green Tax fell under the Union List and concluded that it did not, as it was a tax on the use of motor vehicles on the road and not a law on pollution. The court also noted that the Supreme Court had previously upheld the validity of the lifetime tax based on weight-cum-value.

The court ordered that legislation should be enacted to prohibit public transport vehicles from plying without a catalytic converter. The Karnataka government has already issued a notification directing all auto-rickshaws to convert to CNG vehicles within a specific time. The court concluded that pollution falls under the state list's entry 6, which is "public health," and the state government has the power to legislate on the subject. The court rejected the contentions raised by Mr. Vijayan, learned Senior Advocate, relating to "Green tax." The court also considered the challenge relating to "lifetime tax" and concluded that the lifetime tax based on the value of the vehicle is constitutional and does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution.

The High Court held that the amending Act 27 of 1998, which imposed a lifetime tax based on the value of the vehicle registered on and after 1-7-1998, was inconsistent with Section 4(1-A)(b). The Supreme Court disagreed with this and held that the index of "weight-cum-value" maintains the nexus with the essential character of the levy in question. The Supreme Court also held that the new index "weight-cum-value" and factors like paying capacity of the owner have nexus with the use of roads over a period of time and hence the impugned levy fell within Entry 57 List-II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The Supreme Court rejected the contention relating to violation of Article 14 of the Constitution and concluded that the levy of lifetime tax is based on rational and reasonable classification founded on an intelligible differentia having a rational relation to the object of the impugned levy.

The court order discusses the validity of a motor vehicle tax in Tamil Nadu, which is based on the cost of the vehicle. The court rejects arguments that the tax is arbitrary and discriminatory, and concludes that the state legislature has the power to fix the tax as a percentage of the total cost of the vehicle. The court also cites similar taxation measures in other states and concludes that the tax is compensatory in nature. The court upholds the constitutionality of the tax and dismisses all writ petitions.

In summary, the Madras High Court has upheld the validity of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, including the introduction of a "Green Tax" and the levy of a lifetime tax for new vehicle registration. The court has also ordered legislation to prohibit public transport vehicles from plying without a catalytic converter and has concluded that pollution falls under the state list's entry 6, which is "public health." The court has rejected contentions relating to the "Green tax" and the "lifetime tax" and has upheld the constitutionality of the motor vehicle tax in Tamil Nadu, which is based on the cost of the vehicle. The court has cited similar taxation measures in other states and has concluded that the tax is compensatory in nature.
