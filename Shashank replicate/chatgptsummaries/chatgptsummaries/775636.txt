The court order in question is related to a petition filed by Mahesh Dyeing House against the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had requested that the respondents not use coercive methods to force them to shift their Dyeing Unit to a new location. The court found that the unit had been operating without a consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board and that the Board had issued a notice to disconnect the electric supply. 

The court granted the petitioner an extension until September 15, 2009, to shift the unit to its new location, failing which the Board would be free to disconnect the electric supply and take other necessary steps to shut down the unit. This decision was made after considering the arguments presented by both parties and examining the relevant laws and regulations.

The petitioner, Mahesh Dyeing House, had argued that they had been operating the unit for several years and had not received any notice from the Pollution Control Board regarding the lack of consent to operate. They also claimed that they had applied for consent to operate in 2007, but had not received any response from the Board. The petitioner further argued that they had invested a significant amount of money in the unit and that shifting it to a new location would cause them financial hardship.

The Punjab Pollution Control Board, on the other hand, argued that the unit was causing significant pollution and that it was necessary to shut it down or relocate it to a new location. They claimed that the petitioner had been given several notices regarding the lack of consent to operate and that they had not taken any action to rectify the situation.

After examining the arguments presented by both parties, the court found that the unit had indeed been operating without a consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the Board had issued a notice to disconnect the electric supply, which indicated that they were serious about enforcing the law.

However, the court also took into consideration the fact that the petitioner had invested a significant amount of money in the unit and that shifting it to a new location would cause them financial hardship. Therefore, the court granted the petitioner an extension until September 15, 2009, to shift the unit to its new location.

The court's decision was based on a careful examination of the relevant laws and regulations, as well as the arguments presented by both parties. The court recognized the importance of enforcing environmental regulations, but also took into consideration the financial hardship that the petitioner would face if they were forced to immediately shut down or relocate the unit.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Mahesh Dyeing House against the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The court found that the unit had been operating without a consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board and that the Board had issued a notice to disconnect the electric supply. The court granted the petitioner an extension until September 15, 2009, to shift the unit to its new location, failing which the Board would be free to disconnect the electric supply and take other necessary steps to shut down the unit. The court's decision was based on a careful examination of the relevant laws and regulations, as well as the arguments presented by both parties.
