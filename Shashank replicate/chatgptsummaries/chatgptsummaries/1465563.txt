The court order pertains to three separate writ petitions filed by different parties against the State of Karnataka regarding illegal mining activities in forest areas. The court considers several issues related to these petitions, including the power of the Forest Department to seize equipment used for illegal mining, the use of the Lokayukta report as a basis for initiating legal action, and the suspension of mining licenses for violations of lease agreements.

In the first petition filed by Sri B. Kumar Gouda, the petitioner argues that the Forest Department's seizure of equipment, machinery, vehicles, and iron on 12.2.2009 was unjustified and illegal. The court considers whether the Lokayukta report can be the basis for registering an FIR against the petitioner and passing an order of seizure. The court concludes that the Lokayukta report can be a basis for initiating lawful action against the petitioner and that the Forest Department has the power to take action against lease agreement violations.

In the second petition, the court discusses several issues related to a case involving illegal mining in a forest area. The court notes that while the Lokayukta report can be used as a basis for initiating legal action, the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to be heard before the report was used to file an FIR and seize equipment. The court emphasizes the importance of natural justice and the need for evidence to be collected and produced before making a decision. The court concludes that the forest authorities have the power to seize equipment used for illegal mining and that such an exercise of power is not arbitrary or unreasonable.

In the third petition, the court discusses the power of the Forest Department to take action against violations of lease agreements. The court concludes that the department is empowered to suspend mining licenses if the lessee violates the conditions of the agreement. However, the court also notes that the suspension of mining operations must be based on ample evidence of violations and cannot be arbitrary or unreasonable. The court directs the Deputy Conservator of Forests to inspect the leased area and assess damages caused by any illegal mining outside the leased area. The court orders the petitioner to rectify any violations and return tools and machinery to the Controller of Mines. Finally, the court permits the petitioner to undertake mining operations in the leased area that are not disputed by the forest authorities.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of following due process and collecting sufficient evidence before taking legal action or suspending mining operations. The Forest Department is granted the power to take action against lease agreement violations and seize equipment used for illegal mining, but this power must be exercised reasonably and based on ample evidence. The Lokayukta report can be used as a basis for initiating legal action, but the affected parties must be given an opportunity to be heard before any action is taken. The court's order seeks to balance the interests of the Forest Department and the mining industry while also protecting the environment and ensuring that natural justice is upheld.
