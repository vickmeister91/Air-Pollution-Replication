The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s Anjaney Ferro Alloys Ltd against the State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had sought relief from the court against the respondents for allegedly failing to grant them consent to operate their ferro alloys plant in Jharkhand. The Union of India, however, objected to the maintainability of the writ petition citing the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and the Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan case.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides that any person aggrieved by an order or decision of the National Green Tribunal may appeal to the Supreme Court within 90 days from the date of communication of the order or decision.

The Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan case, on the other hand, was a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of India in which the court had held that the right to a clean environment was a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court had also directed the Union of India to take appropriate measures to ensure that the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy were adequately compensated and rehabilitated.

The court, after considering the submissions of both parties, directed that the matter be transferred to the National Green Tribunal, Kolkata Bench. The court observed that the issues raised in the writ petition were squarely covered by the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them under the Act. The court also noted that the transfer of the matter to the National Green Tribunal would ensure that the matter was dealt with by a specialized forum with expertise in environmental matters.

The petitioner was asked to approach the Registrar General for deposit of the cost required for transmission within two weeks. This cost is required to be deposited by the petitioner as per the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The Act provides that any person aggrieved by an order or decision of the National Green Tribunal may appeal to the Supreme Court within 90 days from the date of communication of the order or decision, subject to the deposit of a certain amount as cost.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s Anjaney Ferro Alloys Ltd against the State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The court, after considering the submissions of both parties, directed that the matter be transferred to the National Green Tribunal, Kolkata Bench. The petitioner was asked to approach the Registrar General for deposit of the cost required for transmission within two weeks. This order highlights the importance of specialized forums like the National Green Tribunal in dealing with environmental matters and the availability of alternative remedies under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.
