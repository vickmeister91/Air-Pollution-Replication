The court order in question pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction case where the petitioner, Niraj Kumar, was aggrieved by an order dated 19.8.2017, which directed the closure of his establishment on grounds of not obtaining permission of 'Consent to Operate' as stipulated under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief from the order.

The court heard arguments from both sides and concluded that no cause was made for indulgence or interference with the notice under challenge impugned at Annexure 3 or the show cause at Annexure R5/B of the counter affidavit. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to obtain the necessary permissions under the relevant pollution control laws. The court noted that the purpose of these laws was to prevent and control pollution, and that the closure order was issued in furtherance of this objective. The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the pollution control laws themselves, and therefore, the court could not interfere with the order.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with pollution control laws and obtaining the necessary permissions before starting any industrial activity. Failure to do so can result in closure orders and legal proceedings, which can be time-consuming and costly.

In conclusion, the court order in this case serves as a reminder to all industrial establishments to comply with pollution control laws and obtain the necessary permissions before starting any activity. It also highlights the importance of challenging the validity of laws if one wishes to challenge the orders issued under them.
