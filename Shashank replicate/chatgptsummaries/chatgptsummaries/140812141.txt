In a recent court order, Kamal Adivasi has been granted bail in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The applicant had been in custody since December 2018 and was facing trial under various sections of the act. The court deemed it proper to grant bail to the applicant on the grounds of parity with a co-accused who was released on bail earlier.

The court order stated that the applicant is required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and participate in the trial regularly without involving himself in similar offenses or tampering with evidence. This condition is imposed to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or interfere with the trial proceedings.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on the principle of parity, which means that the applicant should be treated similarly to the co-accused who was released on bail earlier. This principle is based on the idea that similarly situated individuals should be treated similarly by the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is also based on the fact that he has been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court recognizes that prolonged detention can have a detrimental effect on the mental and physical health of the accused. Therefore, the court has granted bail to the applicant to ensure that he does not suffer any further harm due to prolonged detention.

The court has also imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that he does not abscond or interfere with the trial proceedings. The applicant is required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000, which is a financial guarantee that he will appear in court for trial. The applicant is also required to participate in the trial regularly without involving himself in similar offenses or tampering with evidence. These conditions are imposed to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or interfere with the trial proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to Kamal Adivasi is based on the principle of parity and the fact that he has been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that he does not abscond or interfere with the trial proceedings. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is a step towards ensuring that justice is served in a fair and impartial manner.
