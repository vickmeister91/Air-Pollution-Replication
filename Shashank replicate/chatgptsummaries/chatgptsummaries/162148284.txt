The court order discussed a case where a writ petition was filed challenging an order granting coastal regulations zone clearance. The question before the court was whether the petition could be transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) or not. The court heard arguments from both sides, with one side arguing that the High Court's writ jurisdiction cannot be taken away by the establishment of the NGT, while the other argued that the NGT should handle environmental issues and matters covered under its provisions. The court ultimately left the question open for future consideration and did not transfer the petition to the NGT.

However, the court order did direct that all matters covered under the NGT Act and Schedule I to the NGT Act, instituted after its coming into force, shall stand transferred and can only be instituted before the NGT. The court also cautioned that cases filed and pending prior to the NGT Act involving environmental laws and/or relating to any of the seven Statutes specified in Schedule I of the Act should also be dealt with by the NGT. The court further explained that where an order was passed before the Act came into force and was challenged in a court after the Act came into force, all such matters may be transferred to the NGT.

The court also allowed the writ petition to be transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. This decision was significant as it clarified the jurisdiction of the NGT and its role in handling environmental matters. The NGT was established in 2010 to handle environmental disputes and enforce environmental laws. However, there was some confusion regarding its jurisdiction and whether it could handle cases that were already pending before other courts.

The court order also stated that after the judgment was given, the senior counsel representing respondent no. 4 requested a one-month stay on the implementation of the judgment due to its importance. The court granted the request and the implementation of the judgment was stayed for one month from the date of the order. The parties were to receive a copy of the judgment by February 16, 2015, upon payment of usual charges.

Overall, the court order clarified the jurisdiction of the NGT and its role in handling environmental matters. It also left open the question of whether writ petitions challenging environmental clearances could be transferred to the NGT. The court's decision to allow the writ petition to be transferred to the NGT for adjudication was significant as it demonstrated the court's willingness to defer to the expertise of the NGT in handling environmental matters. The stay on the implementation of the judgment also demonstrated the court's recognition of the importance of the case and the need for further consideration.
