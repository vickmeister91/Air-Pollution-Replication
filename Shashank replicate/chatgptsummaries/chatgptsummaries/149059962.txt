In a recent court case, the petitioner sought a direction to the police to seize a gold chain that was pledged by an employee who stole it from the petitioner's jewelry shop. The chain was pledged with Muthoot FinCorp Limited, who accepted it on the belief that it belonged to the employee. The police have filed a petition to have the chain produced before the court, and the court has directed the petitioner to file an application under Section 451 Cr.P.C before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.V, Coimbatore, who will pass appropriate orders with regard to the interim custody of the gold chain to the petitioner, after hearing Muthoot FinCorp Limited and the state.

The petitioner in this case is seeking justice for the theft of a gold chain from their jewelry shop. The chain was stolen by an employee who then pledged it with Muthoot FinCorp Limited. The petitioner believes that the chain rightfully belongs to them and is seeking a direction to the police to seize it. The police have filed a petition to have the chain produced before the court, indicating that they believe the chain is evidence in the case.

The court has directed the petitioner to file an application under Section 451 Cr.P.C before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.V, Coimbatore. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code deals with the custody of property pending inquiry or trial. The petitioner will have to present their case before the magistrate, who will then pass appropriate orders with regard to the interim custody of the gold chain. The magistrate will hear from Muthoot FinCorp Limited and the state before making a decision.

It is important to note that the order under Section 451 Cr.P.C is not final and it is open to the court to change custody in appropriate cases. This means that the petitioner may not necessarily be granted custody of the gold chain, even if they are able to prove that it rightfully belongs to them. The court will consider all the evidence presented before making a decision.

This case highlights the importance of proper documentation and due diligence when accepting pledged items. Muthoot FinCorp Limited accepted the gold chain on the belief that it belonged to the employee who pledged it. However, it is clear that the chain was stolen from the petitioner's jewelry shop. This case also highlights the importance of seeking legal recourse when faced with theft or other criminal activities.

In conclusion, the court has directed the petitioner to file an application under Section 451 Cr.P.C before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.V, Coimbatore, who will pass appropriate orders with regard to the interim custody of the gold chain to the petitioner, after hearing Muthoot FinCorp Limited and the state. The order under Section 451 Cr.P.C is not final and it is open to the court to change custody in appropriate cases. This case highlights the importance of proper documentation and due diligence when accepting pledged items, as well as the importance of seeking legal recourse when faced with theft or other criminal activities.
