The court order pertains to a case where the deceased was working as a driver for a truck tanker and died in an accident while on duty. The claimants, who were the deceased's wife and children, filed for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The respondent no.1 admitted the claim, but the respondent no.2, an insurance company, contested it on the grounds that the deceased did not hold a valid driving license for the type of vehicle he was driving, which was carrying inflammable goods.

The court held that the insurance company was not liable to pay compensation as per the insurance policy clause, which required the driver to hold a valid driving license for the type of vehicle being driven. The insurance policy only requires the driver of a vehicle to hold an effective driving license and not be disqualified from driving at the time of the accident. The deceased driver in this case was holding a valid license to drive a heavy vehicle or transport vehicle, and there was no evidence to show that he was disqualified from driving.

The insurance company's defense that the driver did not hold a special license to transport hazardous chemicals was also dismissed as there was no provision in the Motor Vehicles Act or Rules to show that such a license was required. The court held that there was no nexus between the accident and the hazardous chemical being transported, and the insurance company could not be absolved from liability unless there was a breach of the insurance policy conditions directly related to the accident.

The court order discusses the types of vehicles covered in claims for compensation for accidents and the conditions of driving licenses that may arise. The court also addresses the issue of insurance policies under the Public Liability Insurance Act and concludes that a valid insurance policy was taken by the respondent for the vehicle, making the insurance company liable to indemnify the respondent for the loss incurred in the accident.

The appeal is allowed, and the impugned order dismissing the claim against the insurance company is set aside.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where the deceased was working as a driver for a truck tanker and died in an accident while on duty. The claimants, who were the deceased's wife and children, filed for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The respondent no.1 admitted the claim, but the respondent no.2, an insurance company, contested it on the grounds that the deceased did not hold a valid driving license for the type of vehicle he was driving, which was carrying inflammable goods.
