The case in question involves a petitioner who filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, and direct the respondent to produce certain documents. However, the Court dismissed the petition, stating that it was not legally maintainable as a similar petition had already been dismissed earlier.

The Court relied on a decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that an accused is not entitled to maintain a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, before the framing of charges. This decision was based on the reasoning that Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is meant to be used by the prosecution and not the accused.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the Supreme Court has held that this provision is not available to an accused before the framing of charges.

The Court further noted that the petitioner had not made out any case for interference under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner had not shown that the impugned order was passed without jurisdiction or that there was any illegality or irregularity in the proceedings.

In light of these findings, the Court dismissed the petition as not maintainable. The petitioner was not entitled to maintain a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, before the framing of charges. Additionally, the petitioner had not made out any case for interference under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

This case highlights the limitations on the rights of an accused in criminal proceedings. While the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, provides for certain rights and remedies for the accused, these are subject to certain limitations and restrictions. In this case, the Supreme Court has held that an accused is not entitled to maintain a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, before the framing of charges.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the limitations and restrictions on the rights of an accused in criminal proceedings.
