The Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (M.P.S.R.T.C.) has been ordered by the court to maintain a fund to pay compensation to victims of accidents caused by its vehicles. The court order came in response to a writ petition filed by Kamla Bai, who alleged that the M.P.S.R.T.C. had not maintained the account as mandated under Section 146 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The petitioner claimed that the M.P.S.R.T.C. had not satisfied the awards passed against it in several cases, and therefore, it had no right to ply the buses until they were insured.

The court examined the provisions of Section 146 and held that until and unless a fund is established and maintained to honour the claim, the vehicle cannot be plied. The court also noted that the action of non-payment of compensation by M.P.S.R.T.C. even in cases where there is no stay order by the court in an appeal or other proceedings cannot be justified.

The court order stated that the M.P.S.R.T.C. had failed to satisfy awards passed against them for years, which is against the mandate of Section 146 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The M.P.S.R.T.C. is obligated to maintain a fund to satisfy awards passed or those that have attained finality, and the fund should be enough to make the payment of compensation.

The court directed the M.P.S.R.T.C. to take effective steps to maintain the fund and satisfy all awards passed within one year of attaining finality. The vehicles of M.P.S.R.T.C. should not be allowed to ply until they are insured with the insurance company and the fund is maintained. The M.P.S.R.T.C. is also directed to contribute to the fund if it falls short and to use the fund only for permissible items.

The court orders the M.P.S.R.T.C. to satisfy all awards passed before 1.10.2001 within four months. This means that the M.P.S.R.T.C. has to pay compensation to all victims of accidents caused by its vehicles before this date. The court has given the M.P.S.R.T.C. four months to do so.

The court order is significant because it ensures that victims of accidents caused by M.P.S.R.T.C. vehicles are compensated in a timely manner. The M.P.S.R.T.C. has been ordered to maintain a fund to pay compensation, which will ensure that victims are not left without compensation. The court has also directed the M.P.S.R.T.C. to take effective steps to maintain the fund and to contribute to it if it falls short.

The court order also ensures that the M.P.S.R.T.C. is held accountable for its actions. The M.P.S.R.T.C. has been ordered to satisfy all awards passed against it within one year of attaining finality. This means that the M.P.S.R.T.C. cannot delay payment of compensation to victims of accidents caused by its vehicles.

In conclusion, the court order is a significant step towards ensuring that victims of accidents caused by M.P.S.R.T.C. vehicles are compensated in a timely manner. The M.P.S.R.T.C. has been ordered to maintain a fund to pay compensation and to satisfy all awards passed against it within one year of attaining finality. The court order also ensures that the M.P.S.R.T.C. is held accountable for its actions and cannot delay payment of compensation to victims of accidents caused by its vehicles.
