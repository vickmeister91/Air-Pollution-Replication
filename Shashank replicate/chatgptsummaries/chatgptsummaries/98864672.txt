In the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors, the Supreme Court of India issued a court order on May 12, 2000, regarding pollution caused by a motel in the river bed and banks of the river Beas. The court ordered the motel to pay compensation for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area, remove the pollution caused by various constructions, construct a boundary wall, not discharge untreated effluents into the river, and show cause why pollution fine and damages should not be imposed. The court also discussed the importance of protecting the environment and the fundamental duties of citizens to do so.

The court order discusses various directions and judgments aimed at protecting the environment, including the "Polluter Pays Principle" which holds polluters responsible for the damage caused to the environment. The court also discusses the provisions for penalties and procedures for contravention of environmental protection laws, emphasizing the need for a fair trial and finding of guilt before imposing fines or imprisonment.

The court rejects the idea of imposing a pollution fine on M/s Span Motel without a trial and finding of guilt, stating that the power of the court under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be used to contravene specific provisions of the law. The court has the power to act independently of statutes under Article 142, but cannot ignore substantive rights of litigants or supplant substantive law. The court cannot use Article 142 to achieve something indirectly that cannot be achieved directly through statutory provisions.

M/s Span Motel cannot be punished with a fine without following the procedure prescribed by the Act and being found guilty. However, they can be held liable to pay damages for causing pollution, including exemplary damages as a deterrent. A fresh notice is issued to M/s Span Motel to show cause why exemplary damages should not be awarded in addition to damages already ordered. This question will be heard at the time of quantification of damages under the main judgment.

The court's order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the need for polluters to be held responsible for the damage caused. The court also stresses the need for a fair trial and finding of guilt before imposing fines or imprisonment. The court's rejection of the idea of imposing a pollution fine without a trial and finding of guilt highlights the importance of following the procedure prescribed by the Act and respecting the substantive rights of litigants.

The court's order also demonstrates the limitations of the court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution. While the court has the power to act independently of statutes, it cannot ignore substantive rights of litigants or supplant substantive law. The court's use of Article 142 must be in line with the provisions of the law and cannot be used to achieve something indirectly that cannot be achieved directly through statutory provisions.

Overall, the court's order in the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors highlights the importance of protecting the environment and holding polluters responsible for the damage caused. The court stresses the need for a fair trial and finding of guilt before imposing fines or imprisonment and demonstrates the limitations of the court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution. The court's order serves as a reminder of the fundamental duties of citizens to protect the environment and the importance of following the procedure prescribed by the Act and respecting the substantive rights of litigants.
