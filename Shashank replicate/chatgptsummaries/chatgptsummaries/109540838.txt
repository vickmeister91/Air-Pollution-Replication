The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Dr. Saba Tahir against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petition challenges an order passed by the Secretary, District Health Society, Hoshangabad, which terminated the services of the petitioners as contract Unani Medical Officers before the expiry of their term. The petitioners had completed their Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery (BUMS) final year examination in May 2012 but before completion of their internship and without valid registration with the Madhya Pradesh Ayurvedic & Unani and Natural Medical Board, they participated in the selection process and were appointed on a contract basis till 31 March 2014.

The court held that the appointment was void ab initio as the petitioners did not possess the requisite qualification for the post of contract Unani Medical Officer. The court also held that affording an opportunity for hearing would have been a "useless formality." The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners did not have the necessary qualifications for the position they were appointed to. The court found that the appointment was made in violation of the rules and regulations governing the appointment of Unani Medical Officers in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

The court order also discusses the concept of natural justice and the discretion of the court in cases where the facts are not admitted or beyond dispute. The court can refuse certiorari, prohibition, mandamus or injunction even if natural justice is not followed. The order also mentions the "useless formality" theory and the divergence of opinions on whether the applicant needs to prove the outcome will be in their favor or if they can prove a "real likelihood" of success.

The court ultimately dismisses the petition as lacking substance. The court found that the petitioners did not have a valid claim to the position they were appointed to and that their appointment was made in violation of the rules and regulations governing the appointment of Unani Medical Officers in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The court also found that the petitioners did not have the necessary qualifications for the position they were appointed to and that affording them an opportunity for hearing would have been a "useless formality."

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Dr. Saba Tahir against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The court held that the appointment of the petitioners as contract Unani Medical Officers was void ab initio as they did not possess the requisite qualification for the post. The court also held that affording an opportunity for hearing would have been a "useless formality."
