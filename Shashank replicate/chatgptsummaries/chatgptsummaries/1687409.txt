The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ujwala W against the Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation Limited and its Divisional Manager. The petitioner's service was terminated under the provisions of the Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation (MFDC) Service Regulations, citing that she had crossed the age limit of 33 years imposed in the advertisement. The petitioner argued that there were no rules prescribing the maximum age limit for appointment and that the respondents arbitrarily imposed the age limit of 33 years.

The court ruled that it is open to an employer to impose an age limit in the advertisement even if there is no age limit prescribed in the Regulations. The court cited a Supreme Court judgment that states that an order passed in violation of natural justice need not be set aside if no prejudice is caused to the person concerned. The petitioner's contention that the order of termination of her services is contrary to the principles of natural justice as no show cause notice has been issued was also dismissed by the court.

The court order discusses the principle that breach of natural justice must be accompanied by prejudice in order to be considered a violation. The exception to this principle is when admitted or indisputable facts lead to only one conclusion, in which case no prejudice can be said to have been caused. The case being discussed falls within this exception, as the admitted fact that the petitioner was over the age limit for the job led to only one conclusion of termination.

The court also notes that it will not grant relief based on other illegalities committed by the respondents. The writ petition is dismissed.

The court order in this case highlights the importance of following the rules and regulations set forth by an employer. The petitioner argued that there were no rules prescribing the maximum age limit for appointment, but the court ruled that it is open to an employer to impose an age limit in the advertisement even if there is no age limit prescribed in the Regulations. This decision reinforces the idea that employers have the right to set their own requirements for job applicants, as long as they do not violate any laws or regulations.

The court also addressed the issue of natural justice and the principle that breach of natural justice must be accompanied by prejudice in order to be considered a violation. The court cited a Supreme Court judgment that states that an order passed in violation of natural justice need not be set aside if no prejudice is caused to the person concerned. In this case, the court found that the petitioner's termination was based on an admitted fact that she was over the age limit for the job, which led to only one conclusion of termination. Therefore, the court found that no prejudice was caused to the petitioner and dismissed her contention that the order of termination of her services is contrary to the principles of natural justice as no show cause notice has been issued.

It is important to note that the court also stated that it will not grant relief based on other illegalities committed by the respondents. This means that even if there were other violations of laws or regulations committed by the respondents, the court would not grant relief unless those violations caused prejudice to the petitioner.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to both employers and employees to follow the rules and regulations set forth by the employer. Employers have the right to set their own requirements for job applicants, as long as they do not violate any laws or regulations. Employees must also be aware of these requirements and ensure that they meet them in order to avoid any potential issues with their employment. Additionally, the court's decision regarding natural justice highlights the importance of ensuring that all parties involved in a dispute are given a fair and just hearing.
