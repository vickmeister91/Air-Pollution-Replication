The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of stone crushing unit owners who had filed a writ petition seeking to quash closure notices issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board. The court found that the orders impugned in the writ petition were similar to those in a previous case, and therefore, the court followed the decision of the Division Bench in that case. The court quashed the closure notices and directed the respondents to permit the operation of the stone crushing units at the present site till such time their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The writ petition was filed by a group of stone crushing unit owners who had received closure notices from the Karnataka Pollution Control Board. The petitioners argued that the closure notices were issued without following due process of law and without giving them an opportunity to be heard. They also argued that the closure notices were arbitrary and unreasonable, and that they had been issued without any basis in law.
