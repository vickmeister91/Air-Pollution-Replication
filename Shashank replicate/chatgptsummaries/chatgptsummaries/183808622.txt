The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is the second accused facing trial for various offenses. During the course of the trial, the petitioner objected to the production of the original postmortem certificate and instead, a photocopy was marked in the examination of the Medical Officer who conducted the postmortem examination. The Public Prosecutor filed a petition to summon the original postmortem note and carbon copy of the postmortem certificate, which was opposed by the petitioner and other accused.

However, the court rejected the objection and allowed the petition to summon the documents. The petitioner challenged this order, but the court dismissed the case with a direction to provide a copy of the documents to the petitioner and other accused before further examination.

The court's decision to allow the petition to summon the original postmortem note and carbon copy of the postmortem certificate is significant as it could potentially provide crucial evidence in the case. The petitioner's objection to the production of the original document is understandable, as it could be argued that the photocopy is sufficient for the purposes of the trial.

However, the court's decision to reject the objection and allow the petition to summon the documents suggests that the court believes that the original document is necessary for a fair and just trial. The court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's challenge to this order is also significant, as it suggests that the court is confident in its decision and does not believe that it is necessary to revisit the issue.
