The case in question involves Satish Mehta, who is facing the possibility of arrest in connection with a criminal case. The petitioner has not yet been apprehended, but his name has been mentioned in a confessional statement made by a co-accused. In light of this, the court has issued an order directing the petitioner to surrender himself to the court within three weeks from the date of the order.

In addition to this, the court has also granted the petitioner anticipatory bail. This means that the petitioner will not be arrested if he surrenders himself to the court within the specified time frame. However, in order to secure this bail, the petitioner must furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 and provide two sureties of the same amount each.

The purpose of this order is to ensure that the petitioner appears before the court and cooperates with the legal process. By granting anticipatory bail, the court is providing the petitioner with some measure of protection against arrest, while also ensuring that he does not evade the legal process.

It is worth noting that the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail is not a guarantee that the petitioner will not be arrested. If the petitioner fails to surrender himself to the court within the specified time frame, or if he violates any of the conditions of his bail, he may still be arrested.

Overall, this court order is intended to balance the interests of the petitioner with the need to ensure that the legal process is carried out effectively. By granting anticipatory bail, the court is providing the petitioner with some measure of protection, while also ensuring that he appears before the court and cooperates with the legal process.
