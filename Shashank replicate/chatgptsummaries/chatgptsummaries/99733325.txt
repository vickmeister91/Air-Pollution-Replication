The Madras High Court recently set aside an order passed by the Sub-Collector of Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli, directing the Chairman and Managing Director of M/s. Hameed Marine Private Ltd. to stop functioning of the factory immediately. The court found that the order was passed without affording reasonable opportunity to the petitioner and without examining any witnesses. The court also noted that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had given consent for the industry to run the unit and renew the consent order to operate the unit till September 2019, which was not considered by the Sub-Collector.

The case pertains to the functioning of a factory owned by M/s. Hameed Marine Private Ltd. The Sub-Collector of Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli, had passed an order directing the Chairman and Managing Director of the company to stop the functioning of the factory immediately. The order was passed on the grounds that the factory was causing pollution and was a threat to the health of the people living in the area.

However, the Madras High Court found that the order was passed without affording reasonable opportunity to the petitioner and without examining any witnesses. The court noted that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had given consent for the industry to run the unit and renew the consent order to operate the unit till September 2019, which was not considered by the Sub-Collector.

The court also observed that the Sub-Collector had not followed the principles of natural justice while passing the order. The court held that the Sub-Collector should have given an opportunity to the petitioner to present his case and examine witnesses before passing the order. The court also noted that the Sub-Collector had not considered the fact that the factory was providing employment to a large number of people in the area.

The court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the Sub-Collector and directed the Chairman and Managing Director of M/s. Hameed Marine Private Ltd. to approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for renewal of the consent order to operate the unit.

In another case, the Madras High Court recently issued an order pertaining to the Criminal Record Section of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. However, no further details were provided about the case.
