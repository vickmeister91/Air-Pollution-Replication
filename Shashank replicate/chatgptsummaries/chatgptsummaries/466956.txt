The case was brought before the court, and it was found that there was a misjoinder of parties and causes of action. The suit could not proceed as framed. The plaintiffs were given the option to elect which one of them should proceed with the suit, and the plaint would be amended accordingly. If the election and amendment were not made within 15 days, the suit would be dismissed with costs.

The case revolved around the alleged libel contained in two articles published in the "Indian Daily News." The articles dealt with the "Sobha Bazar murder case," and the plaintiffs claimed Rs. 20,000 as damages. However, the court found that there was a misjoinder of parties and causes of action, which meant that the suit could not proceed as framed.

The plaintiffs were given the option to elect which one of them should proceed with the suit, and the plaint would be amended accordingly. This meant that the plaintiffs had to choose one person to represent them in court, and the case would proceed with that person as the plaintiff. If the election and amendment were not made within 15 days, the suit would be dismissed with costs.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there were six plaintiffs in the case, and they were all suing for the same alleged libel. This meant that there was a misjoinder of parties, as there should have been only one plaintiff in the case. Additionally, the causes of action were also misjoined, as all the plaintiffs were suing for the same alleged libel.

The court's decision was significant as it highlighted the importance of correctly framing a suit. It also emphasized the need for plaintiffs to elect one person to represent them in court, especially in cases where there are multiple plaintiffs suing for the same alleged libel.

In conclusion, the case of Aldridge vs Barrow was a significant one as it highlighted the importance of correctly framing a suit. The court's decision emphasized the need for plaintiffs to elect one person to represent them in court, especially in cases where there are multiple plaintiffs suing for the same alleged libel. The case also serves as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to ensure that they follow the correct procedures and guidelines to avoid any misjoinder of parties or causes of action.
