The court order in question relates to a case involving dishonoured post-dated cheques issued by the accused, who had leased a property from the complainant. The accused claimed to have paid the rent in cash, but the court found that the lease deed clearly stated that the rent was to be paid through cheques. The court held that oral evidence cannot be used to contradict the terms of a written agreement.

The accused was charged under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques. The section provides that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable and punished with imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or with a fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.

In this case, the court found that the accused had issued post-dated cheques to the complainant for the payment of rent, but the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The court held that the accused had committed an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and convicted him accordingly.

The court also noted that the accused had not denied issuing the cheques, but had instead claimed to have paid the rent in cash. However, the court found that the lease deed clearly mentioned the cheques and that the accused had not produced any evidence to support his claim of having paid the rent in cash. The court held that the accused's claim was not credible and that he had failed to discharge the burden of proof that lay on him.

The court further observed that the purpose of the Negotiable Instruments Act is to promote the use of negotiable instruments such as cheques, and to ensure that they are honoured when presented for payment. The court noted that dishonour of cheques is a serious offence that affects the credibility of the banking system and causes financial loss to the payee.

The court also held that the accused's offence was aggravated by the fact that he had issued post-dated cheques, which are a form of security for the payment of rent. The court noted that post-dated cheques are commonly used in lease agreements to ensure that the rent is paid on time, and that their dishonour can cause significant financial loss to the landlord.

The court therefore convicted the accused under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and ordered that he be heard on the point of sentence separately. The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to the terms of written agreements, and of the serious consequences that can result from the dishonour of negotiable instruments such as cheques.
