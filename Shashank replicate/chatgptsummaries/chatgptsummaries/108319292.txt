The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Smt. Azra Begum against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others challenging the cancellation of her quarry lease. The petitioner had been granted a prospecting license in 1992 and subsequently applied for a mineral lease in 1993. The lease was granted in 2001, but was cancelled in 2003 on the grounds that the area fell within 250 meters of a forest area, which was prohibited by a circular issued by the State Government in 2002.

The court found that the circular did not apply to the petitioner's mining lease, which had been granted before the circular was issued. The court quashed the cancellation of the lease and granted the State Government the liberty to cancel the lease for any other reason, but only after following the procedure as per law.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the applicability of circulars issued by the State Government. The court held that circulars cannot be applied retrospectively to mining leases that were granted before the circular was issued. This is an important principle as it ensures that mining leases are not cancelled arbitrarily on the basis of circulars that were not in force at the time the lease was granted.

The court also emphasized the importance of following due process of law while cancelling mining leases. The State Government was granted the liberty to cancel the lease for any other reason, but only after following the procedure as per law. This ensures that mining leases are cancelled only after a fair and transparent process, and not on the basis of arbitrary or discriminatory reasons.

The court order is also significant as it upholds the rights of mining lease holders. The petitioner had invested significant resources in developing the quarry and had been granted the lease after due process of law. The cancellation of the lease had caused significant financial losses to the petitioner. The court's decision to quash the cancellation of the lease ensures that the petitioner's rights as a mining lease holder are protected.

Overall, the court order is a significant development in the legal framework governing mining leases in Madhya Pradesh. It clarifies the legal position on the applicability of circulars issued by the State Government and emphasizes the importance of following due process of law while cancelling mining leases. The order also upholds the rights of mining lease holders and ensures that their investments are protected.
