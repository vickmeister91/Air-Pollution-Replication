The recent court order in India has transferred a writ petition filed by Janajagriti Samiti against the Union of India, State of Karnataka, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and M/S Udupi Power Corporation Limited to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi. The order is based on a Supreme Court judgment that environmental issues and matters covered under the National Green Tribunal Act should be litigated before the NGT to avoid conflict of orders between the High Courts and the NGT. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.

The writ petition filed by Janajagriti Samiti was related to the environmental impact of the Udupi Power Corporation Limited's thermal power plant in Karnataka. The petitioners had alleged that the plant was causing air and water pollution, and had violated various environmental laws and regulations. The petitioners had sought the closure of the plant and compensation for the damage caused to the environment and the health of the local residents.

The court order transferring the case to the NGT is significant as it reflects the growing importance of the NGT in India's environmental governance. The NGT was established in 2010 as a specialized court to deal with environmental disputes and violations. The NGT has jurisdiction over all environmental matters, including air and water pollution, forest conservation, biodiversity, and climate change. The NGT has the power to issue orders and directions to government agencies, industries, and individuals to protect the environment and to impose penalties for environmental violations.

The Supreme Court judgment that environmental issues and matters covered under the National Green Tribunal Act should be litigated before the NGT is aimed at avoiding conflicting orders between the High Courts and the NGT. The High Courts in India have the power to hear and decide on environmental cases, but their jurisdiction is limited to their respective states. This has led to situations where different High Courts have given conflicting orders on the same environmental issue, creating confusion and uncertainty for the parties involved.

The transfer of the writ petition to the NGT is expected to expedite the resolution of the case and to ensure a consistent and coherent approach to environmental governance in India. The NGT has a track record of delivering timely and effective judgments on environmental matters, and its decisions are binding on all parties. The NGT has also been proactive in promoting environmental awareness and education, and has taken steps to encourage public participation in environmental decision-making.

The Udupi Power Corporation Limited's thermal power plant has been a controversial issue in Karnataka for several years. The plant, which has a capacity of 1,200 MW, was commissioned in 2010 and has been operating since then. The plant uses coal as its primary fuel and has been accused of causing air and water pollution in the surrounding areas. The plant has also been criticized for violating various environmental laws and regulations, including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The transfer of the writ petition to the NGT is expected to provide a platform for a comprehensive and impartial assessment of the environmental impact of the Udupi Power Corporation Limited's thermal power plant. The NGT has the expertise and the mandate to evaluate the scientific and technical aspects of the case, and to consider the social and economic implications of the plant's operations. The NGT is also expected to take into account the concerns and perspectives of the local communities and other stakeholders who are affected by the plant's activities.

In conclusion, the recent court order transferring the writ petition filed by Janajagriti Samiti against the Union of India, State of Karnataka, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and M/S Udupi Power Corporation Limited to the National Green Tribunal in New Delhi is a significant development in India's environmental governance. The order reflects the growing importance of the NGT in addressing environmental disputes and violations, and the need for a consistent and coherent approach to environmental governance in India. The transfer of the case to the NGT is expected to expedite the resolution of the case and to ensure a comprehensive and impartial assessment of the environmental impact of the Udupi Power Corporation Limited's thermal power plant.
