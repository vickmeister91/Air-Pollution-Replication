The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by M/s G.S. Enterprises against the rejection of their Interlocutory Application seeking a stay on a closure notice issued by the Forester, Bhadudih, Jamshedpur. The notice was issued to the appellant for running a brick kiln in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, which is prohibited by the Ministry of Environment and Forests Notification.

The appellant had argued that the closure notice was issued without following due process and without giving them an opportunity to be heard. They also contended that the brick kiln was not causing any harm to the environment and that they had all the necessary permissions to operate it.

However, the court disposed of the appeal, giving liberty to the appellant to raise all contentions before the learned Single Judge in the pending writ petition. This means that the appellant can still argue their case before the Single Judge and present all their contentions, including those that were not considered by the court in this appeal.

The court's decision is in line with the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties be given a fair opportunity to present their case before a decision is made. The court has recognized the importance of hearing all contentions before arriving at a final decision and has given the appellant the opportunity to do so.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and giving all parties a fair opportunity to be heard. It also underscores the need to protect the environment and wildlife sanctuaries, which are crucial for maintaining ecological balance and preserving biodiversity.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests Notification prohibiting activities in the Eco-sensitive Zone of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal. It is important that such notifications are enforced and that violators are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dispose of the appeal and give the appellant the liberty to raise all contentions before the learned Single Judge in the pending writ petition is a fair and just one. It upholds the principles of natural justice and recognizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife sanctuaries. It is hoped that this case will serve as a reminder to all parties to follow due process and respect the laws and regulations in place to protect the environment.
