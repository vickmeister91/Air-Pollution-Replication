The court order in question involves multiple criminal miscellaneous cases involving various petitioners and respondents, including Oscar Fernandes and Subramanian Swamy. While the details of the cases and the legal representation for each party are listed, the specific content of the court order is not provided.

However, one of the court orders pertains to a criminal complaint filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others for alleged fraud, cheating, and other offenses related to the National Herald newspaper. The court is considering several petitions challenging orders to summon documents related to the case under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioners argue that the orders were passed without due application of mind and without giving them notice or an opportunity to be heard. The court has heard arguments from both sides and is considering the matter.

The court order discusses the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court states that a notice must be given to a person against whom a proposed action is to be taken and that the right of affording opportunity of hearing is a principle of natural justice that cannot be denied. The court also discusses the summoning of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and states that the document means legally permissible document either in the shape of original document or in the shape of copy duly authenticated. The court further states that the photocopy cannot be termed as a document as neither it is original nor it is authenticated without any person authenticating the same. The court concludes that the orders passed in the present case do not reflect any necessity or desirability to summon the documents.

Another court order states that a summons or written order can be issued to a person believed to be in possession of documents required for a criminal investigation. The power given under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a general and wide power that can be exercised by the court at any stage of the investigation, inquiry, or other proceedings. However, the court must consider whether the production of the document is necessary or desirable for the purpose of the trial. The party requesting the summons must demonstrate that the document is material for arriving at a just decision in the case. The court has to satisfy itself regarding the necessity or desirability of the documents sought to be produced.

The court order also discusses the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of necessity and relevancy in allowing the production of such evidence and warns against allowing it on a mere asking or as a matter of routine. The order also notes that the principle of natural justice requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before passing any judicial order. The court finds that the orders in the present case were passed in a casual manner without proper consideration of these requirements and principles.

The court order further states that directing an investigation based on vague and indefinite allegations goes against principles of natural justice. The accused has a right to a hearing before being charged or discharged, but the appellant is not an accused and therefore not entitled to notice before the order was passed. The order to investigate based on anonymous allegations without providing an opportunity to be heard is a violation of natural justice. The court also discusses the importance of the right to be heard and the appearance of justice. The complainant argues that notice is not mandatory before passing an order under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., but the court disagrees and emphasizes the importance of discretion and fairness in summoning documents.

Finally, the court order discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The learned Magistrate had observed that there were no materials before him to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application was desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial. The High Court had interfered with the discretion conferred on the trial courts in the matter of summoning documents, which would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time. The court set aside the orders dated 11.01.2016 and 11.03.2016 and held that while passing the order under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents, if the other party has already joined the proceedings, it is entitled to be heard. The right of the complainant shall not be curtailed in any circumstance to move the fresh application during the pendency of the proceedings before the Court below.

In summary, the court order involves multiple criminal miscellaneous cases involving various petitioners and respondents, including Oscar Fernandes and Subramanian Swamy. The court order discusses the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court emphasizes the importance of necessity and relevancy in allowing the production of evidence and warns against allowing it on a mere asking or as a matter of routine. The court finds that the orders in the present case were passed in a casual manner without proper consideration of these requirements and principles. The court also discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and emphasizes the importance of discretion and fairness in summoning documents.
