The case in question involved a petitioner who had filed a petition against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge. The order in question had dismissed a revision petition filed by the petitioner. The court below had confirmed the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, who had rejected an application filed by the petitioner.

However, the matter has since been resolved between the parties due to a compromise. As a result, the petition has become infructuous. This means that the petition is no longer relevant or necessary, as the issue at hand has been resolved.

Despite the fact that the petition has become infructuous, the petitioner is still able to approach the court again if needed. This means that if the issue at hand were to arise again in the future, the petitioner would be able to file a new petition and seek resolution through the court system.

It is worth noting that the resolution of the matter through a compromise is a common occurrence in legal proceedings. In many cases, parties are able to come to an agreement outside of court, which can save time and resources for all involved.

In this particular case, it is unclear what the nature of the dispute was or what the terms of the compromise were. However, it is clear that the matter has been resolved and that the petitioner has the option to approach the court again if needed.

Overall, while the details of the case are limited, it is clear that the petitioner had filed a petition against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, which had been dismissed. However, the matter has since been resolved through a compromise, rendering the petition infructuous. Despite this, the petitioner still has the option to approach the court again if needed.
