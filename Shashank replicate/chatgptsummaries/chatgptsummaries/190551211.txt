The Lokmangal Sanstha filed a civil suit against Sanjay Wadettiwar and others for constructing a rice mill near their vocational training institute, causing air and noise pollution and endangering the health of the trainees and staff. The case was transferred to the National Green Tribunal due to jurisdictional issues. The Respondents denied the allegations and claimed that the rice mill was not causing any pollution or harm to the environment. The court heard both sides and reserved judgment.

In a subsequent court order, the Lokmangal Sanstha filed an application regarding the environmental harm caused by the Sai Rice Mill. The Respondents argued that the Rice Mill did not cause any actionable nuisance or environmental harm. The court examined the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board for the installation of Rice Mills and noted that the handling, storage, and transport of rice husk are subject to mandatory guidelines. The court also considered the noise pollution caused by the mechanical equipment used in Rice Mills. The court examined the affidavit of a social worker who claimed that the Rice Mill emitted husk that caused water pollution and noise pollution. The court noted that the Rice Mill was situated close to the Training institute run by Lokmangal Sanstha and that the middle wall erected by the Respondents was not strong enough. The court recorded its findings in the last paragraph of the judgment.

In the subsequent court order, the court found that the rice mill caused noise and air pollution, and ordered the mill to take appropriate measures to control pollution before renewing its consent to operate. The court also ordered the mill to pay compensation to the training institute for causing pollution during the period it was in operation. The court found that the suit was not barred by limitation and partly allowed the application with costs.
