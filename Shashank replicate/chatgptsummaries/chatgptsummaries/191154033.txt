The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case involving Abu Bakkar Mridha and others against the State of West Bengal and others. The appellants were partners in a brick field business called Ashli Bricks, and private respondents claimed to be majority partners who had decided not to run the business without a valid quarry permit and order of conversion for change of classification of the land. The case involved a delay in filing an appeal, which was ultimately condoned by the court. The court then considered the merits of the case and ultimately dismissed a writ petition filed by the appellants, holding that the dispute between the two groups of individuals could not be decided by the Writ Court.

The court found that the writ petitioners did not come forward to ventilate their individual grievances before the Writ Court, but rather came forward collectively as partners of a partnership firm to espouse the grievance of the partnership firm. The court held that the writ petition was well maintainable on payment of a single court fee. The court also found that the DL&LRO misconstrued the direction passed by the National Green Tribunal Eastern Zone in OA No. 41 EZ/2014 and by misinterpreting the said order of the National Green Tribunal, the said authority passed the above direction upon the writ petitioners/appellants to close down the said business. The court set aside the impugned order as also the order passed by the DL&LRO, Barasat on 29th June, 2015 vide order No.3 in the Misc case No.215 of 2013.

The case involved a dispute between two groups of individuals who were partners in a brick field business called Ashli Bricks. The private respondents claimed to be majority partners who had decided not to run the business without a valid quarry permit and order of conversion for change of classification of the land. The appellants, on the other hand, argued that they were the rightful owners of the business and had been wrongfully excluded from it.

The court initially considered the issue of delay in filing an appeal, which was ultimately condoned by the court. The court then went on to consider the merits of the case and ultimately dismissed a writ petition filed by the appellants, holding that the dispute between the two groups of individuals could not be decided by the Writ Court.
