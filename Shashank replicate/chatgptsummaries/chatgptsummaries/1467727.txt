In a recent court order, the petitioner, who was a partner in a firm, had sued and had to travel twice from Madras to Bezwada to give evidence in support of the defendant's case. The petitioner had requested for his travelling expenses and subsistence allowance to be reimbursed, but the court disallowed it. The court found that there was no provision in the Civil Procedure Code to order the travelling expenses of a party who has given evidence in support of his own case. 

The court suggested that a similar rule to that framed and adopted by the Calcutta High Court should be made applicable to this High Court. However, since there was no such rule, the court dismissed the petition with costs. This court order raises important questions about the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there was no provision in the Civil Procedure Code to order the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case. This raises the question of whether there should be such a provision in the Code. The court suggested that a similar rule to that framed and adopted by the Calcutta High Court should be made applicable to this High Court. This would provide clarity and consistency in the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case.

The court's decision also raises the question of whether parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case should be reimbursed for their expenses. The court found that there was no provision in the Civil Procedure Code to order such reimbursement. However, this does not necessarily mean that parties should not be reimbursed for their expenses. It may be argued that parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case should be reimbursed for their expenses, as this would ensure that they are not unfairly burdened by the costs of litigation.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of having clear rules and procedures in place for the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case. The court suggested that a similar rule to that framed and adopted by the Calcutta High Court should be made applicable to this High Court. This would provide clarity and consistency in the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case.

In conclusion, the recent court order raises important questions about the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case. While the court found that there was no provision in the Civil Procedure Code to order such reimbursement, it suggested that a similar rule to that framed and adopted by the Calcutta High Court should be made applicable to this High Court. This would provide clarity and consistency in the reimbursement of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance for parties who have to travel to give evidence in support of their case.
