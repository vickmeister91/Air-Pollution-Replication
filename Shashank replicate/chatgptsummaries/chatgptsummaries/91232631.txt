The case of Sri Sudhakara involves a criminal petition to set aside an order passed by the Prl. District & Sessions Judge, Chitradurga, dated 12.07.2018 in S.C.No.52/2016. The order allowed the application filed by the prosecution under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and received on record the documents produced by the prosecution. The petitioner's contention is that the documents sought to be produced are the medical records relating to the treatment of the complainant-victim, and the proper course would have been to summon these documents from the hospital authorities rather than permitting the prosecution to produce the documents which were not part of the chargesheet. The court has reserved the liberty to the accused to call for the original documents from the hospital authorities.
