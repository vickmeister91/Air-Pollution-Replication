The Tamil Nadu Magnesite Ltd. had filed two writ petitions, one for quashing an order by the first respondent and the other for calling for an order by the first respondent and quashing it. The petitioner was engaged in mining magnesite from quarries situated in Salem. The petitioner had applied for renewal of mining which was rejected by the State Government. The mining application was submitted on August 25, 1981, and the same was disposed of by the Government under Section 24(3) under Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.

The Forest Department by its reply, dated December 3, 1986, called upon the petitioner to identify and transfer equivalent non-forest land as a precondition for forwarding the application to the State Government. The petitioner took steps to identify non-forest lands for transfer. Several lands were identified. But the Forest Department rejected the same for one reason or another.

The Supreme Court by order, dated December 12, 1996, directed that all ongoing activities within any forest area in any State throughout the country for which no prior approval of the Central Government has been secured should cease forthwith. The District Forest Officer directed the petitioner to stop the operations at once. This necessitated the petitioner taking up the matter with the Government, and the State Government advised that the orders of the Supreme Court had to be complied with, and there is no possibility to continue the mining operations.

The petitioner has to stop the mining operations at once, and on February 19, 1997, a decision was taken after meeting all the trade unions to declare lay-off from February 19, 1997. The Government of India, Ministry of Labour, by letter, dated April 5, 1997, rejected the petitioner's request for exemption from the applicability of Section 25-M as the petitioner was carrying and without prior permission of the Government of India before application.

The first respondent by communication, dated April 15, 1997, directed the petitioner to submit a fresh application seeking permission of the Government for the period of lay-off already declared as even prior to the order of the Supreme Court, the mining was carried without prior consent of the Government of India. The petitioner once again submitted a fresh application setting out various details under Section 25-M of the Industrial Disputes Act on May 9, 1997. The order impugned in W.P. No. 12998 of 1997 is quashed.
