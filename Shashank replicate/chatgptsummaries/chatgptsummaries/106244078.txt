In a recent court order, a petitioner who was facing prosecution under the Wild Life Protection Act for injuring a deer while driving his car has been acquitted. The court has quashed the prosecution, stating that the injury was not voluntarily inflicted and did not amount to hunting as defined under the law. The deer was hit on a public road and the petitioner had no control over the situation. The case has been dismissed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products.
