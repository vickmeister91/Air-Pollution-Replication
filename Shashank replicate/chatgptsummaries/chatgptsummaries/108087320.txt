The Jharkhand High Court recently allowed an application for amendment of reliefs sought by the petitioner in a criminal case. The petitioner had filed a plea for quashing the criminal proceedings against him, including the FIR, for offences punishable under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner claimed that he was the owner of the vehicle and could not be held responsible for the offences committed by the driver.

The court referred to a Supreme Court judgment and held that the police had the power to investigate the case under the Indian Penal Code, and the magistrate was empowered to take cognizance. The court also noted that Section 22 of the MMDR Act precluded the court from taking cognizance of any offence punishable under the Act except upon a complaint made in writing by a person authorized by the Central or State Government.

The court order further stated that no first information report can be filed for offences under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, as the definition of a complaint in Section 2(d) of the Criminal Procedure Code excludes a police report. The Assistant Sub-Inspector of police who filed the FIR for the offences punishable under Section 4(i) of the MMDR Act did not have the jurisdiction to do so.

However, the order taking cognizance for the offence punishable under Sections 379/411 of the Indian Penal Code does not warrant any interference, and the trial shall proceed accordingly. The prosecution of the petitioner under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 cannot be allowed to continue as the necessary requirements under Section 43 of the Act have not been fulfilled. The order taking cognizance for the offence under Section 21 of the Air Act is also quashed.
