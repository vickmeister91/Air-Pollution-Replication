The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Beant Singh and Krishan Kumar, who were challenging an order passed by the Special Judge in a drug case. The judge had rejected their application to send a control sample for further chemical analysis to the Forensic Science Laboratory. The judge had cited a notification issued by the Central Government in 2009, which stated that the total quantity of the manufactured or mixed substance would be considered a psychotropic substance and not just the fraction of the psychotropic substance that had been mixed.

The recovery in the case had been made in 2011, and the application was filed almost five years later. The court found no infirmity or illegality in the order passed by the trial court and dismissed the petition.

The case in question involved the recovery of a substance that was suspected to be a psychotropic substance. The substance was recovered in 2011, and the accused were charged with possession of a psychotropic substance. During the trial, the accused had requested that a control sample be sent for further chemical analysis to the Forensic Science Laboratory. However, the trial court had rejected their application, citing a notification issued by the Central Government in 2009.

The notification stated that the total quantity of the manufactured or mixed substance would be considered a psychotropic substance and not just the fraction of the psychotropic substance that had been mixed. The accused had argued that the notification was not applicable in their case, as the substance recovered from them was not a psychotropic substance. However, the trial court had rejected their argument and had held that the notification was applicable in their case.

The accused had then filed a petition challenging the order passed by the trial court. They had argued that the notification was not applicable in their case, as the substance recovered from them was not a psychotropic substance. They had also argued that the trial court had erred in rejecting their application to send a control sample for further chemical analysis to the Forensic Science Laboratory.

However, the court found no infirmity or illegality in the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the notification was applicable in the case, as the substance recovered from the accused was a mixed substance. The court also held that the trial court had not erred in rejecting the application to send a control sample for further chemical analysis to the Forensic Science Laboratory.

The court observed that the recovery in the case had been made in 2011, and the application was filed almost five years later. The court held that the delay in filing the application was not justified, and the accused had failed to provide any valid reason for the delay. The court also observed that the accused had not challenged the notification issued by the Central Government in 2009, and had only challenged its applicability in their case.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Beant Singh and Krishan Kumar, and upheld the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the notification issued by the Central Government in 2009 was applicable in the case, and the trial court had not erred in rejecting the application to send a control sample for further chemical analysis to the Forensic Science Laboratory. The court also observed that the delay in filing the application was not justified, and the accused had failed to provide any valid reason for the delay.
