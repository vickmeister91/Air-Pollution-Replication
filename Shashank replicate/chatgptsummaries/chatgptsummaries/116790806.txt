The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued two court orders related to mining and pollution control. The first order pertains to the renewal of a mining lease, while the second order deals with the rejection of an application for consent to carry out manufacturing activities due to the failure to submit a valid mining lease.

In the first order, the court directed the State Government to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of lease within eight weeks, as per Rule 24-A of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. The court also considered the issue of the Pollution Control Board rejecting the petitioner's application for consent to carry out manufacturing activities due to the failure to submit a valid mining lease.

The petitioner had submitted an application to the Pollution Control Board, stating that the lease was deemed to have been extended until the State Government passes an order on the renewal application. The court directed the Pollution Control Board to reconsider the application after the submission of a valid mining lease.

The second order pertains to the operation of a mine without valid consent, which is a violation of Water/Air Acts. The court stated that the mine management failed to submit a valid mining lease and their application will only be reconsidered after submitting the required information. The Pollution Control Board is directed to reconsider the application and take a final decision within two weeks.

Until then, the petitioner can continue with operations on the same terms and conditions as specified by the Pollution Control Board. The court left all questions to be decided by the Pollution Control Board and the petitioner can challenge the final decision in appropriate proceedings.

The court's orders highlight the importance of complying with mining and pollution control regulations. The renewal of a mining lease is subject to certain rules and regulations, and failure to comply with these rules can result in the rejection of applications for consent to carry out manufacturing activities.

The court's orders also emphasize the role of the Pollution Control Board in ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. The Board has the power to reject applications for consent to carry out manufacturing activities if the applicant fails to comply with environmental regulations.

Overall, the court's orders serve as a reminder to mining companies and other industries to comply with environmental regulations and obtain the necessary permits and approvals before carrying out any activities that may have an impact on the environment. Failure to do so can result in legal action and penalties.
