The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal in Bangalore recently issued a final order in the case of M/S Koeleman India (P) Ltd vs Commissioner Of Central Excise. The case involved a dispute over whether the appellant was entitled to a refund of CENVAT credit of service tax paid on banking charges, installation of effluent treatment plant, and insurance service. The lower authorities had denied the refund claim, but the tribunal allowed the refund claim in respect of banking charges and effluent treatment plant, as they were considered essential input services and were covered by previous judgments. However, the refund claim for insurance service was not allowed.

The case centered around the interpretation of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, which allow manufacturers and service providers to claim credit for the service tax paid on input services used in the production or provision of goods or services. The appellant, M/S Koeleman India (P) Ltd, had claimed a refund of service tax paid on banking charges, installation of effluent treatment plant, and insurance service, which it argued were essential input services used in the manufacture of its products.

The lower authorities had denied the refund claim on the grounds that banking charges and insurance service were not essential input services, and that the installation of effluent treatment plant did not qualify as an input service. However, the tribunal disagreed with this interpretation and allowed the refund claim in respect of banking charges and effluent treatment plant.

The tribunal held that banking charges were an essential input service as they were directly related to the manufacturing process. The appellant had argued that it needed to maintain a current account with the bank to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and payment of wages to its employees. The tribunal agreed with this argument and held that the service tax paid on banking charges was eligible for refund.

Similarly, the tribunal held that the installation of effluent treatment plant was an essential input service as it was necessary for the appellant to comply with environmental regulations. The appellant had argued that it was required to install the effluent treatment plant to treat the waste generated during the manufacturing process, and that the service tax paid on the installation of the plant was eligible for refund. The tribunal agreed with this argument and allowed the refund claim in respect of the installation of effluent treatment plant.

However, the tribunal did not allow the refund claim for insurance service. The appellant had argued that it was required to take out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to its plant and machinery, and that the service tax paid on the insurance premiums was eligible for refund. However, the tribunal held that insurance service did not qualify as an essential input service as it was not directly related to the manufacturing process.

In conclusion, the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal in Bangalore allowed the refund claim of M/S Koeleman India (P) Ltd in respect of banking charges and installation of effluent treatment plant, but denied the refund claim for insurance service. The tribunal held that banking charges and effluent treatment plant were essential input services and were covered by previous judgments, while insurance service did not qualify as an essential input service. This case highlights the importance of understanding the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, and the criteria for claiming credit for service tax paid on input services.
