The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Mukesh Mahra under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence punishable under sections 5, 9, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The allegation against the applicant is that he, along with other co-accused, has been found in possession of leopard skin. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs. 50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The order also lists eight conditions that the applicant must comply with, failing which the bail will be cancelled. These conditions include that the applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer; that he shall not leave India without the prior permission of the court; that he shall not tamper with the evidence or attempt to influence any witness; that he shall attend the trial court on all the dates of hearing and shall not delay the trial in any manner; that he shall surrender his passport, if any, to the trial court; that he shall not commit any offence while on bail; that he shall not change his residence without prior permission of the trial court; and that he shall furnish his mobile number and email ID to the trial court and keep them operational at all times.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors. Firstly, the court has taken into account the fact that the applicant has no criminal antecedents and has cooperated with the investigation. Secondly, the court has noted that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that the trial is likely to take some time to conclude. Thirdly, the court has considered the fact that the offence in question is bailable and that the applicant is entitled to bail as a matter of right, subject to the conditions imposed by the court.

However, the court has also taken note of the seriousness of the offence and the need to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or tamper with the evidence. Hence, the court has imposed several conditions on the applicant to ensure that he complies with the terms of his bail and does not interfere with the trial in any manner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Mukesh Mahra under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence punishable under sections 5, 9, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs. 50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.
