The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by the Millennium Habitat Owners Association against the Member Secretary of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Habitat Splendour Owners Association, and Gopalan Enterprises. The petitioner had sought to quash an order refusing consent by the respondent and the orders of the appellate authority.

The court observed that an alternative remedy under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was available to the petitioner. The court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy before approaching the High Court. The court, therefore, disposed of the petition, leaving it open for the petitioner to take recourse to appropriate remedies in accordance with the law.

The case pertains to the construction of a residential complex called Habitat Splendour by Gopalan Enterprises. The Millennium Habitat Owners Association had filed a complaint with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board alleging that the construction was causing environmental pollution. The Board had conducted an inspection and found that the construction was in violation of environmental norms. The Board, therefore, refused to grant consent for the construction.

Gopalan Enterprises had challenged this order before the appellate authority, which had upheld the Board's decision. The Millennium Habitat Owners Association had also filed an appeal before the appellate authority, seeking to enhance the compensation awarded to them for the damage caused by the construction. The appellate authority had dismissed this appeal as well.

The Millennium Habitat Owners Association had then approached the High Court by way of a writ petition. The petitioner had contended that the construction was causing environmental pollution and that the Board had rightly refused to grant consent. The petitioner had also challenged the orders of the appellate authority.

The High Court, however, noted that the petitioner had not exhausted the alternative remedy available to them under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. This section provides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal to deal with environmental disputes. The court observed that the petitioner could have approached the Tribunal instead of approaching the High Court directly.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the orders of the appellate authority before the Tribunal. The court, therefore, held that the petitioner had not exhausted the available remedies before approaching the High Court. The court, therefore, disposed of the petition, leaving it open for the petitioner to take recourse to appropriate remedies in accordance with the law.

The judgment highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the High Court. The court has emphasized that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, provides for an alternative remedy for environmental disputes. The court has also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the orders of the appellate authority before the Tribunal. This highlights the need for parties to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the High Court.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court has disposed of a writ petition filed by the Millennium Habitat Owners Association against the Member Secretary of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Habitat Splendour Owners Association, and Gopalan Enterprises. The court has observed that an alternative remedy under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was available to the petitioner and disposed of the petition, leaving it open for the petitioner to take recourse to appropriate remedies in accordance with the law. The judgment highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the High Court and the need for parties to approach the National Green Tribunal for environmental disputes.
