The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Om Prakash Mishra, also known as O.P. Mishra, under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The petition seeks to quash the criminal proceedings against Mishra in connection with a case filed under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court has issued a notice to the second opposite party and stayed further proceedings until the rule is made returnable within 16 weeks. This means that the court has put a hold on any further action in the case until the rule is made returnable, which is a legal term that refers to the date on which the court will hear arguments and make a decision on the matter.

In addition, the court has called for the Lower Court Record (LCR) from the concerned court. The LCR is a document that contains all the relevant information and records related to the case, and it will be used by the court to make a decision on the petition.

The court has also ordered a copy of the order to be sent to the concerned court through FAX at the cost deposited by the petitioner. This means that the petitioner will have to pay for the cost of sending a copy of the order to the concerned court via FAX.

Overall, the court order is significant because it puts a hold on the criminal proceedings against Mishra and calls for the LCR from the concerned court. This suggests that the court is taking the petition seriously and will carefully consider all the relevant information before making a decision on the matter.
