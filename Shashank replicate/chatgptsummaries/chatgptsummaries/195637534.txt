The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently heard an appeal by M/s. Gujarat Eco Textile Park Limited against the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Expert Appraisal Committee's decision to deny permission to accept membership of industrial units operating outside the park for treatment of effluents generated from their units. The EAC had declined the proposal on the grounds that the industrial units located outside the park were already members of another Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) under construction.

The appellant argued that the CETP under construction was not operational and that the industrial units were facing difficulties in disposing of their effluents. The appellant also contended that the CETP under construction was not designed to treat the specific type of effluents generated by the industrial units outside the park.

The NGT found the decision of the EAC to be arbitrary and without substantial reason. The court noted that the EAC had not considered the fact that the CETP under construction was not operational and that the industrial units were facing difficulties in disposing of their effluents. The court also observed that the EAC had not considered the fact that the CETP under construction was not designed to treat the specific type of effluents generated by the industrial units outside the park.

The NGT quashed the decision of the EAC and directed the respondents to allow the amendment to the Environmental Clearance (EC) as sought by the appellant. The court also directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs towards the cost of the proceedings.

The NGT's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case while making decisions related to environmental clearances. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for proper planning and coordination while setting up CETPs to ensure that they are designed to treat the specific type of effluents generated by the industrial units in the area.

The NGT's decision is also in line with the government's efforts to promote sustainable development and ensure that industrial activities do not have a negative impact on the environment. The government has been taking several measures to regulate industrial activities and ensure that they comply with environmental norms and standards.

In conclusion, the NGT's decision in the case of M/s. Gujarat Eco Textile Park Limited highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case while making decisions related to environmental clearances. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for proper planning and coordination while setting up CETPs to ensure that they are designed to treat the specific type of effluents generated by the industrial units in the area. The decision is significant as it promotes sustainable development and ensures that industrial activities do not have a negative impact on the environment.
