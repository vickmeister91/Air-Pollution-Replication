The issue of plastic waste and its impact on the environment and human health has been a growing concern in India. In response to this, the Government of Tamil Nadu issued a notification in June 2018, banning the manufacture, storage, supply, sale, and use of one-time use and throwaway plastics, irrespective of thickness, with effect from January 1, 2019, under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The ban includes plastic carry bags, plastic sheets used for food wrapping, plastic plates, plastic coated tea cups, plastic tumblers, water pouches and packets, plastic straws, and plastic flags. Certain exemptions have been made for plastic used for specific purposes. The ban is aimed at preventing environmental damage and health hazards caused by plastic waste.

Several court orders have been issued in relation to the implementation of this ban. In one such order, a petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to implement the government order banning the use of plastic bags and other plastic products in shops and to take action against those who violate the ban. The petitioner argued that the use of plastic bags and other plastic products is harmful to human health and the environment. The court heard the petitioner's arguments and reviewed the materials on record. However, the court did not issue a ruling in the summary provided.

Another court order was addressed to various government officials in Tamil Nadu regarding the production and use of banned plastic goods and covers. The petitioner provided evidence of the continued production and use of these items despite the ban. The petitioner argued that the use of plastic is harmful to the environment and human health and requested that serious action be taken against those who violate the ban. The court order cited the government order from June 2018 that prohibits the production and distribution of one-time use plastic goods and covers.

In yet another court order, titled "Specifications for 'Compostable Plastics'", the storage, supply, transport, sale, distribution, and use of plastic items that contain high polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, vinyl, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene resins, multi-materials like acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyphenylene oxide, polycarbonate, and polybutylene terephthalate were prohibited. The order defined "use and throwaway plastic" as items such as plastic carry bags, plastic sheets used for food wrapping, plastic plates, plastic coated tea cups and plastic tumblers, water pouches and packets, plastic straw irrespective of thickness. The order also defined "compostable plastic" as plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials, excluding conventional petro-based plastics, and does not leave visible, distinguishable, or toxic residue. The order imposed fines and other penalties for violations of the ban.

In another court order, the validity of G.O.(Ms).No.84, Environment and Forests (EC.2) Department, dated 25.06.2018, which prohibits the use and throwaway plastic in Tamil Nadu, was confirmed. The court dismissed several writ petitions attempting to quash the order and stated that the government has the power to impose total prohibition/closure of industries under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court also noted that the ban only applies to use and throwaway plastic and there are exemptions for certain types of plastic. The government is effectively implementing the order, and an action taken report has been submitted as part of the record.

Finally, in another court order, a writ petition was dismissed, but the government was suggested to consider phasing out all kinds of plastic in the market before the end of 2019. The court also noted that there is no need to issue repeated directions for the implementation of the government order on banning plastic, and that the petitioner can bring any grievances to the attention of the authorities. The writ petition was disposed of with no costs. The order was addressed to various government officials.

In conclusion, the issue of plastic waste and its impact on the environment and human health is a growing concern in India. The Government of Tamil Nadu has taken steps to address this issue by issuing a notification banning the manufacture, storage, supply, sale, and use of one-time use and throwaway plastics. Several court orders have been issued in relation to the implementation of this ban, confirming its validity and imposing fines and penalties for violations. The government has been suggested to consider phasing out all kinds of plastic in the market before the end of 2019. The court has also noted that the petitioner can bring any grievances to the attention of the authorities.
