The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by different groups of petitioners against the State of Maharashtra and various government officials. The issue at hand is the rehabilitation of families affected by the declaration of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. The government had offered compensation packages of Rs. 10 lakhs per family, but the petitioners claim that some widows have not received any compensation. The court is hearing both petitions together and has issued an oral judgment.

The first writ petition filed by the petitioners is related to the rehabilitation of families affected by the declaration of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. The government had offered compensation packages of Rs. 10 lakhs per family, but the petitioners claim that some widows have not received any compensation. The petitioners argue that they are entitled to compensation as a separate family unit, while the respondents argue that they have already been compensated as part of their respective family units.

The court has heard both petitions together and has issued an oral judgment. The court finds that the term "family" in the government resolution includes widows residing with their family units and that the petitioners have already been compensated as part of their respective family units. The court also notes that the communication recommending separate compensation for widows does not create any right in favor of the petitioners.

The second writ petition filed by the petitioners is related to the same issue of compensation for widows. The petitioners argue that they are entitled to compensation as a separate family unit, while the respondents argue that they have already been compensated as part of their respective family units. The court finds that the definition of "family" in the relevant government resolution includes a major son. The court also notes that the petitioners are not entitled to any relief as they do not constitute separate family units and have already received compensation. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by different groups of petitioners against the State of Maharashtra and various government officials.
