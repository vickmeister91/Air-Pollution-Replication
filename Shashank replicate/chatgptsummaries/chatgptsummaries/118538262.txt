The Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Srinagar recently heard a case regarding the selection process for 98 Prosecuting Officers. The written examination process was challenged on the grounds that questions were out of syllabus, syllabus was not strictly adhered to, and marks allocation was irrational. The court examined the syllabus and the evaluation process and found that the selection process was fair and transparent. The court also dismissed the argument that question No.4 was wrongly formulated.

The court order discusses objections raised by petitioners regarding the selection process for a legal position in Jammu and Kashmir. The objections include questions being out of syllabus, wrong options for answers, and wrong formulation of questions. The court rejects most of the objections and states that it is not appropriate to interfere with the selection process at this stage. However, the petitioners are allowed to re-agitate if any valid ground becomes available later. The court order also refers to a judgment from the High Court of Orissa, which is not applicable to this case.
