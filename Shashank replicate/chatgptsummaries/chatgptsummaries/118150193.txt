The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has been ordered by the court to not issue any final notification regarding the eco-sensitive zone until further orders. This order was made in response to allegations made by the petitioner that the notification was issued based on a proposal sent by the State Government and that the covered area was reduced to 1,14,000 hectares only. The court has given time to the learned Assistant Government Pleader to obtain instructions in the matter and notice is returnable on 3.5.2017.

The issue at hand is the notification of an eco-sensitive zone, which is an area around a protected area that is regulated to prevent any ecological damage. The petitioner has alleged that the notification was issued based on a proposal sent by the State Government, which may not have taken into account all the necessary factors. Additionally, the covered area was reduced to 1,14,000 hectares only, which may not be sufficient to protect the environment adequately.

The court has taken cognizance of these allegations and has ordered that no final notification shall be issued until further orders. This is a significant development as it shows that the court is taking the issue of environmental protection seriously and is willing to intervene to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to protect the environment.

The court has also given time to the learned Assistant Government Pleader to obtain instructions in the matter. This is a positive step as it shows that the court is willing to listen to both sides of the argument and is not rushing to make a decision without considering all the relevant factors.

The notice is returnable on 3.5.2017, which means that the matter will be heard again on that date. This is an important date as it will give both sides an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence before the court. It is hoped that this hearing will lead to a resolution of the issue and that the necessary steps will be taken to protect the environment.

In conclusion, the court has ordered that no final notification shall be issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change regarding the eco-sensitive zone until further orders. This is in response to allegations made by the petitioner that the notification was issued based on a proposal sent by the State Government and that the covered area was reduced to 1,14,000 hectares only. The court has given time to the learned Assistant Government Pleader to obtain instructions in the matter and notice is returnable on 3.5.2017.
