The first court order pertains to a case where a complainant alleged that a company was running an illegal industrial unit in a residential area without obtaining consent from the DPCC or any other authority. The complainant also alleged that the company was causing air pollution by using a steam generator without permission and extracting groundwater without permission. Initially, the court declined cognizance of the case, but later took it up and found the accused prima facie liable for violating section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, which is punishable under section 15 of the same act. The accused were summoned to face trial.

The second court order spans across pages 10 to 16, but without any context or information about the case, it is impossible to provide a summary of the order.
