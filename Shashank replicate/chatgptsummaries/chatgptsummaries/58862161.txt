The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Manjeet Sethi against HDFC Bank. The petitioner had filed an application under section 91 Cr.PC seeking directions to the respondent to produce all the records of correspondence between the complainant bank and the petitioner with respect to the complaint. The application was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that if such correspondence has taken place between the parties, a copy of the same must have been available with the petitioner.

The petitioner, Manjeet Sethi, had filed a complaint against HDFC Bank, alleging that the bank had illegally debited an amount from her account. In response to this complaint, the petitioner had sought directions from the court to the respondent to produce all the records of correspondence between the complainant bank and the petitioner with respect to the complaint. The petitioner had argued that the production of these records was necessary to establish the veracity of her complaint.

However, the trial court dismissed the application on the ground that if such correspondence had taken place between the parties, a copy of the same must have been available with the petitioner. The court observed that the accused/applicant/petitioner had failed to specify the exact document/record sought to be produced by way of present application and relevancy thereof with the subject matter of the complaint. The court dismissed the application, stating that the production of documents did not appear to be necessary or desirable.

The petitioner then filed a revision petition before the High Court, challenging the order of the trial court. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, upheld the order of the trial court. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to establish the necessity of the production of the documents sought by her. The court further observed that the petitioner had not specified the exact document/record sought to be produced and its relevancy with the subject matter of the complaint.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents from the bank before filing the application under section 91 Cr.PC. The court observed that the petitioner had not even made a request to the bank for the production of the documents. The court held that the petitioner had failed to establish the necessity of the production of the documents sought by her and that the trial court had rightly dismissed the application.
