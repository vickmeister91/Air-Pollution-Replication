In a recent court order, Smt. Yashoda Devi filed a petition seeking eviction of Sh. Heera Lal from a room that she had let out to him for residential purposes. The petitioner claimed that she had inherited the property from her late husband and had a bonafide requirement for the same. She also stated that the respondent had no alternative accommodation and that the property was not let out for commercial purposes. The respondent contested the petition, claiming that the petitioner had sufficient accommodation and that the property was let out for commercial purposes.

After hearing both parties, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, stating that she had proved ownership and purpose of letting, and that she had a bonafide requirement for the property. The respondent's claim of sufficient accommodation was dismissed, and the court ordered eviction of the respondent. The court order clearly stated that the petitioner had no alternative accommodation available for herself and her family members, and the respondent had failed to provide any alternative accommodation for the petitioner.

The court order also revealed that the petitioner needed at least 12 rooms for her family members, but she only had seven rooms available. The court passed an eviction order in favor of the petitioner, but she cannot execute it before six months from the date of the order.
