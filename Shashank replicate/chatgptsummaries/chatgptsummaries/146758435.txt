The court order pertains to multiple bail applications filed by Afjal Baig, who is accused of large-scale poaching of elephants in Odisha for ivory trade. The petitioner has been denied bail in all three cases, as he is believed to be the mastermind behind the crimes and has made a huge profit from illegal trading. The court highlights the importance of protecting elephants, which are considered to be nature's unique masterpiece and worshipped as a form of Lord Ganesha in India. Despite an increase in the elephant population in Odisha, large-scale poaching for ivory trade continues to be a violent and brutal crime.

In one of the cases, the accused persons confessed to hunting and killing two elephants and removing their tusks, which were later sold to the petitioner. The court provides details of this case and emphasizes the gravity of the offense. The court also notes that the investigation is ongoing and that the charge sheet submission is not a ground for granting bail.

The court order also discusses the powers of Customs Officers and Forest Officers in relation to the Indian Evidence Act. It states that while these officers have some powers similar to those of police officers, they are not considered police officers under the Act. Therefore, statements made to them can be admissible as evidence in court. The order cites several cases to support this interpretation of the law.

Another aspect of the court order pertains to the admissibility of confessional statements made by co-accused persons in a forest offense case. The court concludes that confessional statements recorded by forest officials are admissible in evidence and there is no legal bar in acting on such confessions. The merit of such evidence can be adjudicated at the stage of trial. The court cites previous cases to support its decision and emphasizes that the validity of such statements can be tested by the defense.

The court also criticizes a Sessions Judge for granting pre-arrest bail to a petitioner based solely on the confessional statement of a co-accused, without considering the possibility of more evidence being collected by the investigating agency. The order emphasizes that while confessional statements can be considered during bail hearings, a detailed examination of evidence should be avoided. The court denies bail to the petitioner based on prima facie evidence of criminal conspiracy and illegal trading of tusks, as well as the petitioner's criminal antecedents and involvement in similar cases.

In another case, the petitioner's lawyer argued that other co-accused persons had been released on bail and that there was no evidence linking the petitioner to the crime. The state's lawyer argued that the petitioner was the mastermind behind the crime and that the investigation was ongoing. The court considered the confessional statements of co-accused persons, but ultimately concluded that the statements were not admissible as evidence against the petitioner. The court denied the petitioner's request for bail.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the gravity of wildlife crimes, particularly those related to elephant poaching and illegal trade of wildlife trophies. The court highlights the importance of protecting elephants, which are considered to be a unique masterpiece of nature and worshipped as a form of Lord Ganesha in India. The court also provides guidance on the admissibility of evidence in forest offense cases and emphasizes the need for a detailed examination of evidence before granting bail.
