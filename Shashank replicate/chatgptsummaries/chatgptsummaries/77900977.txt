The Telangana High Court recently received a petition from M/s. Kosher Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, which challenged the legality of a closure notice issued by the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner claimed that they were not given an opportunity to be heard before the notice was issued. However, the court found that the Pollution Control Board has the power to issue closure notices without prior notice if pollution is being caused to a great extent that would endanger human life.

The court directed the Pollution Control Board to give the petitioner a post-decisional hearing and sufficient time to rectify the defects present in the functioning of the unit and comply with the requirements of the law. This decision highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the Pollution Control Board in ensuring that industries comply with the law.
