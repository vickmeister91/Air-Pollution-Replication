The Bombay High Court recently passed a judgment in a case filed by Tata Power Company Limited and others challenging an assessment order by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The petitioners argued that the order was contrary to the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court referred to a previous judgment by the Supreme Court and observed that the notification dated 16th April, 1993, which was involved in the present case, could not be sustained since the Central Government had not complied with the provisions of section 16(2) of the Act. The court held that the notification not only had to be placed before the House of Parliament but also had to be approved by it. Since no such resolution was moved before the Parliament, the assessment order was quashed and set aside.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons carrying on certain industries and by local authorities, with a view to augment the resources of the Central Board and the State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of the Central Board and the State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act also provides for the appointment of officers and other employees of the Boards, their powers and functions, and the procedure for the levy and collection of the cess.

The present case pertains to a notification dated 16th April, 1993, issued by the Central Government under section 16(1) of the Act. The notification provided for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons carrying on certain industries and by local authorities. The notification also provided for the manner of calculation of the cess and the procedure for its payment. The petitioners challenged the assessment order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board on the ground that the notification was ultra vires the Act.

The court referred to a previous judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. v. State of Kerala and observed that the notification dated 16th April, 1993, could not be sustained since the Central Government had not complied with the provisions of section 16(2) of the Act. The court held that the notification not only had to be placed before the House of Parliament but also had to be approved by it. Since no such resolution was moved before the Parliament, the assessment order was quashed and set aside.

The court also observed that the provisions of section 16(2) of the Act were mandatory and not directory. The court held that the Central Government had no power to issue a notification under section 16(1) of the Act without complying with the provisions of section 16(2) of the Act. The court further held that the assessment order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board was based on the notification dated 16th April, 1993, which was ultra vires the Act. Therefore, the assessment order was quashed and set aside.

The court also observed that the petitioners had challenged the assessment order on the ground that it was contrary to the provisions of the Act.
