The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Santu Gupta and Uttam Choudhary in connection with a case filed against them under Sections 379 of the Indian Penal Code, Rule 54 of the Jharkhand Minor Mineral Concession Rule, 2004, and Section 15 of the Pollution Control Act, 1986. The court directed the petitioners to surrender in court within three weeks and granted bail on a bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The court ordered the office to communicate the order immediately.

The case against Gupta and Choudhary was filed after they were accused of stealing minerals from a mine in Jharkhand. The case also alleged that they had violated pollution control laws by not properly disposing of waste materials from the mine. The two men had been on the run since the case was filed, and had sought anticipatory bail from the court to avoid arrest.
