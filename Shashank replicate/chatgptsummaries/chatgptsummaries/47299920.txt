In a recent court order, three individuals challenged the proceedings initiated against them for offenses punishable under Sections 171 (E) and (F) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The petitioners argued that the offenses were non-cognizable and that the learned Magistrate had granted permission without applying his mind. 

Upon examination of the case, the court found that the Magistrate had endorsed the permission without recording reasons, which is not a speaking order. A speaking order is an order that contains reasons for the decision taken by the court. The court noted that the Magistrate had not applied his mind while granting permission for the proceedings against the petitioners. 

The court observed that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The court emphasized that the right to a fair trial includes the right to be heard and the right to a reasoned decision. The court held that the Magistrate's order was not a reasoned decision and therefore violated the petitioners' right to a fair trial. 

The court further noted that the Magistrate's order was not in compliance with the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The CrPC requires that a Magistrate record reasons for granting permission for proceedings against an accused. The court held that the Magistrate's failure to record reasons for granting permission was a violation of the CrPC. 

Based on these observations, the court allowed the petitions and quashed all proceedings against the petitioners in the case. The court's decision was based on the principle that a fair trial is a fundamental right and that the Magistrate's failure to record reasons for granting permission violated this right. 

This court order highlights the importance of a speaking order in legal proceedings. A speaking order is an order that contains reasons for the decision taken by the court. A speaking order is essential to ensure that the right to a fair trial is upheld. The right to a fair trial is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India. 

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of compliance with the CrPC. The CrPC is a procedural law that governs criminal proceedings in India. Compliance with the CrPC is essential to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected and that justice is served. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of a speaking order and compliance with the CrPC. The court's decision upholds the fundamental right to a fair trial and ensures that justice is served.
