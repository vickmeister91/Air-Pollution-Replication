The case in question involves a petitioner who was accused of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The petitioner had filed a petition seeking the production of seven documents, out of which five were produced by the respondent and the other two were not available. The lower court dismissed the petition in respect of those two documents, and the petitioner challenged this decision.

The petitioner's argument was that the lower court should have directed the respondent to produce the two missing documents, as they were crucial to the case. The High Court, however, dismissed the Criminal Original Petition, stating that the lower court cannot be expected to issue a direction for the production of documents that are not in the hands of the respondent.

The High Court's decision was based on the fact that the lower court had already directed the respondent to produce all the documents that were in their possession. The court noted that the lower court had no power to compel the production of documents that were not in the respondent's possession.

The High Court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the missing documents from any other source. The court stated that the petitioner could have approached the relevant authorities to obtain the documents, but had failed to do so.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to suggest that the missing documents were crucial to the case. The court noted that the petitioner had not explained how the missing documents would have affected the outcome of the case.

In light of these observations, the High Court dismissed the petitioner's appeal. The court held that the lower court had acted within its jurisdiction in dismissing the petition in respect of the missing documents.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court. It also underscores the fact that courts can only act within their jurisdiction and cannot compel the production of documents that are not in the possession of the respondent.
