The State of Rajasthan had filed an appeal against the acquittal of Saroopbhai Rana and another person by a Judicial Magistrate for illegally constructing a hotel on forest land. The State had argued that the accused had committed offences under the Forest Conservation Act and the Rajasthan Forest Act. However, the High Court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the land belonged to the Forest Department and that the tools recovered from the accused could be used for other purposes. Therefore, the Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the acquittal.

The case revolved around the illegal construction of a hotel on forest land. The State of Rajasthan had alleged that the accused had violated the Forest Conservation Act and the Rajasthan Forest Act by constructing the hotel on forest land without obtaining the necessary permissions. The State had also alleged that the accused had used tools that were meant for cutting trees and clearing the land.

The Judicial Magistrate had acquitted the accused on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove that the land belonged to the Forest Department. The Magistrate had also noted that the tools recovered from the accused could be used for other purposes and that there was no evidence to suggest that they were used for cutting trees or clearing the land.

The State of Rajasthan had filed an appeal against the acquittal in the High Court. The State had argued that the Magistrate had erred in acquitting the accused and that the evidence on record clearly showed that the accused had violated the Forest Conservation Act and the Rajasthan Forest Act.

The High Court, however, found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the land belonged to the Forest Department. The Court noted that the prosecution had not produced any documents to show that the land was forest land and that the Forest Department had any rights over it. The Court also observed that the accused had produced documents to show that they had obtained permission from the Revenue Department to construct the hotel on the land.

The High Court also noted that the tools recovered from the accused could be used for other purposes and that there was no evidence to suggest that they were used for cutting trees or clearing the land. The Court observed that the prosecution had not produced any witnesses to prove that the accused had used the tools for illegal purposes.

In light of these findings, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the State of Rajasthan and upheld the acquittal of the accused. The Court held that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused were entitled to the benefit of doubt.
