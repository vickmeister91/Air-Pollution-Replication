The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Shree Bala Ji Stone Crusher Company, which sought direction from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to grant consent to establish/No Objection Certificate to their unit. The petitioner's counsel informed the court that the necessary consent had already been granted, rendering the petition infructuous. As a result, the court dismissed the petition as withdrawn.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and clearances before setting up any industrial unit. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board is responsible for ensuring that industrial units comply with environmental regulations and do not cause harm to the environment or public health. In this case, the petitioner had sought permission to establish their stone crusher unit, and it appears that they were able to obtain the necessary consent from the pollution control board.

However, it is important to note that obtaining consent to establish is just the first step in setting up an industrial unit. The petitioner would also need to obtain other clearances and permissions, such as a No Objection Certificate from the local authorities, before commencing operations. Failure to obtain these clearances can result in legal action and penalties.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition as withdrawn indicates that the petitioner was able to resolve the issue without the need for further legal intervention. It is unclear why the petitioner had filed the petition in the first place, given that they had already obtained the necessary consent. It is possible that they were seeking some additional relief or clarification from the court, but this is not clear from the available information.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary clearances and permissions before setting up any industrial unit. It also underscores the role of the courts in ensuring that such regulations are enforced and that industrial units operate in a manner that is safe and sustainable.
