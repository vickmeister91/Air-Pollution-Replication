The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Srikant Processors Pvt. Ltd. and others challenging an order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Pali, rejecting their revision against an order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate (First Class), Pali. The petitioners had filed an application under Section 91 CrPC to summon certain books of accounts from the complainant respondent, which was rejected by the trial court. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the trial court was justified in rejecting the application filed by the accused and that there was no infirmity, illegality or abuse of process of court being reflected in the impugned orders so as to warrant interference by exercising inherent powers of this court under Section 482 CrPC. The trial court was directed to conclude the trial expeditiously.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to first understand the background of the case. Srikant Processors Pvt. Ltd. and others had filed a petition challenging an order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Pali, rejecting their revision against an order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate (First Class), Pali. The petitioners had filed an application under Section 91 CrPC to summon certain books of accounts from the complainant respondent, which was rejected by the trial court.

The petitioners had argued that the books of accounts were necessary to prove their innocence in the case. However, the trial court had rejected their application, stating that the books of accounts were not relevant to the case and that the petitioners had failed to establish their relevance.

The petitioners had then filed a revision petition before the Sessions Court, which was also rejected. They had then approached the High Court, seeking relief under Section 482 CrPC.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court observed that the trial court was justified in rejecting the application filed by the accused and that there was no infirmity, illegality or abuse of process of court being reflected in the impugned orders so as to warrant interference by exercising inherent powers of this court under Section 482 CrPC.
