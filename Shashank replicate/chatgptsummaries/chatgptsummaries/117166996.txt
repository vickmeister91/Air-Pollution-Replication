The case in question involves allegations of violating the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The petitioners had approached the court seeking anticipatory bail, as they were apprehending their arrest in connection with the case. The court granted them anticipatory bail, subject to certain conditions.

One of the conditions of the bail is that the petitioners must deposit Rs. 6,000 each in the trial court. This is a common condition in bail orders, as it ensures that the accused have some skin in the game and are less likely to abscond. The petitioners must also file an undertaking to cooperate with the investigation. This means that they must make themselves available for questioning and provide any information or documents that the investigating officer may require.

Another condition of the bail is that the petitioners must surrender their cell number and Aadhar card. This is to ensure that they do not flee or go into hiding. The investigating officer must file an application and give 72 hours' notice to the petitioners if they want to record further statements. This is to give the petitioners time to prepare and to ensure that their rights are protected.

If the petitioners fail to comply with any of the conditions of the bail, it may be cancelled. This means that they may be arrested and taken into custody. The court takes bail conditions very seriously, as they are meant to ensure that the accused cooperate with the investigation and do not abscond.

The petitioners must surrender within five weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 20,000 each with two sureties. This is another common condition in bail orders. The sureties are meant to ensure that the accused appear in court when required and do not abscond. If the accused fail to appear in court, the sureties may be forfeited.
