The Jharkhand High Court recently heard a case between Electrosteel Steels Limited and the Secretary of the Office of Lokayukta Jharkhand, Ranchi, and others. The petitioner raised a jurisdictional issue regarding the involvement of officers from the Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Board in the case. The court granted the respondents three weeks to respond to the petitioner's supplementary-affidavit and directed the petitioner to implead the State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board as Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 respectively.

The case revolves around allegations of corruption and irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks to Electrosteel Steels Limited. The petitioner had approached the Lokayukta, alleging that the company had obtained the coal blocks through fraudulent means. The Lokayukta had then initiated an investigation into the matter.

However, the petitioner had raised objections to the involvement of officers from the Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Board in the investigation. The petitioner argued that the Lokayukta did not have the jurisdiction to investigate matters related to pollution control, and that the involvement of these officers was therefore illegal.

The court, while granting the respondents three weeks to respond to the petitioner's supplementary-affidavit, directed the petitioner to implead the State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board as Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 respectively. The State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand Pollution Control Board were directed to file their necessary affidavits only to the point of jurisdiction of the learned Lokayukta.

The court also directed that the interim order granted earlier was to continue until the next hearing, which was scheduled for December 19, 2019. The interim order had earlier directed the Lokayukta to refrain from taking any coercive action against the petitioner.

The case highlights the complex jurisdictional issues that can arise in cases involving allegations of corruption and irregularities. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that investigations are conducted within the framework of the law, and that the rights of all parties involved are protected.

It remains to be seen how the case will unfold in the coming weeks, and what impact it will have on the Lokayukta's investigation into the allegations against Electrosteel Steels Limited. However, the court's decision to grant the respondents time to respond to the petitioner's supplementary-affidavit, and to direct the petitioner to implead the State of Jharkhand and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board as Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 respectively, suggests that the court is taking a cautious and considered approach to the matter.
