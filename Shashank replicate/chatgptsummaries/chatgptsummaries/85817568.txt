The court has issued three separate orders in cases related to water scarcity and misuse of water resources in Himachal Pradesh. The first case pertains to a petition filed by Sh. Rajiv Kumar against the State of Himachal Pradesh and others. The petitioner has requested the court to issue a writ of Mandamus directing the respondent department to take action against respondent No.9 for misuse of a hand pump installed in a village. The petitioner has also requested the court to issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ or order directions to the respondents department to close down the hand pump of respondent No.9 and recover commercial utilization charges from him. The court has issued notices to the respondents and impleaded the Himachal Pradesh Ground Water Authority as party respondent No.11.

In the second case, the court has directed the Executive Engineer and the State Pollution Control Board to carry out an inspection and file a report regarding a water pump causing water scarcity in a village in Himachal Pradesh. The court has also asked the Additional Chief Secretary to file an affidavit stating whether any conscious decision has been taken not to issue any notification with respect to the village. The court has examined the provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Ground Water (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2005 and concluded that there is no provision regulating the activity of pumping water by private individuals. The court has also stated that there has to be some scientific/data base for the authorities to determine whether any provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 have been violated. The court has pointed out that the scarcity of water is an issue in Himachal Pradesh and that distribution of water through public distribution systems is below the minimum norms in some districts.

The third case deals with the distribution of water through the Public Distribution System in three districts of the state, which is below the minimum norms. Private tankers are being used to distribute water in rural areas, especially due to the demand generated by the floating tourist population. The government is requested to take a decision after considering the prevalent conditions at the ground level. The government is likely to take a decision within three months. The police authorities are assured to take necessary action against the private respondent No.8. No other issue is raised. The present petition stands disposed of.

The court's orders highlight the issue of water scarcity in Himachal Pradesh and the need for proper regulation and management of water resources. The misuse of water resources by private individuals and the distribution of water through public distribution systems below the minimum norms are major concerns that need to be addressed by the government. The court has directed the concerned authorities to carry out inspections and file reports to determine the extent of the problem and take necessary action to address it.

The court has also pointed out the lack of provisions regulating the activity of pumping water by private individuals and the need for scientific/data base for the authorities to determine whether any provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 have been violated. This highlights the need for proper regulation and management of water resources to ensure their sustainable use and prevent their misuse.

The court's orders also highlight the importance of public distribution systems in ensuring access to water for all, especially in rural areas. The use of private tankers to distribute water in rural areas due to the demand generated by the floating tourist population is a major concern that needs to be addressed by the government. The court has requested the government to take a decision after considering the prevalent conditions at the ground level and assured the police authorities to take necessary action against the private respondent No.8.

In conclusion, the court's orders highlight the need for proper regulation and management of water resources in Himachal Pradesh to ensure their sustainable use and prevent their misuse. The government needs to take necessary action to address the issue of water scarcity and ensure access to water for all, especially in rural areas. The court's orders provide a roadmap for the government to address these issues and ensure the sustainable use of water resources in the state.
