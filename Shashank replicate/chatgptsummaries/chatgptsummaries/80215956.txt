Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a compensation claim filed by the family of a deceased person involved in a road accident. The first case involves Smt. Yasmeen Taj and her family, who allege that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of a motorcyclist and the improper parking of a car. The court has framed issues and heard arguments from both parties, but has not yet given a final judgment.

The second case involves a motorcyclist colliding with a scooter, resulting in the death of the scooter rider. The court found the motorcyclist and the driver of an improperly parked car responsible for the accident. The court awarded compensation to the deceased's family, including loss of dependency, funeral expenses, transportation costs, loss of consortium, and loss of love and affection. The court also ordered interest at 9% per annum from the date of the petition until the date of payment. The court held both the motorcyclist and the car owner liable for the compensation awarded.

The third case states that both drivers of the vehicles involved in the accident are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation awarded to the claimants. The negligence of the drivers is determined to be 90% on the part of the Innova Car driver and 10% on the part of the motorcycle rider. The petitioners are awarded compensation of Rs. 22,10,500 with interest, and the respondents are directed to pay the amount within three months. The order also specifies the distribution of the compensation among the petitioners and the release of the deposited amount in favor of the petitioners. Various documents and witnesses were examined during the case.

In all three cases, the court has awarded compensation to the families of the deceased, holding the responsible parties liable for the accidents. The first case is still ongoing, with no final judgment yet given. The second case awarded compensation for various expenses and held both the motorcyclist and car owner liable. The third case held both drivers jointly and severally liable, with the Innova Car driver being found more negligent than the motorcycle rider. The compensation awarded in this case was specified, along with the distribution of the amount among the petitioners.
