The Madras High Court received writ petitions from various trade unions representing plantation workers in Valparai, Anaimalai areas in Coimbatore District. The unions claimed that the Planters Association of Tamil Nadu issued notices to terminate settlements regarding wages and working conditions, which were extended automatically after the settlement period. The unions objected to the proposals and requested withdrawal, but the respondents sent notices seeking to withdraw, alter, or modify existing benefits. The court advised both parties to have bilateral negotiations to resolve issues amicably.

The court order pertains to a dispute between a plantation workers' union and the management over proposed changes in working conditions and wages. The union claims that the changes would result in a significant loss of income for workers, while the management argues that the revisions are necessary due to financial constraints faced by the industry. The court is asked to determine whether the changes can be implemented during the pendency of conciliation proceedings and whether the union has alternative remedies available. The court hears arguments from both sides and ultimately decides that the changes cannot be implemented until the conciliation process is completed and that the union does not have alternative remedies available.

The court order discusses the maintainability of a writ petition against a private company, specifically in regards to a dispute over wages and whether conciliation proceedings are pending. The court cites previous judgments to establish that a writ can be issued to a private individual or company if they violate statutory or public duties or engage in "monstrous" activities. The court also distinguishes between the obligations of employers under the Factories Act and the Industrial Disputes Act.

The court order discusses the scope and importance of the Industrial Disputes Act, which deals with the obligations, rights, and liabilities of both labor and management. The court emphasizes that disputes under this act can affect public interest and duty, and therefore, a writ can be issued against a private individual if the issue relates to a public duty or interest. The court also discusses the relevance of alternate remedies and the violation of Section 33 of the Act, which mandates that existing conditions of service shall not be altered to the disadvantage of the employee during the pendency of proceedings under the Act. The court concludes that the writ petitions are maintainable, and the judgment in VST Industries case does not affect the facts of the case.

The court order states that the employer cannot alter the existing terms of employment to the disadvantage of the workers, as it is a violation of Section 33 of the Act. The workers have the right to go on a lawful strike, but there are restrictions under Sections 22 and 23 of the Act. The management's conduct in reducing the wages without seeking permission from the authorities is unreasonable and violates the mandatory requirement of maintaining status quo. Resorting to Section 33-A of the Act is not an effective alternative remedy, and the employer cannot be rewarded for violating the statutory obligations.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 31 of the Industrial Disputes Act and whether it provides a remedy for an aggrieved employee. The court concludes that Section 31 is only intended to punish the offender and does not provide a remedy for the employee. The court also discusses the issue of whether the Conciliation proceeding is still pending and concludes that it is. The court further discusses whether the notice given to the Planters' Association is sufficient to bind individual employers/estates and concludes that it is. The court ultimately grants relief to the petitioners, stating that the existing service conditions cannot be altered to the disadvantage of the workers without written permission from the authorities before whom the proceeding is pending.

The court order states that existing service conditions cannot be changed to the disadvantage of workers without written permission from the authorities. Employers have the right to request a change in service conditions during a dispute, but the authority must consider all materials and circumstances objectively before making a decision. The employer must comply with existing service conditions until permission is granted. The writ petitions are allowed with liberty to the respondents to move the Conciliation Officer for permission before altering service conditions. No costs are awarded.
