The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed two criminal misc. petitions filed by Basant Kumar Jain against the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and Additional Metropolitan Magistrate in Jodhpur. The petitioner had filed applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to produce account books of the complainant-respondent No.2 during the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. However, the trial court rejected the applications, and the revisional court dismissed the revision petitions filed by the petitioner.

The petitioner had argued that the account books were necessary to prove his defense in the case. However, the respondent No.2 had stated that he was ready to face the consequences of non-production of account books. The courts below had not committed any illegality in rejecting the applications filed by the petitioner, as the respondent No.2 had made it clear that he was willing to face the consequences of not producing the account books.

The High Court observed that the petitioner had failed to show any illegality or irregularity in the orders passed by the courts below. The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the trial court rejecting his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. in a revision petition filed before the revisional court. The petitioner had only challenged the order of the revisional court dismissing his revision petition.

The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to challenge the order of the trial court rejecting his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. in a revision petition filed before the revisional court. The petitioner had to challenge the order of the trial court directly in an appeal or revision petition filed before the High Court. Since the petitioner had failed to challenge the order of the trial court directly before the High Court, he could not challenge the same indirectly in a revision petition filed before the revisional court.

The High Court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the account books from the respondent No.2 by other means, such as by issuing a notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act or by filing a civil suit for recovery of the amount due. The petitioner had only relied on his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain the account books.

The court held that the petitioner could not rely solely on his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain the account books. The petitioner had to make other efforts to obtain the account books, such as by issuing a notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act or by filing a civil suit for recovery of the amount due. Since the petitioner had failed to make any other efforts to obtain the account books, he could not rely solely on his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court dismissed the criminal misc. petitions and stay petitions filed by Basant Kumar Jain against the orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and Additional Metropolitan Magistrate in Jodhpur. The court held that the petitioner had failed to show any illegality or irregularity in the orders passed by the courts below. The court also held that the petitioner could not rely solely on his applications under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain the account books and had to make other efforts to obtain the same.
