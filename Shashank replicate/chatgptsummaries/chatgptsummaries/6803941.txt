The Telangana High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Giridhari Explosives Private against the State of Telangana. The petitioner had challenged the rejection of their representation requesting restoration of power supply for limited purposes. The closure order was issued by the 2nd respondent under the Water and Air Pollution Control Acts. 

The court set aside the impugned order and directed the 2nd and 3rd respondents to pass orders on the petitioner's representation for restoration of power supply and removing the seizure effected on their premises within two weeks. This means that the petitioner will be able to resume their operations and use power for limited purposes. 

However, the court also directed the petitioner to submit a comprehensive study report on their process and steps taken for containment of noise and vibration impact. This indicates that the court is concerned about the impact of the petitioner's operations on the environment and wants to ensure that they are taking adequate measures to mitigate any negative effects. 

The 2nd respondent was also directed to constitute a technical committee to examine the report submitted by the petitioner and pass temporary revocation orders if satisfactory. This means that the petitioner's operations will be closely monitored and any violations of environmental regulations will not be tolerated. 

Overall, the court order strikes a balance between the petitioner's need to resume their operations and the need to protect the environment. The court has given the petitioner a chance to demonstrate that they are taking adequate measures to mitigate any negative impact on the environment, while also ensuring that the environment is not harmed in the process. 

It is important to note that this court order is specific to the case of Giridhari Explosives Private and may not necessarily apply to other cases. However, it does set a precedent for how similar cases may be handled in the future. It is also a reminder that businesses must be mindful of their impact on the environment and take adequate measures to mitigate any negative effects.
