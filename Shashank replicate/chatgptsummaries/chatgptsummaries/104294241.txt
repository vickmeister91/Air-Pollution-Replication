The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Ravindranath GE Medical Associates Private Limited against the State of Karnataka and others. The petition challenged a notice of proposed directions under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court directed the third respondent to grant an opportunity of being personally heard to the petitioner and to consider a fresh survey before passing a final order. The court also made it clear that it had made no adjudication on any factual controversy involved in the petition and all issues are kept open to be decided after hearing the petitioner.

The petitioner, Ravindranath GE Medical Associates Private Limited, had filed a writ petition challenging a notice of proposed directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner contended that the notice was issued without any basis and without following the due process of law.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and directed the third respondent, KSPCB, to grant an opportunity of being personally heard to the petitioner. The court also directed the KSPCB to consider a fresh survey before passing a final order. The court made it clear that it had made no adjudication on any factual controversy involved in the petition and all issues are kept open to be decided after hearing the petitioner.

The court's decision to direct the KSPCB to grant an opportunity of being personally heard to the petitioner is significant as it ensures that the petitioner's views are taken into account before any final decision is made. This is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made.

The court's direction to the KSPCB to consider a fresh survey before passing a final order is also significant as it ensures that the decision is based on accurate and up-to-date information. This is important as any decision based on outdated or inaccurate information could have serious consequences for the environment and public health.

The court's decision to keep all issues open to be decided after hearing the petitioner is also significant as it ensures that all relevant issues are taken into account before any final decision is made. This is important as any decision made without considering all relevant issues could be arbitrary and unfair.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development as it ensures that the principles of natural justice are upheld and that any decision made is based on accurate and up-to-date information and takes into account all relevant issues. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a precedent for future cases and help to ensure that the environment and public health are protected.
