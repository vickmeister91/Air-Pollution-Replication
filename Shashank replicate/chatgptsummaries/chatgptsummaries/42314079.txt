In a recent court order, six individuals who were accused of hunting a Barking Deer and possessing its dry meat were granted bail. The applicants had been in judicial custody since September 23, 2016, and the charge sheet had been filed. The court allowed the application and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one solvent surety each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The case involved the hunting of a Barking Deer, which is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were charged with violating various provisions of the Act, including hunting, possession, and transportation of the animal and its meat. The case had been under investigation for some time, and the charge sheet had been filed against the accused.

The court considered the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense before granting bail to the accused. The prosecution argued that the accused had committed a serious offense and that they were likely to abscond if released on bail. The defense, on the other hand, argued that the accused were not flight risks and that they had cooperated with the investigation.

After considering the arguments of both sides, the court granted bail to the accused. The court directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one solvent surety each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The court also imposed certain conditions on the accused, including that they should not leave the country without the permission of the court and that they should cooperate with the investigation.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused has been met with mixed reactions. Some have criticized the decision, arguing that the accused should not be released on bail given the seriousness of the offense. Others have welcomed the decision, arguing that the accused have a right to bail and that they should not be kept in custody indefinitely.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the accused is a significant development in the case. It remains to be seen how the case will proceed from here, but the decision to grant bail will undoubtedly have an impact on the outcome of the case.
