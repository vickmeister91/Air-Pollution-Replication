The Commissioner of Central Excise had filed an appeal against an order passed by the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, Principal Bench, New Delhi, which had dismissed the appeal. The committee of Chief Commissioners had issued an order under Section 35(E)(i) & (ii) of the Central Excise Act, 1944, directing the Commissioner to file an application before the Tribunal under Section 35(E)(4) of the Act. However, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal by holding that the order passed by the Committee of Chief Commissioner's is barred by limitation and it has no jurisdiction to condone this delay, and therefore, the appeal is not maintainable. The Tribunal has placed reliance upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CCE v. M.M.Rubber Co., 1991(55) ELT 289(SC).

The issue at hand is whether the Tribunal has the power to condone delay in an order passed by the Committee of Chief Commissioner's, asking the Commissioner to file an appeal. The Tribunal has held that the power to condone delay relates to filing the application and not to the order passed by the Committee of Chief Commissioner's. Therefore, the appeal has been dismissed.
