The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has filed a writ petition seeking permission to construct a major bridge across Thane Creek. The petitioner has obtained all necessary permissions and clearances from the relevant authorities. However, the Amicus Curiae appointed by the court has highlighted previous court orders for the preservation of mangroves. The court will now consider the petitioner's application for interim relief.

In response to the concerns raised by the Amicus Curiae, the court has issued an order requiring the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre to carry out a detailed mapping of mangroves in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai using high-resolution satellite data. The identified government-owned mangrove areas will be declared and notified as "protected forests" while privately owned areas will be declared and notified as "forests". The Forest Department and other authorities are directed to take necessary steps for the protection, conservation, and regeneration of the identified areas. The officer designated in the order is required to submit a report on the action plan every three months. The order also allows for permission to be granted for projects that may affect mangrove areas, subject to approval by the court.

The court order emphasizes the importance of sustainable development for the preservation and protection of the ecologically fragile mangrove area. Any permission granted for projects in mangrove areas must be subject to the approval of the court, and parties must obtain leave from the court before implementing the project. The state has a duty to protect and preserve mangroves, and they cannot be destroyed for private or commercial use unless it is necessary for the public good or interest.

The present project for a major bridge across Thane Creek is deemed to be for the public good and in public interest, and the petitioner is permitted to execute the project subject to complying with conditions imposed by the authorities. The petitioner has assured compliance with all relevant regulations, and the court will consider their application for interim relief.

The court's order is a significant step towards the protection and conservation of mangroves in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The detailed mapping of mangroves using high-resolution satellite data will provide a comprehensive understanding of the extent and distribution of mangroves in the area. The identification of government-owned and privately owned mangrove areas will enable the Forest Department and other authorities to take necessary steps for their protection, conservation, and regeneration.

The order's requirement for the officer designated in the order to submit a report on the action plan every three months will ensure that the protection and conservation efforts are ongoing and effective. The order's allowance for permission to be granted for projects that may affect mangrove areas, subject to approval by the court, strikes a balance between development and conservation.

The court's emphasis on sustainable development is crucial for the preservation and protection of the ecologically fragile mangrove area. The state's duty to protect and preserve mangroves is essential, and they cannot be destroyed for private or commercial use unless it is necessary for the public good or interest. The court's recognition of the present project for a major bridge across Thane Creek as being for the public good and in public interest is a positive step towards balancing development and conservation.

In conclusion, the court's order is a significant step towards the protection and conservation of mangroves in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The detailed mapping of mangroves using high-resolution satellite data, the identification of government-owned and privately owned mangrove areas, and the requirement for the officer designated in the order to submit a report on the action plan every three months will enable the Forest Department and other authorities to take necessary steps for their protection, conservation, and regeneration. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the state's duty to protect and preserve mangroves is crucial for the preservation and protection of the ecologically fragile mangrove area. The court's recognition of the present project for a major bridge across Thane Creek as being for the public good and in public interest is a positive step towards balancing development and conservation.
