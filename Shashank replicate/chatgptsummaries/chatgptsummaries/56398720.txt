The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Preeti against an order passed by the Ld. Trial Court in Criminal Complaint No. 198/1/12. Preeti's grievance was that the Ld. Trial Court had dismissed her application under Section 156 (3) Cr.PC and had directed her to lead evidence which was beyond her control. 

The case at hand involves a criminal complaint filed by Preeti against an individual, and Preeti had filed an application under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC) seeking an investigation into the matter. However, the Ld. Trial Court had dismissed her application and directed her to lead evidence which was beyond her control. Preeti had then filed a revision petition against this order.

The court, after hearing both parties, found no illegality or irregularity in the impugned order and disposed of the revision petition. However, the court did grant Preeti the liberty to move an appropriate application under Section 91 Cr.PC before the Ld. MM for production of deeds.

Section 156 (3) of the Cr.PC allows a Magistrate to order an investigation into a cognizable offence upon receiving a complaint. In this case, Preeti had filed a complaint against an individual and had sought an investigation into the matter. However, the Ld. Trial Court had dismissed her application under this section and had directed her to lead evidence which was beyond her control.

Preeti had then filed a revision petition against this order, seeking relief from the higher court. However, the court found no illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the Ld. Trial Court and disposed of the revision petition.

The court's decision to dispose of the revision petition means that Preeti's appeal against the Ld. Trial Court's order has been rejected. However, the court did grant Preeti the liberty to move an appropriate application under Section 91 Cr.PC before the Ld. MM for production of deeds.

Section 91 of the Cr.PC allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, Preeti may move an application under this section before the Ld. MM for the production of deeds that may be relevant to the case.

Overall, the court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Preeti against an order passed by the Ld. Trial Court in Criminal Complaint No. 198/1/12. While the court found no illegality or irregularity in the impugned order, it did grant Preeti the liberty to move an appropriate application under Section 91 Cr.PC before the Ld. MM for production of deeds.
