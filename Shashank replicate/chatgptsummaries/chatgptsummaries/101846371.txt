The State of Rajasthan filed a series of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and another party regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The State argued that the issue was covered by a previous judgment and should be decided accordingly, while the respondents argued that the Collector did have the power to alter the boundaries.

After considering the arguments of both parties, the court found that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Act. As a result, the impugned orders were set aside and the matter was remanded to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents in accordance with the Act.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and the previous judgment cited by the State. The court noted that Section 24(2)(a) of the Act only allowed for the alteration of the boundaries of a sanctuary if it was deemed necessary for the management of the sanctuary or for the welfare of the animals. The court found that the Collector had not provided any justification for the alteration of the boundaries in this case, and therefore had exceeded his authority under the Act.

The court also rejected the State's argument that the issue was covered by a previous judgment. The court noted that the previous judgment had only dealt with the power of the State government to declare an area as a sanctuary, and had not addressed the issue of altering the boundaries of an existing sanctuary. Therefore, the court found that the previous judgment was not applicable to the present case.

In setting aside the impugned orders, the court emphasized the importance of following the procedures laid down in the Act for altering the boundaries of a sanctuary. The court noted that the Act provided for a process of consultation with local communities and other stakeholders before any such alteration could be made. The court found that the Collector had not followed this process in the present case, and therefore the impugned orders were invalid.

Overall, the court's decision in this case reaffirmed the importance of following the procedures laid down in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for the management of wildlife sanctuaries. The court's decision also clarified the scope of the Collector's authority under Section 24(2)(a) of the Act, and emphasized the need for proper justification and consultation before any alteration of sanctuary boundaries can be made.
