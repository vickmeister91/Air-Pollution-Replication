The court order pertains to a dispute over the grant of a Prospecting Licence (PL) for a mining area in India. The case involves two appeals filed by Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd. against the rejection of their application for a Prospecting Licence (PL) for exploring iron ore deposits in Boria Tibbu area of Rajnandgaon District. The matter involves the grant of PL under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The State of Madhya Pradesh rejected Jayaswal Neco's application and granted the PL to Sarda Energy and Minerals Ltd. The State of Chhattisgarh, formed in 2000, took up the issue of grant of PL afresh and rejected Sarda Energy's application, granting the PL to Jayaswal Neco. The appeals were filed against the orders of the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) Nos. 2757 of 2008 and 1038 of 2011 respectively.

The State of Chhattisgarh granted a prospecting license (PL) to Jayaswal Neco Ltd. over an area of 86.380 hectares in Rajnandgaon District, despite the fact that the State of Madhya Pradesh had already rejected Jayaswal Neco Ltd.'s application for the same area. Sarda Minerals Ltd. had already been granted PL in the same area by the State of Madhya Pradesh, but the State of Chhattisgarh did not take note of this fact. Sarda Minerals Ltd. filed a revision petition before the Mines Tribunal, which was dismissed. However, the learned Single Judge allowed Sarda Minerals Ltd.'s writ petition and set aside the order of the Mines Tribunal. The appellant contends that the order recommending grant of PL to Sarda Minerals Ltd. by the State of MP was void and that Sarda Minerals Ltd. participated in the proceedings for consideration of the applications for grant of PL by the State of Chhattisgarh without raising any objection.

The court found that the order granting the PL was quasi-judicial and could not be reviewed by the State of Chhattisgarh. The court also rejected the appellant's argument that the other company was estopped from challenging the decision. The court upheld the decision of the learned Single Judge that the State of Chhattisgarh had acted without authority of law in reconsidering the PL applications and declared that the original order granting the PL stood revived.

The court order discusses the legality of a mining lease granted to M/s Jayaswal Neco Ltd. in Chhattisgarh. The court found that the grant of a prospecting license to the company was illegal and that the mining lease granted on the basis of that license was therefore void. The court rejected the company's claim of a preferential right to the lease and upheld the decision of the Mines Tribunal. The court also dismissed a writ petition challenging the Mines Tribunal's order on the grounds of latches. Both appeals were dismissed.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute over the grant of a Prospecting Licence (PL) for a mining area in India. The State of Madhya Pradesh rejected Jayaswal Neco's application and granted the PL to Sarda Energy and Minerals Ltd. The State of Chhattisgarh granted the PL to Jayaswal Neco, despite the fact that Sarda Minerals Ltd. had already been granted PL in the same area by the State of Madhya Pradesh. The court found that the order granting the PL was quasi-judicial and could not be reviewed by the State of Chhattisgarh. The court also declared that the original order granting the PL stood revived. The court found that the grant of a prospecting license to Jayaswal Neco was illegal and that the mining lease granted on the basis of that license was therefore void. The court upheld the decision of the Mines Tribunal and dismissed a writ petition challenging the Mines Tribunal's order on the grounds of latches. Both appeals were dismissed.
