In December 2013, the National Green Tribunal in Chennai heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appeals were filed in response to orders issued on July 29, 2013. The companies were represented by several advocates, while the Board was represented by Shri D. Nagaraja. The court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976.

The appellants argued that their units do not cause air or water pollution and have not violated any environmental laws. They also claimed that they were not given an opportunity to be heard before the closure orders were issued. The respondent/Board argued that the closure orders were issued in accordance with the law and that the appellants did not obtain necessary consents to establish or operate their units. The court considered the arguments put forth by both parties before making a decision.

The court order stated that the consent obtained by the appellants for their industries was illegally obtained through misrepresentation of facts. The Government of Karnataka issued a notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities in the said zones. The industries of the appellants were established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank and many of them even without obtaining consent for establishment. The court upheld the directions issued by the respondent/Board for closure of the industries on the ground of violating the provisions of Section 25 of the Water Act. The court also rejected the contentions put forth by the appellants' side in respect of validity of the Notification. The court dismissed all the appeals challenging the orders dated 29.07.2013 passed by the respondent/Board directing the industries of the appellants to close the operations and process forthwith.

The court order discussed the closure of industries under challenge, which were issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The closure was in violation of FEE 215 ENV 2000 and a government order dated 12.01.2004, which were issued to protect the TGR catchment area. The government of Karnataka issued a notification classifying the TGR catchment area into 4 zones, specifying the nature of activities in each zone. The closure directions were issued without providing an opportunity to file objections against the proposed direction. The court rejected the appellants' contentions and upheld the closure of the units. The appellants were directed to remove all machinery and materials within a period of 3 months.

In summary, the court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The court upheld the directions issued by the respondent/Board for closure of the industries on the ground of violating the provisions of Section 25 of the Water Act. The court also rejected the contentions put forth by the appellants' side in respect of validity of the Notification. The court dismissed all the appeals challenging the orders dated 29.07.2013 passed by the respondent/Board directing the industries of the appellants to close the operations and process forthwith. The appellants were directed to remove all machinery and materials within a period of 3 months.
