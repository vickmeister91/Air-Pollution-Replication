The first court order pertains to a case where Sukhmeet Singh Anand is seeking cancellation of non-bailable warrants issued against him in a complaint filed by Samsung Gulf Electronics FZE. The complaint alleges that Anand and others fraudulently misappropriated a total amount of USD 85,99,757 from Samsung by fraudulent means. Anand had left India and obtained an Indian passport from the Embassy of India in Spain, giving a local address. The court rejected Anand's argument that non-bailable warrants could not be issued against him in the absence of notice being served to him at his Spanish address. The court held that Anand, being an Indian citizen with a permanent residential address in India, could not evade the jurisdiction of Indian courts.

The second court order is related to the issuance of non-bailable warrants by the police and the court's power to ensure the accused appears before the court for interrogation. The Allahabad High Court has stated that when an accused is avoiding arrest, the police can ask for non-bailable warrants. If the warrants are not executed, the court can issue process under Section 82/83 of Cr.P.C. to ensure the accused appears before the court for interrogation. The court can also issue non-bailable warrants for the arrest of the accused for serious offenses. The court can issue a warrant for appearance before the court only and not before the police. The court can proceed to issue a proclamation under Section 82 of Cr.P.C. if the accused is avoiding the process of the investigating agency and the court despite opportunities being given to him. The petition has been dismissed.
