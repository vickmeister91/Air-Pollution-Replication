The Kerala High Court received a petition to declare smoking in public places illegal and unconstitutional due to the dangers of passive smoking. The court heard arguments from the petitioners, the Advocate General for the State, and other respondents. The court also presented facts and figures on the dangers of smoking, including the fact that one million Indians die every year from tobacco-related diseases. The court concluded that the dangers of passive smoking are real and parallel those of direct smoke, causing death not only by lung cancer but also by heart attack. The court emphasized the need to eliminate passive smoking as an important strategy to reduce the societal burden of coronary heart disease.

The court order discusses the dangers of passive smoking and the need for public health action to eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The court cannot mandate the legislature to enact a law banning tobacco smoking, but it can grant relief by way of mandamus to enforce existing laws. The order also highlights the failure of the Indian government to take significant follow-up action despite being a signatory to World Health Organization resolutions on tobacco control. The order emphasizes the need for education, legislation, regulation, litigation, and enforcement of existing laws to eliminate exposure to ETS. The hazards of tobacco use and the economic burden it places on families and the government are also discussed.

Overall, the court order declares that public smoking of tobacco in any form is prohibited.
