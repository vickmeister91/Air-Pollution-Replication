The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a case where a tribal belonging to the Pulaya community had filed a writ petition seeking electricity connection under the Rajeev Gandhi Grameen Vydhuti Karan Yojana. The Kerala State Electricity Board had forwarded the application to the Forest Department, but it was returned on the basis of an objection by the Divisional Forest Officer. The officer claimed that permission was needed from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, as the electricity line was for non-forest purposes.

The petitioner argued that several new connections had been given in the area without such permission and that the refusal of electricity connection to him was discriminatory. The court found merit in the petitioner's argument and ordered the respondents to grant electricity connection to the petitioner.

The court observed that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court noted that the electricity line in question was not passing through any forest land and that the Divisional Forest Officer had no jurisdiction to object to the grant of electricity connection. The court also observed that the petitioner belonged to a tribal community and that the denial of electricity connection to him was a violation of his fundamental rights.

The court further noted that the Rajeev Gandhi Grameen Vydhuti Karan Yojana was a scheme aimed at providing electricity connection to rural households and that the denial of electricity connection to the petitioner was against the spirit of the scheme. The court directed the respondents to grant electricity connection to the petitioner within a period of one month.

In another case, the court passed an order directing the respondents to provide electricity connection to the petitioner's house before 15.09.2015. The court observed that a road was admitted mainly to give access to certain properties, including the petitioner's house. Public right had been admitted over the road, which allowed the petitioner or the Kerala State Electricity Board to draw electricity supply lines without impeding traffic.

The court noted that the Kerala State Electricity Board had conceded that no cutting or felling of trees was required for drawing the electricity supply line. The court quashed the order refusing electricity connection to the petitioner's house and directed the respondents to provide electricity connection before 15.09.2015.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of providing electricity connection to rural households and ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach the intended beneficiaries. The court also stressed the need to protect the rights of tribal communities and to ensure that they are not discriminated against. The court's orders in these cases are a step towards achieving these goals.
