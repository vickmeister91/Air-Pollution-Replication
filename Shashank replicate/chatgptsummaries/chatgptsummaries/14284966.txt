In a recent court order, the petition filed by Nilgiri Hotel against the State of Himachal Pradesh and others was dismissed. The court stated that the petitioner's contentions could be addressed through remedies provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The petitioner was allowed to file a review petition or appeal before the Supreme Court of India.

The case involved the construction of a hotel in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The petitioner, Nilgiri Hotel, had filed a petition challenging the order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that had directed the hotel to pay an environmental compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs for violating environmental norms. The petitioner had contended that the NGT had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the order and that the order was arbitrary and illegal.

The court, however, held that the petitioner's contentions could be addressed through remedies provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The Act provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court against the orders of the NGT. The court also observed that the petitioner had not exhausted the remedies available under the Act before approaching the court.

The court further stated that the petitioner could file a review petition or appeal before the Supreme Court of India. The court, however, did not express any opinion on the merits of the case and left it open for the petitioner to pursue the remedies available under the law.

The court's order is significant as it reinforces the importance of following the due process of law and exhausting the remedies available under the law before approaching the court. The court's decision also highlights the role of the NGT in addressing environmental issues and enforcing environmental norms.

The NGT was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, with the objective of providing effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The NGT has the power to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues and has the authority to issue orders and directions for the prevention and control of environmental pollution.

The NGT has been instrumental in addressing environmental issues and enforcing environmental norms. It has passed several landmark orders in cases relating to air pollution, water pollution, and waste management. The NGT has also played a crucial role in protecting forests and other natural resources.

In conclusion, the court's order dismissing the petition filed by Nilgiri Hotel reinforces the importance of following the due process of law and exhausting the remedies available under the law before approaching the court. The order also highlights the role of the NGT in addressing environmental issues and enforcing environmental norms. The NGT has been instrumental in protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. It is important that the NGT continues to function effectively and efficiently to address the environmental challenges facing the country.
