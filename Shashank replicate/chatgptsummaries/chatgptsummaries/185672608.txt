The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to violations of the Aravali notification dated 7.5.1992, which prohibits certain processes and operations, including the construction of any clusters of dwelling units, farmhouses, sheds, community centers, information centers, and any other activity connected with such construction. The first case involves a petition filed under Section 482 for quashing a complaint case against the petitioners for violating the Aravali notification by constructing a farm house in Tehsil Sohna District Gurgaon. The petitioners argue that they were falsely implicated and that the complaint was wrongly drafted. The respondent argues that the petitioners are liable to face trial as they had become owners of the land in dispute. The court refers to a report by a sub-committee that found a large number of farm houses had come up in violation of the Aravali Notification and that the petitioners were guilty of violating it. The court does not quash the summoning order.

In the second case, M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. was issued notices for violating the Aravali notification. The court examined the notification and found that the installation of 82 poles and one M.S. gate with pillars and 4 strands of barbed wire amounted to a violation of the notification. The court dismissed the petition.

The Aravali notification is an important environmental regulation aimed at protecting the Aravali range, which is a critical ecological zone in the National Capital Region. The notification prohibits certain activities in the Aravali range, including mining, quarrying, and construction. The notification was issued in response to concerns about the degradation of the Aravali range due to human activities.

The first case highlights the challenges of enforcing environmental regulations in India. Despite the existence of the Aravali notification, a large number of farm houses have come up in violation of the notification. The court's decision not to quash the summoning order suggests that the petitioners will have to face trial for violating the notification. This decision sends a strong message that environmental regulations must be taken seriously and that violators will be held accountable.

The second case is a clear example of a violation of the Aravali notification. The installation of 82 poles and one M.S. gate with pillars and 4 strands of barbed wire clearly falls under the prohibition on construction of any clusters of dwelling units, farmhouses, sheds, community centers, information centers, and any other activity connected with such construction. The court's decision to dismiss the petition reinforces the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the consequences of violating them.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of environmental regulations in protecting critical ecological zones like the Aravali range. They also demonstrate the challenges of enforcing these regulations and the need for strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. The court's decisions in these cases send a strong message that violators of environmental regulations will be held accountable and that compliance with these regulations is essential for protecting the environment.
