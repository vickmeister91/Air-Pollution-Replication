The Telangana High Court recently heard several cases related to alleged offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to several legal cases before issuing a common order. The order pertained to the quashing of proceedings against Bibhu Prasad Acharya and Adityanath Das in SC.No.92 of 2016 and SC.No.2 of 2018 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The court order discusses multiple petitions seeking to quash proceedings in various criminal cases related to alleged offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The cases involve multiple accused, including government officials and private companies. The order includes details of the allegations against each accused and their statements to the authorities.

The court order pertains to the role of B.P. Acharya, the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of M/s APIIC Limited, in the allotment of land to Aurobindo Group Companies and Hetero Group companies. The order states that Acharya abused his official position and showed undue favors to these companies by violating existing norms, regulations, and procedures. He reduced the land price from Rs. 20.23 lakh per acre to Rs. 7 lakh per acre and allotted 150 acres of land to these companies. He also reduced the transfer price from Rs. 500/sq.mtr to Rs. 150/sq.mtr for the transfer of 30.33 acres of land from Aurobindo Pharma Limited to Trident Life Sciences Limited. The order further states that M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited was not a subsidiary company of M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited at the relevant point of time and that the transfer of land to Trident Life Sciences Limited was ex-facie illegal.

The court order states that Shri B.P Acharya is guilty of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 for assisting companies in creating proceeds of crime worth Rs. 21.50 Crore and causing loss to APIIC Limited. The court also mentions that there is no sanction obtained from the government to prosecute him and that the protection U/Sec. 197 Cr.P.C is applicable as he is a public servant. However, the counter filed by the investigating officer argues that all provisions of Cr.P.C. are not applicable to the proceedings initiated by Enforcement Directorate under PML Act and that there are no grounds to quash the proceedings on the alleged ground of want of sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C.

The court order states that the prosecution under the PML Act is independent and does not require sanction to prosecute. The case in question involves a private complaint against 17 accused individuals and companies for alleged offenses under the PML Act. The role of BP Acharya, the former Vice Chairman and Managing Director of APIIC, is mentioned in the complaint as having shown undue favors to Indu Group companies in the allotment of land for an SEZ project, causing wrongful loss to APIIC and the government. The court dismisses the quash petition and vacates the interim stay of the Sessions Case proceedings.

The court order accuses Shri B.P Acharya of violating norms and facilitating the creation of proceeds of crime by Indu Group of companies. He is charged with the offense of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002. The order also states that there is no need for a sanction order to prosecute the petitioner under PML Act, and Section 197 Cr.P.C. has no application. The court rejects the petitioner's arguments and cites previous judgments to support its decision.

The court order discusses the refusal of the state to process sanctions under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which conflicts with Section 48 of the 1974 Act. The writ petitioner, Adityanath Das, seeks to quash proceedings against him as one of the accused in SC No. 2 of 2017 under the PML Act. The court refers to his statement regarding the allocation of water from Krishna and Kagna rivers to M/s. India Cements during his tenure as Secretary I & CAD.

The court order states that Adityanath Das, the former Secretary of Irrigation and Command Area Development in Andhra Pradesh, abused his official position and showed undue favors to M/s. India Cements by allotting an additional 10 Lakh Litres of water from River Kagna without referring the matter to Interstate Water Resources Authority, violating existing norms and causing wrongful loss to the government. He is guilty of the offense of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 punishable under Section 4 of PMLA, 2002.

The order also mentions the liability of companies and their officers for contraventions of the provisions of the PMLA 2002.

The court order discusses a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, where the accused are alleged to have committed the offense of money laundering. The accused have filed a quash petition challenging the cognizance order, stating that the allegations against them are baseless and untrue.
