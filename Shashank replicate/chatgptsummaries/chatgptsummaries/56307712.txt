In a recent court order, the Wildlife department filed a case against Durga Prasad for allegedly trading in mongoose hair brushes, which is a protected species under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found sufficient evidence to frame charges against the accused and he pleaded guilty. As a result, he was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and TRC in default of payment of fine SI for 15 days.

The court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on the accused is a clear indication of the seriousness of the offense. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect endangered species and their habitats. The act prohibits the hunting, killing, or trading of any protected species, including the mongoose.

The court's decision to cancel the accused's bail bonds and discharge his surety is also significant. It indicates that the court considered the accused to be a flight risk and a potential threat to society. The cancellation of bail bonds means that the accused will remain in custody until he pays the fine or serves his sentence.

The court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on the accused is also a warning to others who may be involved in the illegal trade of protected species. The Wildlife department has been actively cracking down on such activities, and this court order is a clear indication that they will not hesitate to take legal action against those who violate the law.

In conclusion, the court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on Durga Prasad for trading in mongoose hair brushes is a significant step towards protecting endangered species and their habitats. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that must be enforced to ensure the survival of these species. The court's decision to cancel the accused's bail bonds and discharge his surety is also a warning to others who may be involved in similar activities. The Wildlife department must continue to crack down on such activities to ensure the protection of our natural resources.
