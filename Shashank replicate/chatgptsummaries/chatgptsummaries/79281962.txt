The court order pertains to the controversy surrounding the expansion of NH-45A, covering a stretch of 179.555 km. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is accused of ignoring the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study and violating the Indian Roads Congress specifications. The court notes that no EIA study was conducted for the project, which is required by law. The court orders the respondents to comply with the law and consider alternative routes suggested by the petitioners. The court also notes that the NHAI has complied with EIA requirements for other projects, indicating selective compliance. The NHAI argues that the project was segmented to expedite completion within a 30-month timeframe. The court discusses the importance of the environment and the need for an EIA study. The issue of locus standi and the legality of land acquisition are also addressed.

The court order directs the respondents to consider a complaint and stop land acquisition for a highway project in Villupuram-Nagapattinam corridor. The petitioners are requesting a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the notification and prevent the formation of a four-lane road through their lands. The court notes that no Environmental Impact Assessment study was conducted for the project, which is required by law. The court orders the respondents to comply with the law and consider alternative routes suggested by the petitioners.

The court order discusses the completion of a highway project, which may take more than 6 years to finish. The project was divided into four parts to avoid the need for an environmental clearance, but the petitioner argues that this is a violation of regulations. The petitioner also argues that the Ministry of Environment and Forests' EIA Guidance Manual should be followed, which requires analyzing alternatives and noting the length and width of the new alignment of the road proposed to be formed in the agricultural lands and forest area. The court also addresses the legality of land acquisition and the petitioner's lack of locus standi.

The court order discusses the importance of environmental governance within a rule of law paradigm, which promotes environmental sustainability and addresses the implementation gap between environmental laws and their enforcement. The environmental rule of law is essential for sustainable development and has benefits beyond the environmental sector, including strengthening the rule of law, supporting economic and social development, protecting public health, contributing to peace and security, and protecting human and constitutional rights. The court also addresses arguments related to the proposed expansion of a road and the legality of acquisition.

The court order discusses the importance of conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study before implementing a developmental project. The court states that the need for an EIA study is statutory and cannot be ignored, even if land acquisition proceedings have already taken place. The court also explains the concept of segmentation, which is dividing a major federal action into smaller components to avoid compliance with environmental regulations. The court notes that segmentation may be proper or improper, and improper segmentation is done with the purpose of avoiding compliance with environmental regulations.

The court order discusses the issue of segmentation-strategy, where planners attempt to circumvent environmental preservation directives by breaking up long-distance projects into shorter sections. The court cites examples from Europe and India where planners have ignored the need for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and were reminded by the court to follow it. The court emphasizes the importance of EIA as a valuable decision-making tool for ensuring environmental compatibility in socio-economic development and upholding the principles of sustainable development and precautionary principle.

The court order discusses the requirement for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for a highway project and the importance of exploring alternatives and obtaining necessary clearances. The court rejects the argument for segmentation of the project to avoid EIA requirements and emphasizes the need for compliance with statutory imperatives on environmental clearance. The court also highlights the significance of CRZ clearance and the consequences of failing to obtain it.

The court order criticizes the High Court for neglecting important questions related to the development and management of the Lakshadweep Islands in a case involving the violation of environmental regulations for a resort. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental concerns and the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study before commencing construction. The court orders the expansion of NH-45A to be put on hold until an EIA study and environmental clearance are obtained, and emphasizes the need for environmental restoration. The court also highlights the disappointing state of affairs in environmental protection and urges planners to approach EIA as an opportunity for environmentally viable developmental projects.

The court order states that 179.555 km of the NH-45A project will be put on hold until the project proponent (NHAI) undertakes an EIA study and obtains environmental clearance. The NHAI is also directed to obtain approval from CRZMA for CRZ clearance for
