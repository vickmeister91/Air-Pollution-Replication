The court order pertains to a dispute between M/S. Ramgad Minerals and Mining and M/S. Muneer Enterprises over the renewal of a mining lease without obtaining prior permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act. The court found that the renewal was illegal and void, and that there was no existing lease held by M/S. Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Limited in the area. The court also noted that the Director of Mines and Geology is duty-bound to conduct surveys to settle disputes between adjacent lease holders. The writ petition challenging the transfer of the lease and the direction for renewal was dismissed.

In another court order, the Director of Mines and Geology is responsible for conducting surveys to settle disputes between adjacent lease holders. The court denied a request to quash an endorsement and allowed the writ petition to proceed. The court also ruled that the petitioner had the right to file the writ petition and that the renewal of the mining lease in favor of M/s. Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Limited was illegal without prior permission under Section 2 of the FC Act. The court also considered arguments regarding the transfer of the lease and the petitioner's locus standi. The court allowed the appeal to proceed but noted that some arguments were not raised before the learned Single Judge.

The court order discusses various arguments presented by the appellant and the writ petitioner regarding the transfer of a mining lease in a forest area. The court concludes that the renewal of the lease without obtaining prior permission under Section 2 of the FC Act is illegal, void ab-initio, and non-est. The court also orders the Central Government to pass orders on the application of the appellant for granting permission under Section 2 of the FC Act. The court further directs the State Government to ensure the cessation of mining activities in forest areas without prior approval of the Central Government. The court cites the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Godavarman's case and prohibits mining activity in areas notified as Sanctuary or National Park.

In the final court order, mining activities in areas designated as sanctuaries, national parks, or game reserves are prohibited, even if prior approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also discusses the legality of lease renewals and terminations, ultimately determining that M/s.Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Limited had not surrendered any portion of the leased area and therefore the area is not available for notification or consideration of lease applications. The court allows the writ appeal and sets aside the order passed in the writ petition.

Overall, these court orders deal with disputes over mining leases in forest areas and the legality of lease renewals and terminations. The courts have consistently ruled that renewals without prior permission under Section 2 of the FC Act are illegal and void. The Director of Mines and Geology has been tasked with settling disputes between adjacent lease holders through surveys. The courts have also prohibited mining activities in areas designated as sanctuaries, national parks, or game reserves, even if prior approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The State Government has been directed to ensure the cessation of mining activities in forest areas without prior approval of the Central Government. These court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of following environmental laws and regulations in mining activities.
