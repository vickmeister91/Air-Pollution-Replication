The court order in question pertains to a criminal case against the petitioner, Anup Kumar, in connection with Forest Case No. 256 of 2006. Kumar had requested the quashing of the criminal proceedings against him, arguing that the area in question had been declared a protected forest in 1954, but had ceased to be so after 30 years. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the notification declaring the area a protected forest remained in operation until denotified by the state government.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which provides for the protection of forests and regulates diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act defines a "forest" as any area that is notified by the state government as a forest, and includes any land that is recorded as forest in government records. The Act also provides for the denotification of forest land by the state government, subject to certain conditions.

In this case, the court found that the area in question had been notified as a protected forest in 1954, and that the notification had not been denotified by the state government. Therefore, the court held that the area continued to be a protected forest, and that any activity in the area that was not permitted under the Forest (Conservation) Act would be illegal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the notification declaring the area a protected forest, and had not obtained any permission from the competent authority for any activity in the area. Therefore, the court found no illegality in the order taking cognizance of the case against the petitioner, and dismissed his application for quashing the criminal proceedings.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, and obtaining the necessary permissions from the competent authority before undertaking any activity in forest areas. It also underscores the need for careful interpretation of the legal provisions governing forest conservation, and the importance of adhering to the procedures laid down in the law.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the critical role that forests play in our ecosystem, and the need to protect them for the benefit of present and future generations. It also emphasizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that all individuals and entities are held accountable for their actions, particularly when it comes to the protection of our natural resources.
