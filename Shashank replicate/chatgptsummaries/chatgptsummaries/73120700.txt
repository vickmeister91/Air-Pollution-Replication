In the first court order, the petitioner filed a criminal petition seeking the quashing of the entire proceedings in CC No.234/2006 pending on the file of the JMFC Second Court, Karwar. However, the court did not quash the entire proceedings but set aside some irregular procedures followed by the learned Magistrate while dealing with the matter. The court found that the Magistrate did not follow the proper procedure under Sections 244 and 245 of Cr.PC. The court ordered the Magistrate to call upon the complainant to lead evidence on his side, examine the complainant and other witnesses, and produce documents before the court to enable the accused person an opportunity to go through the materials on record.
