The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the illegal acquisition and transfer of public land in the state of Punjab, India. In the first case, a retired Deputy Ranger named Subhash Chander filed a public interest litigation against the Revenue Department of the State Government in Kapurthala, alleging that the department had illegally transferred public land to private individuals through bogus allotments. The court found that the land in question had been acquired by the Department of Irrigation in 1952 for the construction of an irrigation canal, but the project was abandoned. The court also found that the land had been utilized for the construction of a drainage system in 1962-63. The court ordered the quashing of the letter dated 30.5.1991, which was used to achieve the illegal allotments, and directed the State Government to remove encroachments on the public land.

In the second case, the court discussed a fraudulent acquisition of land that was originally owned by the Punjab Government. The land was acquired in 1952 and was later declared a protected forest area in 1958. Despite this, the land was illegally sold to private individuals without the necessary approvals. The court found that the actions of the government officials involved in the sale were unlawful and ordered that the land be returned to the government. The court also criticized the Revenue Department for justifying the illegal actions of its officials and ignoring the findings of the Chief Settlement Commissioner and the Financial Commissioner Revenue.

The third case involved a dispute over ownership of land that had been declared a protected forest area in 1958. The court found that there was no final decision or declaration by the State Government regarding surplus land, and therefore, the ownership of the disputed land could not be protected. The court concluded that fraud was committed in this case, and ordered the restoration of the land to the Irrigation Department to be dealt with in accordance with the law. The court also allowed the State Government to consider taking action against the encroachers and recovering mesne profits from them.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting public land from illegal acquisition and transfer. The courts in these cases have taken a strong stance against government officials who engage in such activities, and have ordered the restoration of the land to its rightful owners. It is important for the government to take steps to prevent such illegal activities in the future and to ensure that public land is used for the benefit of the people.
