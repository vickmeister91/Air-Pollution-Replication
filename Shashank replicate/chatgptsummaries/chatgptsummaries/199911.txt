The Karnataka High Court recently issued several court orders regarding the preservation and development of Cubbon Park, a popular public park in Bangalore. The court orders were issued in response to several writ petitions filed by individuals and a resident's association challenging a notification issued by the Karnataka government under the Karnataka Government Parks (Preservation) Act, 1975. The notification specified the limits of Cubbon Park and excluded certain areas, including Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home. The petitioners sought to quash the notification and preserve the park's limits as specified in an earlier notification.

In the first court order, the court noted that the Act is a short enactment with four sections and directed the respondents to file their objections. The court order discusses a notification issued by the Karnataka government in 1998, which deleted a portion of the Cubbon Park area, including the premises of Raj Bhavan and Legislators' Home, for the purpose of facilitating construction. The court examines whether this notification violates the Karnataka Parks, Play-fields and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985, and other statutory or constitutional provisions. The court ultimately concludes that the exclusion of the area was necessary for construction purposes and did not violate any laws or constitutional provisions. However, the court notes that the government must be mindful of preserving and developing the Cubbon Park area as much as possible.

In the second court order, the court pertains to the completion of construction at Legislators' home and the deletion of about 30 acres from the park limits. The court states that public interest, especially the augmentation of drinking water, must be kept in view. The court also orders that trees be planted to compensate for the loss of trees due to construction and that efforts be made to maintain the park in LRDE campus. The court rejects the contention that the decision to delete the area from the notification is arbitrary and that no part of the area once notified can be deleted. The court dismisses the writ petitions subject to the above direction and orders that no further constructions be made within the limits of the park specified in the 1998 notification without obtaining clearance. The State Government seeks permission to set up two reception counters outside the limits of the park, which the court is yet to decide on.

In the third court order, the court pertains to the need for adequate security measures for the Vidhana Soudha and adjoining buildings, including the High Court. The State Government has been granted permission to construct Reception Counters and gates for the High Court building, but only in accordance with the layout plan approved by the court. The Commissioner of Police has been directed to suggest comprehensive security measures for the buildings after consulting with the Registrar General.

Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of preserving and developing Cubbon Park while also taking into account public interest and security concerns. The court has allowed for some construction and deletion of park area for necessary purposes, but has also ordered compensatory measures such as tree planting and maintenance efforts. The court has also emphasized the need for proper security measures for the Vidhana Soudha and adjoining buildings.
