The National Green Tribunal received multiple applications regarding the proposed widening of sectoral roads involving cutting of trees in front of the National Media Centre in Gurgaon. The applicants argued that cutting the trees would lead to significant air and noise pollution problems due to traffic movement in the area. The respondents included Haryana Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF Ltd. The applicants alleged that the respondents violated numerous environmental obligations in respect of the road widening project. The court ordered the respondents to refrain from cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site in question.

The court order discusses a dispute over the widening of a road in Gurgaon, India, which involves cutting down trees in a green belt area. The National Forest Policy of 1988 requires the maintenance of green belts in urban areas, and the court questions whether the widening of the road is necessary and whether compensatory afforestation is adequate. The court also raises concerns about the types of trees being planted and the need for an environmental clearance for the project. The court orders the State of Haryana to file an affidavit clarifying whether the disputed land is part of forest land and whether the Forest Conservation Act applies.

The court order states that the forest land is not involved in cutting of the green belt and the provisions of the EIA Notification 2006 and EPA, 1986 are not attracted as no EC is required. However, the advocate for the applicant argues that cutting of trees and emissions of toxic gases from the vehicles may have adverse effects on the residents of the area. The court addresses various issues related to the project, including whether the land is forest land, whether required permission for cutting of trees was taken, whether the residents will be affected, whether proper permission from environmental angle was obtained, and whether afforestation work has been proposed/undertaken in lieu of cutting of the trees. The court concludes that permission is required to be taken from the Forest Department for the cutting of trees and afforestation work will be undertaken in lieu of the trees which are required to be removed.

The court order addresses the issue of reduced green cover in Gurgaon due to the cutting of trees by HUDA and other departments. The court calls for environmental issues to be considered at the project planning stage and for afforestation work to be undertaken. The court also emphasizes the need for sustainable development and balancing development with environmental concerns. The court allows the widening of a road project but imposes environmental safeguards, including afforestation work, noise prevention measures, and internalization of environmental issues. The concerned departments are required to submit a compliance report within six months.
