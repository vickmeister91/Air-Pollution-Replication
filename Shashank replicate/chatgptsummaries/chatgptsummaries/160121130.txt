The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sukhan Lal Singhal against the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) challenging the cancellation of his allotment of an industrial plot in Bawana, Delhi. The petitioner had applied for an alternative industrial plot in 1996, deposited Rs. 90,000, and was declared successful in the draw of lots held by DSIIDC in 2000. However, he failed to pay 50% of the revised estimated cost of the plot by 31.03.2001, as directed by the Supreme Court, and his allotment was cancelled in 2008.

The court heard arguments from both parties' counsels and reserved judgment on 20.03.2013, delivering it on 02.07.2013. The court order discusses a dispute between the petitioner and DSIIDC over the cancellation of an industrial plot allotment. The petitioner had made payments beyond the deadline, and DSIIDC had issued a circular excluding such cases from restoration of allotment. However, the court found that DSIIDC had waived its right to cancel the allotment by accepting payments and processing charges after the circular was issued.

The court ordered DSIIDC to restore the allotment and grant possession of the plot to the petitioner. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs. The court case has been resolved, and the parties involved will have to pay their own costs. The court order was issued by Rajiv Shakdher on July 2, 2013.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to deadlines and following due process in matters of allotment of industrial plots. The petitioner had failed to pay the required amount within the stipulated time frame, leading to the cancellation of his allotment. However, the court found that DSIIDC had waived its right to cancel the allotment by accepting payments and processing charges after the circular was issued, indicating a lack of clarity and consistency in the corporation's policies.

The court's decision to order the restoration of the allotment and grant possession of the plot to the petitioner is a significant one, as it upholds the principle of fairness and equity in matters of allotment of industrial plots. The court's ruling also serves as a reminder to corporations and government bodies to ensure that their policies and procedures are clear and consistent, and that they are followed in letter and spirit.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a valuable lesson for all stakeholders involved in the allotment of industrial plots, emphasizing the importance of adhering to deadlines, following due process, and maintaining clarity and consistency in policies and procedures.
