The Gir Wildlife Sanctuary has been the subject of a court order that prohibits the government from granting land development permission in the entire periphery area of 10 kilometers from the sanctuary without the leave of the court. However, representations have been made to the court requesting the lifting of the order as it has halted basic and essential developmental activities in approximately 396 villages situated in the zone. The court has heard advocates from all sides and made suggestions for improving and better implementation of the government policy. The court has also considered the restrictions along the rivers and the suggestion made by the state government.

The court order proposes the declaration of a 1 km eco-sensitive area on both sides of the river in Gir National Park and sanctuary to prevent polluting industries, mining activities, or any hostile land uses. The court suggests modifications to the policy to make it more effective and workable, including a complete ban on any construction within 100 meters from a ravine and 200 meters from the edge of the river on either side. The court permits the government to promulgate its land use policy with the suggested modifications. The order does not comment on the legality of the proposed policy, which is already under challenge in another petition.
