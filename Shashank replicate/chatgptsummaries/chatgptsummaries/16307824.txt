The court order pertains to a revision petition filed under Section 401 Cr.P.C. against an order dated April 22, 2014, which dismissed an application filed by the prosecution under Section 319 Cr.P.C. The application sought to summon Jagdish Kumar and his wife Poonam, respondents No.2 and 3, as additional accused to face trial along with other accused. The court allowed the revision petition for respondent No.2-Jagdish, while it was dismissed for respondent No.3-Poonam. The court also discussed the admissibility of documents and the scope of Section 319 Cr.P.C.

The court order allows the prosecution agency to seek trial for those suspected of committing a crime and permits the state to try all accused against whom sufficient evidence has been gathered during the investigation. Respondent No.2 is permitted to be summoned as an additional accused to face trial, while the petition is dismissed for respondent No.3. The order does not express an opinion on the validity of certain documents. An interim order from January 8, 2015, is vacated. The order was issued on May 10, 2016.

Section 319 Cr.P.C. empowers the court to proceed against any person who has not been named as an accused in the FIR but whose involvement in the crime has come to light during the trial. The provision allows the court to summon such a person as an additional accused to face trial. The court can take this step if it is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence against the person to justify his trial.

In the present case, the prosecution had filed an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. seeking to summon Jagdish Kumar and his wife Poonam as additional accused to face trial along with other accused. The application was dismissed by the trial court, and the prosecution filed a revision petition against the order.

The court, while allowing the revision petition for respondent No.2-Jagdish, observed that there was sufficient evidence against him to justify his trial. The court noted that Jagdish Kumar was the owner of the property in question and had played an active role in the transaction. The court also observed that there was evidence to suggest that Jagdish Kumar had received a substantial amount of money from the other accused in the case.

However, the court dismissed the revision petition for respondent No.3-Poonam. The court observed that there was no evidence to suggest that Poonam had played any role in the transaction. The court noted that Poonam was merely a signatory to the agreement and had not received any money from the other accused.

The court also discussed the admissibility of certain documents in the case. The prosecution had relied on certain documents to establish the involvement of Jagdish Kumar and Poonam in the transaction. The defense had objected to the admissibility of these documents on the ground that they were not properly proved. The court observed that the documents were admissible as secondary evidence under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act. The court noted that the prosecution had established the authenticity of the documents by producing the certificate required under Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act.

The court also discussed the scope of Section 319 Cr.P.C. The court observed that the provision was intended to ensure that all those who were involved in the commission of a crime were brought to justice. The court noted that the provision was not limited to the accused named in the FIR but extended to all those whose involvement in the crime had come to light during the trial.

In conclusion, the court order allows the prosecution agency to seek trial for those suspected of committing a crime and permits the state to try all accused against whom sufficient evidence has been gathered during the investigation. The court has allowed the revision petition for respondent No.2-Jagdish, while it was dismissed for respondent No.3-Poonam. The court has also discussed the admissibility of documents and the scope of Section 319 Cr.P.C. The order was issued on May 10, 2016.
