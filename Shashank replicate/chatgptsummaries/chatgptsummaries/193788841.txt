The court order in question relates to a case between Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. and Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity. The issue at hand is a notice that was issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. However, the respondents' counsel has stated that this notice is going to be withdrawn.

The petitioners in this case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions, with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to conserve India's biodiversity. It provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, as well as the National Biodiversity Authority at the national level. The Act also provides for the regulation of access to biological resources and associated knowledge, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their use.

In this particular case, it appears that the notice issued by the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act has been withdrawn. Section 7 of the Act pertains to the regulation of access to biological resources and associated knowledge. It requires that any person or organization seeking to access biological resources or associated knowledge must first obtain the prior approval of the State Biodiversity Board.

It is not clear from the available information what the nature of the dispute between Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. and the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board was. However, it is possible that it related to the company's use of biological resources or associated knowledge without obtaining the necessary approvals.

The fact that the petitioners have been granted the liberty to take recourse of law afresh if needed suggests that this may not be the end of the matter. It is possible that they may choose to file fresh petitions in the future, depending on how the situation develops.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 in regulating access to India's rich biodiversity. It also underscores the need for companies and organizations to obtain the necessary approvals before using biological resources or associated knowledge. While the specific details of this case are not clear, it is clear that the issue at hand was a serious one, and that the court has taken appropriate action to address it.
