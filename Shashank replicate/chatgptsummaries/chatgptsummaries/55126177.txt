The Delhi High Court issued several judgments in cases involving multiple appellants and respondents. The cases were numbered LPA 542/2015, LPA 575/2015, LPA 579/2015, LPA 581/2015, LPA 592/2015, LPA 593/2015, LPA 594/2015, LPA 595/2015, LPA 622/2015, LPA 624/2015, and LPA 757/2015. The appellants were represented by various advocates, while the respondents were represented by government officials and advocates. The details of the cases and the judgments were not provided in the text.

In one of the court orders, the court condoned the delay of 40 days in filing the appeal. The writ petitions filed by the appellants sought directions to the respondents to place on record the policy prohibiting the sale of coal in Delhi, setting aside of Circular/Policy dated July 06, 2011, setting aside Resolution No.874 dated March 16, 2011 and Resolution No.10 dated May 27, 2011 and setting aside order dated November 16, 2011. The court summarized the averments in the writ petitions filed by the appellants and the counter affidavits by the respondents.

In another court order, the court denied the dissolution of partnership due to lack of knowledge about the property and business history. The appellant's family migrated to India after partition in 1947 and started a coal business on the property in question. Tehbazari rights were granted to the appellant's father and later transferred to the appellant. The counter affidavit denied knowledge of some details but acknowledged others, such as the transfer of property and payment of tehbazari fees. The court also noted family settlements and tehbazari rights granted to other family members.

In yet another court order, the court discussed a case where a woman was dispossessed of a coal depot site and filed a writ petition. The court found that the woman's predecessor was only a licensee and had no right to the land after the coal depot business ended in 1995. The court also reviewed resolutions and policies related to coal depot sites on municipal land. The court ultimately allowed the appeal and set aside the previous order, but noted that it did not affect the woman's rights in other writ petitions challenging the policy.

In another court order, the court addressed a policy on the sites of coal depots on municipal land. The Standing Committee made modifications to the proposal, and the corporation passed a resolution adopting the comprehensive policy. The policy includes guidelines for offering Tehbazari sites to holders or their legal successors, resuming MCD land where coal depots were running, and taking back excess land from those running coal depots. The court also notes that the issue of the validity of the policy has been raised and decides to address it on its merits. The court discusses a previous case involving a coal depot and notes that the emphasis was on ensuring a uniform policy is followed by the MCD.

In another court order, the court states that a uniform policy for tehbazari licenses for coal depots is necessary and the respondent corporation has taken a policy decision to offer sites to tehbazari holders near their existing coal depot sites. The policy was not framed to sustain a statement made before a Division Bench of the court. The petitioners have no right to continue to occupy the said premises as their licenses have expired and they are only permissive users. The court has previously concluded that a licensee acquires no right, title, or interest in the land.

In another court order, the court dismisses the petitioners' claim to occupy the premises based on licenses issued by the MCD, as they have no right, title, or interest in the land. The licensees only occupy the site pursuant to permissive use granted by the grantor, and once the license is revoked, the licensee does not have any right to continue in occupation of the premises and is liable to be evicted. The court also notes that any controversy with regard to the ownership of the land in question between DDA and MCD cannot be used by the petitioners to extend their occupation of the respective sites. The court order also addresses the appellants' claim that the MCD policy is arbitrary, illegal, and liable to be struck down, but finds no reason to strike down the policy. The court order concludes that the MCDs were within their right to revoke the tehbazari rights and repossess the property in question allotted by them.

In another court order, the court states that the MCD has the right to revoke tehbazari licenses and repossess properties that have been allotted to the appellants. The MCD does not need to prove ownership of the properties in question, as they have a better title than the allottee. However, if the property has not been allotted by the MCD, the revocation of the tehbazari license would only prevent the person from continuing with the coal trade, but they cannot be dispossessed from the property. The court upholds the Policy dated July 06, 2011, and dismisses some appeals while allowing others. The parties can take appropriate remedies before the Civil Court to ascertain their rights on the properties in question. Any observation made in the judgment will have no bearing on this.
