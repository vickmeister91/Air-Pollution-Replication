The case at hand involves the petitioner's request to quash two orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge-II, Garhwa in S.T. No. 169 of 2010 and S.T. No. 112 of 2012. The petitioner had filed applications under section 91 of Cr.P.C. and under section 233 (2) of Cr.P.C., claiming that certain documents were required to be brought on record to arrive at a just decision of the case, and summoning some defence witnesses was necessary. However, the learned trial court rejected the applications on the ground that the defence had already filed several documents, which have been marked as exhibit and the fact that the case is running for argument for more than three years.

The petitioner argued that the trial court's rejection of their applications was erroneous and that the court should have allowed the documents to be brought on record and the defence witnesses to be summoned. The petitioner cited judgments passed in the case of Rajendra Prasad Vs. Narcotic Cell and State of Kerala Vs. Babu and others to support their argument.

The court, in its order, discussed the use of previous statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code in a case diary. The court cited previous judgments and stated that the court should not be rigid in not allowing rectification of mistakes or the production of necessary documents. The court also discussed the question of deliberate attempts to delay a trial and stated that the final goal is delivering justice.

The court ultimately quashed and set aside the earlier order and remanded the matter back to the trial court to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law. The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial court had not considered the petitioner's arguments and had not given proper reasons for rejecting their applications. The court emphasized that the trial court should consider all relevant factors and evidence before making a decision and that justice should be the ultimate goal.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of considering all relevant factors and evidence before making a decision in a trial. The court also emphasizes that justice should be the ultimate goal and that deliberate attempts to delay a trial should not be tolerated. The court's decision to quash and set aside the earlier order and remand the matter back to the trial court to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law is a reminder that the law must be followed and justice must be served.
