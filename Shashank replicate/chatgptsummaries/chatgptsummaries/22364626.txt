The Indian Plywood Manufacturing Company had filed a writ petition to quash an order issued by the Forest Department to evict them from land they had been granted by the Bombay Government in 1943. The petitioner argued that they were in possession of the land and had filed for renewal of the lease, which was pending. The Forest Department argued that the lease had expired in 1994 and had not been renewed, and that the occupation of the land was illegal and unauthorized. 

The dispute was brought before the court, which noted that the matter was in the statutory concern and that there was a bar under Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code to approach the Civil Court. The court order states that the court has jurisdiction to try all civil suits except those that are expressly or impliedly barred. The lease granted to the petitioner by the government is not considered a civil matter, and therefore, the civil court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the matter. 

The petitioner's claim that they are in possession of the property is not valid as the forest land belongs to the national property and is the duty of the state government to maintain it. The court rejected the petitioner's application for injunction and dismissed the petitions. The court held that the petitioner's occupation of the land was illegal and unauthorized, and that the Forest Department was within its rights to evict them. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the lease had expired in 1994 and had not been renewed. The petitioner's argument that they had filed for renewal of the lease was not sufficient to establish their right to continue occupying the land. The court held that the Forest Department was entitled to take possession of the land and that the petitioner had no right to interfere with their actions. 

The court's decision was significant as it clarified the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters related to leases granted by the government. The court held that such matters were not civil in nature and therefore fell outside the jurisdiction of the civil court. The court's decision also emphasized the importance of maintaining forest land as national property and the duty of the state government to protect it. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of The Indian Plywood Manufacturing Company clarified the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters related to leases granted by the government. The court held that such matters were not civil in nature and therefore fell outside the jurisdiction of the civil court. The court's decision also emphasized the importance of maintaining forest land as national property and the duty of the state government to protect it. The court's decision was significant as it clarified the legal position of the Forest Department in evicting illegal occupants of forest land.
