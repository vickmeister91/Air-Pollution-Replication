The High Court of Madhya Pradesh issued a judgment and order that restrained the state from acquiring land or constructing canal networks for the Indira Sagar and Omkareshwar projects until the Command Area Development (CAD) plans were scrutinized and clearance was granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. The court also directed the state to provide rehabilitation and resettlement benefits to canal-affected persons/families and the Narmada Control Authority was directed to ensure implementation of the directions. The High Court held that the CAD plans were required to be prepared and submitted to the monitoring authority before the commencement of the canals to ensure environmental safeguards were properly planned and implemented.

The court order discusses various issues related to land acquisition and rehabilitation in the context of a dam and canal project. The court finds that the authority responsible for ensuring environmental safeguards may not be able to reverse the acquisition of land due to water logging and salinity issues. The court also notes that the State Legislature cannot make any law inconsistent with the basic features of the Gram Sabha or Panchayats for land acquisition in scheduled areas. The court further discusses the submission and clearance of CAD Plans and the entitlement of canal-affected persons. The court orders that excavation and construction of canal work and acquisition of land may continue subject to approval of the revised plans by the MoEF. The court also directs the State to consider hardship cases of canal-affected persons and provide them with land in the near vicinity or in the canal command area of the project.

The court order states that the government will take 50% of the compensation amount already received as land value, and the remaining amount will be refunded to the government in 20 interest-free annual installments. If the affected parties do not want land from the land bank, they may receive compensation at the present market value plus 30% solatium. Those not considered hardship cases will receive compensation under the Land Acquisition Act with 30% solatium. Any grievances may be placed before the Grievance Redressal Authority for Narmada Water Basin Project. The court also clarifies that the definition of "oustee" does not include canal-affected persons. The court cannot put canal-affected persons at par with submergence-affected persons. The State suggests that more benefits may be awarded to canal-affected persons.

The State has agreed to provide more benefits to canal-affected persons and has suggested that the date of Section 4 Notification be shifted to the date of the court judgment. The Land Acquisition Collector is directed to reconsider the market value of canal-affected persons as if the notification was issued on the date of the judgment and make supplementary awards accordingly. The concession by the State is in addition to the relief granted by the court in a previous order. The appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dam and canal project in Madhya Pradesh and addresses issues related to land acquisition and rehabilitation. The court directs the state to provide rehabilitation and resettlement benefits to canal-affected persons/families and to submit CAD plans for approval by the Ministry of Environment and Forest before commencing canal construction. The court also clarifies the definition of "oustee" and orders the State to consider hardship cases of canal-affected persons and provide them with land or compensation. The State agrees to provide more benefits to canal-affected persons and suggests shifting the date of Section 4 Notification to the date of the court judgment. The appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.
