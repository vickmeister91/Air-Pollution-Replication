The court order pertains to a criminal petition filed by M. Joseph Jayaram seeking bail in the event of his arrest for offences punishable under Sections 2(11),(14), (16), (20), (35), (36), 9, 31, 39, 49(b), 50, 51, 55 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner is accused No.2 in F.O.C.No.2/2013-14 pending investigation.

The court has accepted the petition and granted bail subject to certain conditions, including executing a bond for Rs.50,000 and appearing before the investigating officer whenever called upon to do so. The petitioner is also prohibited from intimidating or tampering with prosecution witnesses and must seek regular bail from the jurisdictional court within three months.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife. It also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

In this case, M. Joseph Jayaram has been accused of violating several provisions of the Act. The specific sections under which he has been charged deal with offences such as hunting, possession of wildlife products, and tampering with evidence. These are serious offences that carry significant penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

The court has granted bail to the petitioner subject to certain conditions. The most important of these is the requirement to execute a bond for Rs.50,000. This is a financial guarantee that the petitioner will comply with the conditions of bail and will appear before the investigating officer whenever required to do so. Failure to comply with these conditions can result in the forfeiture of the bond and the arrest of the petitioner.

Another important condition of bail is the prohibition on intimidating or tampering with prosecution witnesses. This is a common condition of bail in criminal cases, as it is important to ensure that witnesses are not influenced or threatened in any way. The petitioner must also seek regular bail from the jurisdictional court within three months. This means that he must apply for bail again in the court that has jurisdiction over the case.

The granting of bail in this case is significant, as it allows the petitioner to avoid being held in custody while the investigation is ongoing. However, it is important to note that bail is not a guarantee of freedom. The petitioner must still comply with the conditions of bail and must appear before the investigating officer whenever required to do so. Failure to comply with these conditions can result in the cancellation of bail and the arrest of the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a criminal petition filed by M. Joseph Jayaram seeking bail in the event of his arrest for offences punishable under Sections 2(11),(14), (16), (20), (35), (36), 9, 31, 39, 49(b), 50, 51, 55 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has granted bail subject to certain conditions, including executing a bond for Rs.50,000 and appearing before the investigating officer whenever called upon to do so. The petitioner is also prohibited from intimidating or tampering with prosecution witnesses and must seek regular bail from the jurisdictional court within three months. This case highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats.
