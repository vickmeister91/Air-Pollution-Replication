The Andhra High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by G.J. Multiclave (India) Pvt. Ltd. and Medicare Environmental Management Pvt. Ltd. challenging an order passed by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) on May 28, 2016. The petitioners claimed that the order was arbitrary, illegal, and in violation of principles of natural justice, and sought a direction to permit them to collect, transport, treat, and safely dispose of biomedical waste generated from hospitals in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts.

The court examined the functions of biomedical waste management facilities and the legal framework for regulation of biomedical waste. The TSPCB had issued the order to demarcate the operational areas of each facility in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts, based on the location of health care establishments, to increase the regulatory mechanism and fix responsibility of the common biomedical waste treatment facilities for proper handling of biomedical waste. The court examined the representations made by the petitioners and other facilities and upheld the TSPCB's order.

The court order directs the TSPCB to demarcate and allocate areas among four facilities that have obtained consent for operation based on proximity and bed strength of up to 10,000, as per the Central Pollution Control Board guidelines. The order aims to prevent unhealthy competition among the facilities and ensure equal rates across the state. The TSPCB is also directed to monitor the services provided by the facilities and fix responsibility on each facility to prevent dumping of bio-medical waste in municipal dump areas or open areas. The order also requires the facilities to conduct training classes for handling bio-medical waste and submit compliance status within 15 days. The court rejected the argument that the TSPCB does not have the power to demarcate areas of operation among the facilities under the 2016 Rules.

The court order discusses the rules and regulations related to the management and disposal of bio-medical waste. It highlights the duties and responsibilities of various authorities, including the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Central Pollution Control Board, State Government, and State Pollution Control Boards. The court also notes that the State Pollution Control Boards do not have the power to demarcate areas for the operation of bio-medical waste treatment facilities, as this power is conferred only on the Central Pollution Control Board. The court concludes that the demarcation of areas by the State Pollution Control Board is without jurisdiction.

The court order states that the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) does not have the power to demarcate areas of operation for facilities as it has not been conferred upon them under the 1986 Act or the 2016 Rules. The SPCB can only act within the powers conferred upon them and cannot bring into existence substantive rights, obligations, or disabilities not contemplated by the provisions of the Act itself. The impugned order dated 28.05.2016 is beyond the delegated power conferred on the TSPCB and is without jurisdiction. The power exercised under the impugned order is not for the purposes of issuing directions to any industry or any local or other authority for the violations of the standards and rules relating to bio-medical waste. The court also examines the power of delegation and concludes that the power to regulate the facilities or to prescribe regulatory measures such as demarcation of areas of operations among all the facilities has not been delegated by the Central Government to the State Pollution Control Boards. Therefore, the TSPCB lacks authority to issue any directions for violation of non-existent standards and rules.

The court order discusses a dispute regarding the demarcation of areas for factories by the State Pollution Control Boards. The petitioners argue that the order infringes on their fundamental right to carry on their business, while the state argues that it is within their power to impose reasonable restrictions. The court examines whether the order violates Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and whether it is backed by an express mandate of law. The court also considers whether the order is contrary to the Central Pollution Control Board guidelines and whether the TSPCB has the power to demarcate areas of operation. Ultimately, the court finds that the order is not a law within the meaning of Article 19(6) and is liable to be struck down as ultra-vires Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The court order states that service providers were granted permission to establish units and operate in the same area as the petitioners, with each having their own clients. The TSPCB cannot restrict the services of a facility beyond the CPCB guidelines, and the TSPCB cannot prescribe the area within which each facility should provide their services. The CPCB guidelines prescribe the coverage area of each facility, and each facility is required to cater only up to 10,000 beds at the rate approved by the prescribed authority. The revised draft guidelines for Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facilities may enable the State Pollution Control Board to prescribe the area of operation of a new facility to service additional bed strength in healthcare establishments in the locality without interfering with the services rendered by existing facilities. The court also discusses whether the CPCB guidelines have the force of law and whether the impugned order dated 28.05.2016 was passed in violation of principles of natural justice and Article 14 of the Constitution.
