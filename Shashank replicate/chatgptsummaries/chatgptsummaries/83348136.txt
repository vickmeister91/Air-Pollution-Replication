The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitions involve a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur.

The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease.

The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas.

The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the compensation provisions do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the present status of the diverted cluster shows that many lease holders are not interested in extending the validity period of the diversion. The court found that the mining lease holders refused to segregate cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares.

The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excluded the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases.
