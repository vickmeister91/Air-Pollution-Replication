The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Parvati Murmu and another person under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petition sought to quash an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamshedpur in a forest encroachment case. The court found no convincing grounds to set aside the entire cognizance order except for the fact that there was inconsistency in the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

The court set aside the cognizance of the offence taken erroneously under Sections 27 and 29 of the Indian Forest Act and affirmed the cognizance under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The petition was allowed with this observation.

The case in question pertains to an alleged encroachment of forest land by the petitioners. The Chief Judicial Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence under Sections 27, 29 and 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioners had challenged this order on the grounds that it was erroneous and that there was no evidence to support the charges.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that there was no convincing ground to set aside the entire cognizance order. However, the court did find that there was inconsistency in the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. As a result, the court set aside the cognizance of the offence taken erroneously under Sections 27 and 29 of the Indian Forest Act.

The court, however, affirmed the cognizance under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. This section pertains to the offence of making or causing damage to any forest-produce or removing any forest-produce without lawful authority. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the charges under this section.

The petitioners had argued that there was no evidence to support the charges under any of the sections of the Indian Forest Act. However, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the charges under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act.

The court's decision to set aside the cognizance of the offence taken erroneously under Sections 27 and 29 of the Indian Forest Act is significant. This decision means that the charges under these sections will no longer be pursued against the petitioners. However, the charges under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act will still be pursued.

The court's decision is a reminder of the importance of consistency in judicial orders. Inconsistencies in orders can lead to confusion and can undermine the credibility of the judiciary. The court's decision to set aside the cognizance of the offence taken erroneously under Sections 27 and 29 of the Indian Forest Act is a clear example of the importance of consistency in judicial orders.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Parvati Murmu and another person under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court found no convincing grounds to set aside the entire cognizance order except for the fact that there was inconsistency in the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The court set aside the cognizance of the offence taken erroneously under Sections 27 and 29 of the Indian Forest Act and affirmed the cognizance under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The court's decision is a reminder of the importance of consistency in judicial orders and is a clear example of the same.
