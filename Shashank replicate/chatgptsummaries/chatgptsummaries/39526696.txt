The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the petitioners seeking relief against an order allowing an application to send an agreement to the investigating officer for examination by a Forensic Science Laboratory report. The petitioners argued that Rule 181 of the Rajasthan High Court General Rules (Civil), 1986 prohibits issuing records except on requisition of the Courts or by permission of the High Court. The court noted that the petitioner had filed a suit for specific performance of the agreement and that the learned court below had allowed the application to send the agreement to the investigating officer. 

The court referred to the judgment of Mahant Deepak Swami Vs. Additional District & Sessions Judge, (Fast Track) No.5, Jaipur City, Jaipur reported in 2005(6) RDD 1924 (Raj) (DB) and held that the trial court is competent to get the documents examined by the FSL if the petitioner is able to satisfy it about the necessity of such examination during trial of the civil suit. The court observed that the power to order examination of documents by the FSL is not absolute and must be exercised judiciously. The court further noted that the examination of documents by the FSL should not be ordered if it would cause undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the suit. 

The court also observed that the examination of documents by the FSL is not a matter of right and must be based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court held that the learned court below had considered the facts and circumstances of the case and had allowed the application to send the agreement to the investigating officer for examination by the FSL. The court found no infirmity in the order passed by the learned court below and dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order discusses the power of police officers to issue orders to courts for the production of documents or other things necessary for investigations. The court concludes that police officers do not have the power to issue orders to courts under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The order cites two judgments that establish the procedure for obtaining original documents from civil courts for investigation purposes. 

The court finds that the civil court has the power to provide documents for examination by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) if it is satisfied that doing so will not impede the adjudication of the suit. The court observed that the power to order examination of documents by the FSL is not absolute and must be exercised judiciously. The court further noted that the examination of documents by the FSL should not be ordered if it would cause undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the suit. 

The court held that the learned court below had considered the facts and circumstances of the case and had allowed the application to send the agreement to the investigating officer for examination by the FSL. The court found no infirmity in the order passed by the learned court below and dismissed the writ petition challenging the order passed by the lower court.

In both court orders, the courts have emphasized the need to exercise discretion while ordering examination of documents by the FSL. The courts have also observed that the examination of documents by the FSL should not cause undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the suit. The courts have held that the power to order examination of documents by the FSL is not absolute and must be based on the facts and circumstances of each case. 

The courts have also established that police officers do not have the power to issue orders to courts for the production of documents or other things necessary for investigations. The courts have cited judgments that establish the procedure for obtaining original documents from civil courts for investigation purposes. 

Overall, the court orders provide guidance on the procedure for ordering examination of documents by the FSL and emphasize the need to exercise discretion while doing so. The courts have also clarified the limits of police officers' power to issue orders to courts for the production of documents or other things necessary for investigations.
