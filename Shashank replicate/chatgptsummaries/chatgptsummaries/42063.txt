The court order in question pertains to a case where Bepin Chandra Garai filed a suit for possession of certain plots of land against Matilal Marwari and the Maharaja of Cossimbazar. The petitioner obtained a decree in the trial court in respect of some plots but not against the Chattorajas. Later, Hem Chandra Mukherjee filed a petition under Order 21, Rule 100, Civil P.C., asking to be restored to the possession of the two plots in question on the ground that he had purchased them in a certificate sale.

The court ruled that Rule 102 of Order 21 does not apply to involuntary alienations pendente lite and that the opposite party is entitled to be put into possession of the property under Rule 101 of Order 21. This ruling has significant implications for the legal system in India, particularly with regard to the interpretation of the Civil Procedure Code.

The case began when Bepin Chandra Garai filed a suit for possession of certain plots of land against Matilal Marwari and the Maharaja of Cossimbazar. The petitioner obtained a decree in the trial court in respect of some plots but not against the Chattorajas. Later, Hem Chandra Mukherjee filed a petition under Order 21, Rule 100, Civil P.C., asking to be restored to the possession of the two plots in question on the ground that he had purchased them in a certificate sale.

The court ruled that Rule 102 of Order 21 does not apply to involuntary alienations pendente lite and that the opposite party is entitled to be put into possession of the property under Rule 101 of Order 21. This ruling has significant implications for the legal system in India, particularly with regard to the interpretation of the Civil Procedure Code.

The court's ruling is based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. Rule 102 of Order 21 provides that where a third party claims to be entitled to the property that is the subject of an execution sale, the court may order the sale to be set aside and the property to be restored to the judgment-debtor. However, the court held that this rule does not apply to involuntary alienations pendente lite, which are sales that take place during the pendency of a suit.

The court's reasoning is that the purpose of Rule 102 is to protect the interests of the judgment-debtor, who may be deprived of his property without his knowledge or consent. However, in the case of involuntary alienations pendente lite, the judgment-debtor is already aware of the sale and has had an opportunity to challenge it in court. Therefore, the court held that the opposite party is entitled to be put into possession of the property under Rule 101 of Order 21.

The court's ruling has significant implications for the legal system in India. It clarifies the scope of Rule 102 of Order 21 and provides guidance on how it should be interpreted. It also highlights the importance of protecting the interests of the judgment-debtor in execution proceedings.

Overall, the court's ruling in this case is a significant development in the interpretation of the Civil Procedure Code. It provides clarity on the scope of Rule 102 of Order 21 and emphasizes the importance of protecting the interests of the judgment-debtor in execution proceedings.
