The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which were appealed to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The first case involves an appeal filed by Sh. Ratan Lal Sachdeva against an order passed by the Ld. Addl. Distt. & Sessions Judge cum Presiding Officer, Appellate Tribunal, MCD, Delhi. The appellant's shop was sealed due to misuse, and he filed an interim application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Writ (petition) no. 4677/1985 titled as "M.C. Mehta vs. UOI". The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) submitted a report stating that the building was unauthorizedly built, and the appellant did not obtain any revised building plan per requirement of the Master Plan 2021. The court found that the penalty imposed on the appellant was excessive and illegal.

The second case involves the framing of special area building regulations for special areas, unauthorized regularized colonies, and village abadi. The court order states that owners in these areas must register themselves with local bodies within the next six months. The order also references a previous Supreme Court ruling that no construction can be made in premises under scrutiny of the Monitoring Committee, and no order can be passed to regularize such construction or sanction a change of user. The court order allows the appeal on the basis that the shop owner was penalized for not producing a receipt of G-8 charges in time, even though they had deposited the charges. The penalty of 10 times the conversion charges is deemed illegal and set aside.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of following building regulations and obtaining necessary permits before constructing any building. It also highlights the need for special area building regulations in certain areas and the importance of registering with local bodies. The court order also sets a precedent for penalties imposed on individuals who fail to produce necessary documents in a timely manner. The court's decision to set aside the penalty of 10 times the conversion charges emphasizes the importance of fair and just penalties.
