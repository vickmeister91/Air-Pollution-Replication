The court order pertains to three separate cases, each involving disputes over outstanding liabilities and the responsibilities of purchasers in asset auctions. 

In the first case, M/s Ashajyot Mercantile (P) Ltd. filed two cases against the Union of India and State of Punjab regarding payment of dues of the State in terms of auction conditions. The assets of M/s Punjab Fibres Ltd. were put to auction by IFCI Ltd. in accordance with the SARFAESI Act, and the petitioner was the highest bidder. However, the sale of assets became subject matter of challenge before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Delhi on behalf of the Company. The court dismissed the petitioner's appeal and ordered them to pay outstanding liabilities before issuing the final sale certificates in favor of the auction purchasers. 

The petitioner challenged the communication to deposit Central Excise dues and State Sale Tax dues from the transferee. The court relied on various judgments and held that crown-debt such as Central Excise dues or the State Sale Tax dues are not the first charge on the property, therefore, they cannot be claimed from the transferee. This case highlights the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of an auction before participating, as well as the potential liabilities that may arise from purchasing assets with outstanding debts.

In the second case, a dispute arose over whether a petitioner is liable to pay outstanding liabilities of Central Excise or State Sales Tax in terms of a tender notice. The petitioner argued that they are only liable if the liabilities pertain to the unit and are the first charge on the assets of the company. However, the court found that the petitioner was bound by the consequences of Clause 2.7 of the tender notice, which stipulates that the purchaser is liable to satisfy outstanding liabilities over and above the purchase consideration. The court cited Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act and a Supreme Court case to support its decision. The court dismissed the petitioner's argument and the petitions. 

This case highlights the importance of carefully reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of a tender notice before submitting a bid. It also emphasizes the potential liabilities that may arise from purchasing assets with outstanding debts, even if they are not directly related to the unit being purchased.

In the third case, the court order states that the transferee is not responsible for any penalties incurred by the previous management. However, this argument was not presented in the pleadings, so the court left the question open for the petitioner to dispute the claim with the departmental authorities and potentially approach the court if necessary. 

This case highlights the importance of presenting all relevant arguments and evidence in pleadings to ensure a fair and just outcome. It also emphasizes the potential for disputes to arise even after a sale has been completed, and the importance of addressing these disputes through proper channels.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of auctions and tender notices, as well as the potential liabilities that may arise from purchasing assets with outstanding debts. They also emphasize the importance of presenting all relevant arguments and evidence in pleadings to ensure a fair and just outcome.
