The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint filed by Mrs. Asha Vij against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. The complainant had paid a sum of Rs.77,49,695/- for a residential plot measuring 307.77 Sq. Yards in the project named 'IREO HamLET' in Sector 98, SAS Nagar, Mohali. However, there was no development at the site, and the project lacked basic amenities and facilities. The complainant filed a complaint under Section 17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, claiming a refund of the amount paid along with interest, compensation for mental agony and physical harassment, and cost of litigation. The Opposite Parties denied the allegations and stated that the complainant had defaulted in making timely payments. The Commission heard both parties and examined the evidence before making a decision.

The court order discusses a complaint filed by a plot buyer against the developer for offering possession of the plot without completing the development and basic amenities. The court examines the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement and whether it bars the Consumer Foras from entertaining the complaint. The court cites previous judgments and concludes that the Consumer Foras have the jurisdiction to entertain consumer complaints, even if there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. The objection raised by the developer is rejected.

The court order states that the complaint filed by the consumer is maintainable as the complainant falls within the definition of a consumer, and the objection raised by the opposite party is devoid of merit. The court also rejects the objection raised by the opposite party regarding the jurisdiction of the commission to entertain and decide the complaint. The court further clarifies that the value of the plot plus reliefs claimed does not exceed the pecuniary jurisdiction of the commission.

The court order discusses the determination of pecuniary jurisdiction of the Consumer Foras and whether interest claimed by the complainant should be added to the relief claimed. The court refers to previous judgments and concludes that interest claimed need not be added to determine pecuniary jurisdiction. The court also considers whether the development and basic amenities were complete at the site before offering possession to the complainant and concludes that they were not. The complainant is entitled to a refund of Rs.77,49,695/- along with interest.

The court order pertains to a housing project where the developer offered possession of the property to the complainant before completing the necessary amenities and obtaining approvals from the authorities. The court found that the possession offered was a mere paper possession and the developer was deficient in rendering services and indulged in unfair trade practices. The complainant was entitled to a refund of the amount paid along with interest. The court also considered the complainant's claim for compensation for mental agony and physical harassment but found the amount claimed to be excessive. The court also noted that the complainant had defaulted on various installments.

The court order states that the complainant is not entitled to full compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, and deficiency in service due to delay in remitting installments. The complainant is partly responsible for delay in seeking refund of deposited amount. The court orders Opposite Party No.1 to refund the amount of Rs.77,49,695/- to the complainant, along with interest @12% compounded quarterly, within 45 days. Opposite Party No.1 is also directed to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in service, and unfair trade practices, and Rs.35,000/- as cost of litigation to the complainant within 45 days. The complaint against Opposite Party No.2 is dismissed. The court also mentions that if the complainant has availed loan facility from any financial institution(s), such an institution shall have the first charge on the amount payable.

In summary, the court order pertains to a complaint filed by Mrs. Asha Vij against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. for offering possession of a residential plot without completing the development and basic amenities. The court rejected the developer's objection regarding the jurisdiction of the Consumer Foras to entertain the complaint and determined that the complainant was entitled to a refund of the amount paid along with interest. The court also ordered the developer to pay compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in service, and unfair trade practices, and cost of litigation to the complainant. However, the court found the complainant partly responsible for the delay in seeking a refund and reduced the compensation amount accordingly. The court also dismissed the complaint against Opposite Party No.2 and directed financial institutions to have the first charge on the amount payable if the complainant had availed loan facility from them.
