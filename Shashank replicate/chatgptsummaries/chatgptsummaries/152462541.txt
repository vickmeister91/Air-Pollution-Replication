Two court orders were recently issued in India, both related to criminal cases. The first order pertains to an application filed by accused Ashok Malhotra under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The case involves a conspiracy to use fake documents to allot plots under a resettlement scheme for slum dwellers. The accused allegedly used forged documents to allot plots to fictitious persons and then sold them in the open market. The defense counsel argued that certain statements made by co-accused in a related case were not relied upon by the prosecution and that the accused in that case had admitted to a similar modus operandi. The court disposed of the application and did not find merit in the defense's arguments.

The second court order pertains to an application filed by the accused seeking to summon records of a case investigated by ACB (Delhi) which is pending trial in the Court of Ms. Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal, Special Judge, Delhi. The accused had contended that the record was necessary for the purpose of appreciating the context in which CBI had registered multiple FIR/RC and had thereafter filed multiple charge sheets against the applicant. However, the court dismissed the application, stating that sufficient grounds were not made out for the production of the record at the stage of charge in the present proceedings.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper legal procedures and presenting sufficient evidence to support one's case. In both cases, the accused had sought to use certain documents or statements to support their defense, but the court ultimately did not find merit in their arguments. It is important for all parties involved in a legal case to carefully consider the evidence and arguments presented, and to follow proper legal procedures to ensure a fair and just outcome.
