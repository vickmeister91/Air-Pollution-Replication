The court order in question pertains to an anticipatory bail application filed by Kiran S/O. Vijay Kale in connection with an offence registered against him under sections 379, 353 of IPC and section 3/15 of Environment Protection Act. The applicant had argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and that there was no need for his custodial interrogation. However, the prosecution argued that there was a strong prima facie case against the applicant and that his custodial interrogation was necessary to find out the involvement of the applicant in similar offences.

The court, after hearing both sides, rejected the anticipatory bail application. The court stated that the evidence collected by the prosecution prima facie established the complicity of the applicant in the commission of the offence and that his custodial interrogation was necessary. The court's decision was based on the fact that the prosecution had presented a strong case against the applicant, and that there was a likelihood of him absconding if granted bail.

The court's decision was based on the principle that bail is not a matter of right, but a matter of discretion. The court has to consider various factors before granting bail, such as the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the likelihood of the accused absconding, and the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

In this case, the court found that the evidence collected by the prosecution prima facie established the complicity of the applicant in the commission of the offence. The court also found that there was a likelihood of the applicant absconding if granted bail, and that his custodial interrogation was necessary to find out the involvement of the applicant in similar offences.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of criminal law, which require that the accused be brought to justice and that the interests of society be protected. The court's decision also sends a strong message to those who commit offences that they will not be able to escape the consequences of their actions.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the anticipatory bail application filed by Kiran S/O. Vijay Kale was based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, which prima facie established the complicity of the applicant in the commission of the offence. The court's decision was also based on the principle that bail is not a matter of right, but a matter of discretion, and that various factors have to be considered before granting bail. The court's decision is in line with the principles of criminal law and sends a strong message to those who commit offences that they will not be able to escape the consequences of their actions.
