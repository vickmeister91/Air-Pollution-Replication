The case in question involved a petitioner who sought the quashing of FIR No.71/07 registered against him for the offence of Section 91 (6) of the Land Revenue Act. The petitioner argued that he had a "Patta" issued by the Gram Panchayat in 1997 and that mandatory notice was not given to him before proceeding under Section 91 (6). The Public Prosecutor argued that these arguments were based on facts to be considered in the investigation and that only on strong apparent reasons could the FIR be quashed.

The court, after hearing both sides, dismissed the petition. The court stated that all arguments were based on facts to be examined in the investigation and that a more detailed examination of alleged facts was not desirable in such a petition for invoking provisions of Section 482, Cr.P.C.

The Land Revenue Act is a law that governs the administration of land revenue in India. Section 91 (6) of the Act deals with the power of the revenue officer to enter upon and survey any land for the purpose of making a record of rights. The Act also provides for the issuance of a "Patta" or a land title certificate by the Gram Panchayat, which is a local self-government body in rural areas.

In this case, the petitioner claimed that he had a Patta issued by the Gram Panchayat in 1997 and that he was not given mandatory notice before the revenue officer proceeded under Section 91 (6) of the Act. The petitioner argued that the FIR registered against him was therefore illegal and should be quashed.

The Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, argued that these were facts to be considered in the investigation and that the FIR could not be quashed on the basis of these arguments alone. The court agreed with the Public Prosecutor and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

The court held that the petitioner's arguments were based on facts that needed to be examined in the investigation and that a more detailed examination of alleged facts was not desirable in such a petition for invoking provisions of Section 482, Cr.P.C. The court also noted that the FIR could only be quashed on strong apparent reasons and that such reasons were not present in this case.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition seeking the quashing of FIR No.71/07 registered against the petitioner for the offence of Section 91 (6) of the Land Revenue Act. The court held that the petitioner's arguments were based on facts to be examined in the investigation and that a more detailed examination of alleged facts was not desirable in such a petition for invoking provisions of Section 482, Cr.P.C. The court also noted that the FIR could only be quashed on strong apparent reasons and that such reasons were not present in this case.
