The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/S Sumukha Technologies against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner sought to quash a notice issued by the Vijayanagar police under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. requiring the petitioner to secure the presence of Swetha V.M. for further investigation in Crime No. 211/2013. The petitioner contended that no person by that name had worked in their company and that the notice was impossible to comply with.

The court order quashed the notice, but did not express any opinion on whether the petitioner's establishment was complicit in the commission of the offences recorded in Crime No. 211/2013. The court's decision was based on the fact that the notice was issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which allows for the production of documents or other things that are necessary for the investigation of a case. However, the court found that the notice was not issued for the production of any documents or things, but rather for the production of a person who was not even employed by the petitioner's company.

The court order also noted that the notice did not specify the role of Swetha V.M. in the commission of the offences recorded in Crime No. 211/2013. The court found that the notice was vague and lacked specificity, and therefore could not be enforced. The court also observed that the notice was issued after a considerable delay of almost two years from the date of the registration of the FIR, which further weakened the case of the prosecution.

The court order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of due process and the rule of law. The court's decision to quash the notice was based on the fact that it was issued without proper grounds and lacked specificity. The court's decision also highlights the need for law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigations and gather sufficient evidence before issuing notices or making arrests.

The court order is also significant for the petitioner, M/S Sumukha Technologies, as it clears them of any obligation to comply with the notice issued by the Vijayanagar police. The court's decision to quash the notice means that the petitioner is not required to secure the presence of Swetha V.M. for further investigation in Crime No. 211/2013. This is a significant relief for the petitioner, as compliance with the notice would have been impossible due to the fact that no person by that name had worked in their company.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Karnataka High Court in response to the writ petition filed by M/S Sumukha Technologies against the State of Karnataka is a significant reaffirmation of the importance of due process and the rule of law. The court's decision to quash the notice issued by the Vijayanagar police under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. highlights the need for law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigations and gather sufficient evidence before issuing notices or making arrests. The court's decision also provides significant relief to the petitioner, M/S Sumukha Technologies, as it clears them of any obligation to comply with the notice.
