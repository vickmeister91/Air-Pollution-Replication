The court order pertains to a revision petition filed against a judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Special Environment Court, Faridabad, under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and IPC. The petitioner had been convicted and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000 under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and six months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 under Section 285 IPC.

The petitioner had challenged the conviction and sentence on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. The court, however, found that the evidence on record was sufficient to establish the guilt of the petitioner and dismissed the revision petition.

However, the court did modify the sentence imposed on the petitioner. The court reduced the sentence of imprisonment to three months each for both offenses, and enhanced the fine to Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 10,000, respectively. The petitioner was ordered to surrender before the Special Environment Court, Faridabad, to undergo the remaining sentence of imprisonment and fine.
