The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by a man named Lekhram, who had been in custody since August 1, 2014, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. Lekhram's counsel argued that he was a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that the case was triable by the Court of JMFC. The court, without expressing any view on the merits of the case, granted bail to Lekhram on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act was enacted in 1972 with the objective of ensuring the protection of wild animals and plants and their habitats, and to prevent their extinction. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

Lekhram's case is an example of the application of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act is a strict law that provides for severe penalties for offences related to wildlife. Lekhram's counsel argued that the case was triable by the Court of JMFC, which is a lower court that deals with less serious offences. The court, without expressing any view on the merits of the case, granted bail to Lekhram on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The court's decision to grant bail to Lekhram is significant because it shows that the court is willing to consider the individual circumstances of the accused when deciding whether to grant bail. The court did not express any view on the merits of the case, but instead considered Lekhram's reputation as a citizen with no criminal past. This shows that the court is willing to take into account the individual circumstances of the accused when deciding whether to grant bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Lekhram is also significant because it shows that the court is willing to impose conditions on the accused when granting bail. The court imposed the condition that Lekhram furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This shows that the court is willing to impose conditions on the accused when granting bail in order to ensure that they appear for trial.

The court's decision to make the order effective until the end of the trial, but to make it ineffective in case of bail jump, is also significant. This shows that the court is willing to take into account the risk of the accused not appearing for trial when deciding whether to grant bail. The court's decision to make the order ineffective in case of bail jump is a clear indication that the court takes the risk of the accused not appearing for trial seriously.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Lekhram, who was in custody since August 1, 2014, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court, without expressing any view on the merits of the case, granted bail to Lekhram on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective. This decision is significant because it shows that the court is willing to consider the individual circumstances of the accused when deciding whether to grant bail, and is also willing to impose conditions on the accused when granting bail in order to ensure that they appear for trial.
