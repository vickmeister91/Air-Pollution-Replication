In a recent court order, the plaintiff had purchased a property and the defendant had made certain collections on account of the Rabi of 1919. The plaintiff was entitled to be recouped something by the defendant, and the only difficulty that had arisen in this case was on what basis he was entitled to recover. The court determined that the rights and liabilities between the plaintiff and the defendant should have been determined on the basis of the total Rabi rent and the number of days in the Rabi season.

The defendant was given credit for a proportion of the Rabi rent based on the number of days which fall within the period of his lawful possession, and the plaintiff was credited with a share of the Rabi rent based on the number of days between the date of his purchase and the date on which the Rabi rent fell due. The plaintiff was entitled to have from the defendant a sum of Rs. 143, plus interest from the date of his purchase to the date of realization, from the defendant.

The court order was based on the principle of fair and equitable distribution of the Rabi rent between the plaintiff and the defendant. The court recognized that the plaintiff had a right to recoup a portion of the Rabi rent collected by the defendant, but the difficulty was in determining the basis on which the recoupment should be made.

The court considered the total Rabi rent and the number of days in the Rabi season as the basis for determining the rights and liabilities of the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant was given credit for a proportion of the Rabi rent based on the number of days which fall within the period of his lawful possession, and the plaintiff was credited with a share of the Rabi rent based on the number of days between the date of his purchase and the date on which the Rabi rent fell due.

The court order was a fair and equitable solution to the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff was entitled to recoup a portion of the Rabi rent collected by the defendant, and the defendant was given credit for a proportion of the Rabi rent based on the number of days which fall within the period of his lawful possession.

The court order also recognized the importance of interest in such cases. The plaintiff was entitled to interest from the date of his purchase to the date of realization, which ensured that he was compensated for the delay in receiving the recoupment.

In conclusion, the court order was a fair and equitable solution to the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant. The court recognized the rights and liabilities of both parties and ensured that the recoupment was made on a fair and equitable basis. The order also recognized the importance of interest in such cases and ensured that the plaintiff was compensated for the delay in receiving the recoupment. Overall, the court order was a just and reasonable solution to the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant.
