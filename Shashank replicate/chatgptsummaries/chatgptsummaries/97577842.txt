The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by various companies and individuals against the State of Chhattisgarh and other banks. The petitions seek to quash FIR179/2012 filed by Respondent No.4 against the petitioners and return all the books, documents, and other materials belonging to the petitioners seized by the police. The order lists the names and addresses of all the petitioners and respondents involved in the case.

The FIR relates to a commercial transaction involving the sale of iron ore fines, and the petitioners claim that the FIR is without jurisdiction and an abuse of process. The court heard the petitions together as certain common issues arose. The learned Senior Advocate representing the petitioners argued that the allegations made in the FIR are, at best, of an alleged breach of contract.

The court also discusses a dispute between HSL and CMM over a contract for the sale of iron ore. HSL alleges that CMM provided false quality analysis certificates and committed fraud, leading to financial losses. The police have frozen the bank accounts of CMM and its affiliates, including personal accounts of the petitioner. The petitioner argues that the police action is illegal and there is no direct nexus between the frozen accounts and the alleged crime. The court considers the jurisdictional issues and the credibility of the petitioner's claims. The court also notes that a non-bailable warrant has been issued against one of the petitioners in another case.

The court order pertains to two petitions challenging the freezing of bank accounts by the Raipur Police in connection with an alleged fraud in a commercial transaction between two companies. The petitioners argue that the freezing of their accounts is illegal and without jurisdiction. The court limits its inquiry to certain aspects and cites a Supreme Court ruling that investigation of an offense is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the police department, and the adjudicatory function of the judiciary commences only after the police submit a report to the court. The court will determine whether the freezing of the bank accounts was legal or not.

The court states that the police have the authority to investigate alleged crimes without requiring permission from judicial authorities. The functions of the judiciary and police are complementary, and each should be allowed to exercise its own function. The court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it. The court warns against interfering with police investigations and quashing charge-sheets before cognizance is taken by a criminal court. The court dismisses the petitions and states that it is more appropriate for the petitioners to invoke the jurisdiction of another High Court.
