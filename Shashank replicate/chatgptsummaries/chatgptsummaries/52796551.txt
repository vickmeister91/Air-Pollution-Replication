The Jammu and Kashmir High Court recently issued a court order in a case where the petitioner claimed to be the unit holder of a Bandsaw Machine Mill. The petitioner alleged that despite having a license issued by the Forest Department, the authorities directed him to stop the operation of the unit. The court quashed the communication and gave the authorities the liberty to proceed in the matter in accordance with the law.

The petitioner challenged several other orders passed by the authorities, and the court directed the Forest Department to take a final decision on granting a license to the petitioner without any further delay. The Pollution Control Board will look into compliance with pollution control laws once the license is granted.

The court order directs the Forest Department to grant/renew the Bandsaw Mill Licence of the petitioner and forward the matter to the J&K Pollution Control Board for consent. The establishment and operation of the mill without the consent of the Pollution Control Board is not allowed due to potential air, noise, and water pollution. The Conservator of Forests is directed to make a decision within six weeks, and if the petitioner fulfills the requirements, a license will be issued and referred to the Pollution Control Board for consent. The Pollution Control Board must consider the case within six weeks of the license being issued.
