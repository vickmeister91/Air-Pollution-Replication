The court orders discussed in this summary relate to a case involving the protection of forests and the shooting of a film in the Nilgiri South and North Division in Tamil Nadu. The appellant, Veeru Devgan, had applied for a 'no objection certificate' to shoot a part of the film in the forest and had been granted permission subject to certain conditions. However, the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) cancelled the permission on the grounds that the appellant had violated the conditions and caused damage to the grasslands.

The High Court of Judicature at Madras held that the appellant had not violated the terms and conditions of the permission and had not caused damage to the grassland or adversely affected the environment. However, the court directed the appellant to deposit Rs. fifty lakhs for the protection and improvement of the environment and the forest in and around Udhagamandalam. The court also directed the appellant to deposit an amount of Rs.10,800/- as ground rent for the erection of temporary sets.

The appellant filed an appeal against the directions issued by the High Court, arguing that the cancellation of the permission was illegal and contrary to law. The court found that it was not proved that the appellant had violated the terms and conditions of the licence and that the cancellation of the licence and termination of the agreement was therefore illegal and contrary to law. The court also found that temporary structures, such as a film set, on forest land for a short period of time do not constitute breaking up the forest land.

The court appointed a commissioner to supervise the producer's activities in the forest and directed the producer to deposit Rs. 50 lakhs for environmental protection. However, the counsel argued that the grounds for imposing the deposit were irrelevant and extraneous to the issue at hand. The court ultimately set aside the order of cancellation of the license and termination of the agreement.

In another court order, it was found that the direction issued by the High Court to pay Rs. 50 lakhs was not in accordance with the law or based on the materials before the court. The court also found that the activity undertaken by the appellant did not amount to breaking up the forest land and therefore, the High Court's direction to deposit the amount for environmental protection was not justified.

The court ruled that the High Court was wrong to order the appellant to deposit Rs. 50 lakhs for environmental protection and preservation of forests. The appellant was entitled to a refund of the amount with accrued interest, as well as a refund of Rs. 2 lakhs paid to the State without interest. The appeal was allowed, and there was no order as to costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary relate to a case involving the shooting of a film in a forest in Tamil Nadu and the protection of the environment and forest land. The court found that the cancellation of the permission was illegal and contrary to law and that temporary structures on forest land for a short period of time do not constitute breaking up the forest land. The court also found that the High Court's direction to deposit Rs. 50 lakhs for environmental protection was not justified and ordered a refund of the amount with accrued interest.
