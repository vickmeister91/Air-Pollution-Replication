The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ispat Industries Ltd. against the Union of India, State of Maharashtra, Maharashtra State Mining Corporation Ltd., and M/s. Lloyds Metal and Engineering Ltd. The petitioner sought relief against the order passed by the 1st respondent and requested the 2nd respondent to consider the matter afresh and grant mining lease to the petitioner in accordance with the MMDR act and MCR 1960.

The court examined the case and found that the petitioner had not challenged the letter of intent issued to the fourth respondent, and the order rejecting the petitioner's application for prospecting license had attained finality. The court also noted that the petitioner had filed a revision petition before the Central Government under Section 30 of the MMDR Act read with Rule 54 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, but the fourth respondent was not impleaded as a party to the revision petition, and the letter of intent in their favour was not questioned.

The court ultimately set aside the transfer of the letter of intent in favour of GMML, holding that only mining lease can be transferred under the MC Rules. The court found that the transfer of the letter of intent was illegal and unjust, and that the original letter of intent issued to LMEL should revert to it. The court also found that the intention of the parties was not to novate or cancel the original letter of intent.

The court noted that the impleaded party had obtained clearance under the Forest Conservation Act and made substantial investment for diversion of forest land for non-forest purpose. However, the court found that this did not justify the transfer of the letter of intent to the impleaded party.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ispat Industries Ltd. against the Union of India, State of Maharashtra, Maharashtra State Mining Corporation Ltd., and M/s. Lloyds Metal and Engineering Ltd.
