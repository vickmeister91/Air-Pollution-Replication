The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Kedar against an order passed by the 2nd Additional Principal Judge, Indore, in M.Cr.C. No.777/2015, which awarded interim maintenance to the respondent no.1 and respondents no. 2 to 4. Kedar had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking a direction to the respondents to produce the birth certificates of respondents no. 2 to 4, but the application was still pending. Kedar had claimed that all three respondents were major and not entitled to maintenance, but had not given their date of birth.

The court held that Kedar had not disputed the paternity of respondents no. 2 to 4 and that the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was filed to delay the disposal of the application for grant of interim maintenance. The court also held that Kedar could not take advantage of an ex-parte decree of restitution of conjugal rights unless he proved that the respondent no.1 was not willing to join his company and was residing separately without any sufficient cause. The court affirmed the order of the Trial Court awarding interim maintenance to the respondents.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the awarding of interim maintenance to the respondent no.1 and respondents no. 2 to 4. Kedar, the petitioner, had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking a direction to the respondents to produce the birth certificates of respondents no. 2 to 4, claiming that they were major and not entitled to maintenance. However, the court held that Kedar had not disputed the paternity of respondents no. 2 to 4 and that the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was filed to delay the disposal of the application for grant of interim maintenance.

The court also held that Kedar could not take advantage of an ex-parte decree of restitution of conjugal rights unless he proved that the respondent no.1 was not willing to join his company and was residing separately without any sufficient cause. This means that Kedar could not use the decree to his advantage unless he could prove that the respondent no.1 was at fault for the separation.

The court affirmed the order of the Trial Court awarding interim maintenance to the respondents. This means that the order for interim maintenance stands and Kedar will have to comply with it.

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on the evidence presented in the case. Kedar had not disputed the paternity of respondents no. 2 to 4 and had not provided their date of birth. This means that the court had no reason to doubt their entitlement to maintenance. Additionally, Kedar had filed the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to delay the disposal of the application for grant of interim maintenance, which the court found to be an abuse of process.

Overall, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of presenting evidence and not abusing legal processes. It also highlights the importance of complying with court orders, as Kedar will now have to comply with the order for interim maintenance.
