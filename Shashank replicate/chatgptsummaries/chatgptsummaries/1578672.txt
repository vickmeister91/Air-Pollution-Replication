In two separate court orders, a man accused of possessing tusks of an elephant was found guilty and sentenced to six months of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500. The case pertains to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, which considers elephant tusks as government property. The court rejected the accused's claims of innocence and found the evidence presented by forest officials to be credible. The court also dismissed the accused's claims of prejudice due to the incorrect sections of the offense being cited in the complaint filed against him.

In the first court order, the accused was found guilty of possessing elephant tusks, which are considered government property under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court sentenced him to six months of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500. The accused had claimed innocence, but the court found the evidence presented by forest officials to be credible. The court also dismissed the accused's claims of prejudice due to the incorrect sections of the offense being cited in the complaint filed against him.

In the second court order, a revision petition filed by the accused was dismissed, and the sentence of six months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500 was upheld. The court found no merit in the argument that there was prejudice or failure of justice due to the lack of specific reference to Sections 39 and 49 of the Act in the charge. The sentence was deemed reasonable, and the petitioner was ordered to appear before the magistrate for execution of the sentence.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including elephants, without a license. It also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any animal or its parts, including tusks, without a license.

The court also dismissed the accused's claims of prejudice due to the incorrect sections of the offense being cited in the complaint filed against him.
