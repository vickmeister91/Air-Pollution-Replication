The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Surya Prakash Sharma challenging an order passed by a Special Metropolitan Magistrate and a revisional court. The petitioner had requested the Income Tax Returns of the complainant during cross-examination under Section 91 Cr.P.C. However, the court declined the petitioner's request, stating that extensive cross-examination cannot be permitted, especially when the complainant has already admitted to showing his income as Rs.4 lakh in his Income Tax Returns.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner's request for the Income Tax Returns was not relevant to the case at hand. The court noted that the complainant had already admitted to showing his income as Rs.4 lakh in his Income Tax Returns, and therefore, the petitioner's request for the Income Tax Returns was unnecessary. The court also noted that allowing extensive cross-examination would only serve to delay the proceedings and waste the court's time.

The court further stated that the petitioner may examine an official of the Income Tax Department in defense if required. This means that if the petitioner feels that an official from the Income Tax Department can provide relevant information to the case, they may call upon them to testify in court.

Overall, the court's decision was based on the principle of relevance. The court noted that the petitioner's request for the Income Tax Returns was not relevant to the case at hand, and therefore, it was not necessary to allow extensive cross-examination. The court's decision was also based on the need to ensure that the proceedings are conducted efficiently and without unnecessary delays.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Surya Prakash Sharma challenging an order passed by a Special Metropolitan Magistrate and a revisional court. The court declined the petitioner's request for the Income Tax Returns of the complainant during cross-examination, stating that it was not relevant to the case at hand. The court also noted that allowing extensive cross-examination would only serve to delay the proceedings and waste the court's time. However, the petitioner may examine an official of the Income Tax Department in defense if required.
