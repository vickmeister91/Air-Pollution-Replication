The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over industrial units and their licenses, with concerns raised about pollution and nuisance caused by the units. In the first case, Sukumaran challenged the grant of license and consent to establish and operate an industrial unit manufacturing hollow bricks using cement, citing sound and air pollution. The court heard all the petitions together and disposed of them, stating that the basic facts were not in dispute. In the second case, a petitioner objected to a grant of permission for a hollow brick manufacturing unit, citing pollution concerns. The court rejected the argument that the case should be transferred to the National Green Tribunal, as no substantial question relating to the environment had been raised. The court also examined a contention that the Panchayat did not have the power to grant permission for a motor with a power of more than 5 HP, but found that the Village Panchayat was authorized to issue such a license.

The third case involved a manufacturing unit and its license in a village panchayat. The court examined the powers of the panchayat and the secretary in granting licenses and concluded that the license granted to the manufacturing unit was valid. The court also addressed concerns about the categorization of the industry and the distance it must maintain from residential areas. The petitioner alleged that the unit caused nuisance and hardships to neighboring residents, and the court noted that the unit was directed to take measures to prevent pollution. The petitioner also challenged the renewal of the unit's license, but the court found that the renewal was validly granted.

In the fourth case, the dispute was over the renewal of a license for an industrial unit. The petitioner alleged that the unit was causing pollution and nuisance, while the respondent argued that the allegations were baseless. The Pollution Control Board conducted a trial run and found that the unit was not causing pollution, and granted a consent to operate. The court accepted the assessment made by the Pollution Control Board and found no grounds to interdict the functioning of the unit. The court also noted a discrepancy in the machinery installed and directed the authorities to address the issue.

Finally, in the fifth case, the court accepted the Pollution Control Board's monitoring of a unit and allowed it to take necessary action if pollution was detected. The unit was allowed to function based on the consent to operate and the Panchayat license. The petitioner was accused of abusing the process of the court by filing multiple proceedings. A review petition filed by the 1st respondent was dismissed as infructuous. The court directed the inspection of the unit and periodic monitoring to ensure compliance with pollution control laws. Two petitions were disposed of with the given directions.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of addressing concerns about pollution and nuisance caused by industrial units, while also ensuring that licenses and permissions are granted in accordance with the law. The courts have examined the powers of local authorities and pollution control boards in granting licenses and monitoring units, and have emphasized the need for compliance with pollution control laws. While some petitions have been dismissed, others have been disposed of with directions for periodic monitoring and compliance.
