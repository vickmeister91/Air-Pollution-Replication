Aman Saxena, who had been in custody since January 6, 2016, in connection with a wildlife protection case, was granted bail by the court. The court allowed the bail application and directed Saxena to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC or CJM for his appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial.

The case against Saxena pertains to the alleged violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Saxena was accused of hunting and killing a protected animal, which is a punishable offence under the Act. He was arrested by the forest department officials and had been in custody since then.

Saxena had filed a bail application in the court, which was opposed by the prosecution. The prosecution argued that Saxena was a habitual offender and had a history of wildlife crimes. They also contended that if Saxena was released on bail, he might tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

However, the court found no merit in the prosecution's arguments and granted bail to Saxena. The court directed Saxena to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to Saxena has been welcomed by his family and supporters. They have been campaigning for his release since his arrest and have maintained that he is innocent.

The case against Saxena is still pending in the trial court, and he will have to appear before the court on the dates fixed by the court during the trial. The court has also directed Saxena to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Aman Saxena in connection with a wildlife protection case has been a relief for his family and supporters. The court has directed Saxena to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial. The case against Saxena is still pending in the trial court, and he will have to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.
