The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Rajni Bansal and others against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court order provides a summary of the various orders issued by the NGT.

The court order discusses pollution caused by untreated water in the Ganga Nahar Canal and its distributories. The court directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples and analyze them to determine the standard of water running through the distributories. The state is also directed to come up with a comprehensive short-term and long-term plan to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs the state to enforce this by invoking the polluter pays principle. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the despatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009 to them before the next date of hearing. The court orders the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all the relevant records on the next date of hearing.

The court order directs the State of Rajasthan to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant and remove all encroachments within one month. The order also directs the State to issue show cause notices to those causing pollution and remove existing structures contributing to pollution. The State is also directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The compliance report is to be filed by January 29, 2016, and the State is to issue notices to those contributing to pollution. The order was passed due to the State's lethargic attitude towards implementing the Tribunal's order.

This court order pertains to a PIL filed against the State of Rajasthan for pollution and encroachment on the Indira Gandhi Canal. The court has directed the state government to issue notices to those contributing to the pollution and to remove existing structures causing contamination of canal water. The court has also ordered the state to file a compliance report. The court has expressed dissatisfaction with the state's compliance and has given the state another opportunity to comply with the directions. The court has directed the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court has also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The court has emphasized the importance of protecting fundamental rights and the need to exhaust all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court may still insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy if that is efficacious. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is efficacious and the Tribunal possesses ample power to condone the delay. The writ petition was dismissed with the liberty to the petitioner to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015.

The court has directed the state government to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state has also been directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.
