The Jharkhand High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Tarun Kumar Ghosh and Ranjit Kumar Roy, who were apprehending their arrest in connection with a case registered for the offences punishable under the Environment Protection Act, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that during the period in which it was alleged that the Panem Coal Company had violated the norms of the Central Government and made excess production, the petitioners cannot be held responsible for excess production as it was within the specifications mentioned by the Pollution Control Board in its earlier no objection certificate.

The petitioners had approached the High Court seeking anticipatory bail after the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Godda, had rejected their bail application. The case against the petitioners was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Regional Officer of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, alleging that the Panem Coal Company had violated the norms of the Central Government and made excess production, causing damage to the environment.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, observed that the petitioners were not directly involved in the production of coal and were only employees of the Panem Coal Company. The court further observed that the petitioners had obtained the necessary no objection certificate from the Pollution Control Board before commencing the production of coal and had complied with the specifications mentioned in the certificate.

The court also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had appeared before the investigating officer whenever required. The court, therefore, found that the petitioners were entitled to anticipatory bail and directed them to surrender in the court below within three weeks from the date of the order and would be released on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and complying with the specifications mentioned in the no objection certificate issued by the Pollution Control Board. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for investigating agencies to differentiate between the roles played by different individuals in a company and not hold all employees responsible for the actions of the company.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Tarun Kumar Ghosh and Ranjit Kumar Roy is a welcome move as it upholds the principle of natural justice and ensures that innocent individuals are not harassed by the investigating agencies. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to companies to comply with the norms of the Central Government and obtain necessary permissions before commencing production.
