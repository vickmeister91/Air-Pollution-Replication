In two criminal appeals filed by R. Shivakumar and R. Ramamohan, the court order pertains to their conviction for offences under the Indian Electricity Act and the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The appeals were heard together as they arose from a common judgment. The accused were convicted for giving unauthorized power connection to their zinc wire fencing to protect their sugarcane crop from wild animals, which resulted in the death of a female elephant. However, the court found that the complaint was filed by an incompetent authority and therefore, the proceedings were vitiated. The court also found that the prosecution failed to establish the scene of the offence and that the boundaries of the land mentioned in the spot mahazar differed from the rough sketch. The court held that the accused should be acquitted of the offences alleged against them.

The court order discusses the appeal of the accused who were convicted for the death of an elephant due to electrocution. The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove that the land belonged to the accused and that the boundaries mentioned in the spot mahazar differed from the rough sketch. The prosecution argued that the elephant died due to electrocution in the land of the accused who had fenced their land with zinc wire and had given unauthorized power connection to the said zinc wire fencing from the main KEB service line. The court analyzed the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and found inconsistencies and contradictions. The court also noted that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the land and that the mandatory provision of Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act was not followed in strictosenso. The court set aside the judgment of conviction and ordered the accused to be acquitted for the offenses alleged against them.

In the second court order, the appeal of the accused who were convicted for the death of an elephant due to electrocution was discussed. The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove that the land belonged to the accused and that the boundaries mentioned in the spot mahazar differed from the rough sketch. The prosecution argued that the elephant died due to electrocution in the land of the accused who had fenced their land with zinc wire and had given unauthorized power connection to the said zinc wire fencing from the main KEB service line. The court analyzed the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and found inconsistencies and contradictions. The court also noted that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the land and that the mandatory provision of Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act was not followed in strictosenso. The court set aside the judgment of conviction and ordered the accused to be acquitted for the offenses alleged against them.

In both court orders, the prosecution failed to establish the scene of the offence and the identity of the land. The court found inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence presented by the prosecution witnesses. Additionally, the mandatory provision of Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act was not followed in strictosenso. As a result, the court set aside the judgment of conviction and ordered the accused to be acquitted for the offenses alleged against them.

The court order highlights the importance of following the mandatory provisions of the law and establishing the identity of the land and the scene of the offence. It also emphasizes the need for consistency and accuracy in the evidence presented by the prosecution witnesses. The court's decision to acquit the accused in both cases serves as a reminder that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution and that the accused are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
