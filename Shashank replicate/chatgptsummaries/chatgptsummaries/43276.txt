In a recent court order, a petition filed by Niel Philip Christian was dismissed by the court. Christian was an accused in a complaint filed by the State of Gujarat and had requested that the Investigating Officer recover and collect copies of documents mentioned in Annexure-A before proceeding with the investigation. However, the court found that there was no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law that allowed the accused to insist on receiving such documents before being interrogated or before the Investigating Officer could proceed with the investigation.

The court also found that the reference to Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was wholly misconceived. Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court held that this provision did not apply to the present case as it was the accused who was seeking the production of documents, and not the court.

The court further observed that the accused had not made out any case for the recovery and collection of the documents mentioned in Annexure-A. The court noted that the accused had not even specified the nature of the documents or how they were relevant to the investigation. The court held that the accused could not be allowed to delay the investigation by insisting on the production of documents without any basis.

The court also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, where it was held that the accused had no right to inspect the case diary or any other document before the commencement of the trial. The court held that the same principle applied in the present case, and the accused could not insist on the production of documents before the investigation was completed.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Niel Philip Christian and held that there was no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law that allowed the accused to insist on receiving documents before being interrogated or before the Investigating Officer could proceed with the investigation. The court also held that the accused had not made out any case for the recovery and collection of the documents mentioned in Annexure-A and that the reference to Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was wholly misconceived. The court emphasized that the accused could not be allowed to delay the investigation by insisting on the production of documents without any basis.
