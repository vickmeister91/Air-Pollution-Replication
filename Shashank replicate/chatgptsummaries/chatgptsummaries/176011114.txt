On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in response to multiple writ petitions (CWP Nos.) filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land in Himachal Pradesh. While the details of each case were not provided in the summary, the court noted that the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land. 

The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court noted that some of the encroachers were proprietors of the village, while others were landless and homeless. 

The court order pertained to the issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court refrained from expressing any views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. 

However, the court directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and the authorities were directed to take a holistic view of the matter. 

The court clarified that the decision would be subject to judicial review and that status quo shall be maintained until the policy decision was taken. This order was significant as it addressed the issue of encroachment on government land, which has been a contentious issue in India for many years. 

The court's decision to leave the matter to the policy makers was a wise one, as it recognized that the issue was complex and required a nuanced approach. The court's direction to the state government to take a final decision within three months was also important, as it provided a timeline for action to be taken. 

The court's order also recognized the different categories of people who were encroaching on government land, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. This recognition was important, as it highlighted the fact that there were different reasons why people were encroaching on government land, and that each case needed to be considered on its own merits. 

Overall, the court's order was a positive step towards addressing the issue of encroachment on government land in India. It recognized the complexity of the issue and provided a timeline for action to be taken. It also recognized the different categories of people who were encroaching on government land, which was an important step towards finding a solution that was fair and just for all.
