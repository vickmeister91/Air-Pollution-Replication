The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Gurdev Ice Factory seeking to quash a complaint made by residents of Mohalla Chander Nagar Batala, alleging that ammonia gas was leaking from the factory and was injurious to their health and eatables. The petitioner also sought to quash an order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate (S.D.M.) directing the factory to stop functioning within 7 days and show cause why the order should not be made absolute.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that proceedings under Section 133 Cr. P. C. are summary and intended to enable the Magistrate to summarily deal with cases of urgency or of imminent danger to public interest. The court held that the conditional order of the S.D.M. directing the petitioner to stop the functioning of the factory could not be said to be invalid, and that the petitioner could lead evidence to satisfy the S.D.M. that the leakage of gas had stopped and effective steps had been taken to avoid leakage in the future.

The case revolves around the issue of whether the factory was responsible for the leakage of ammonia gas and whether the gas was injurious to the health of the residents of Mohalla Chander Nagar Batala.

The petitioner, Gurdev Ice Factory, had denied the allegations and had claimed that the factory was not responsible for the leakage of gas. The factory had also claimed that it had taken all necessary steps to prevent the leakage of gas and that the gas was not injurious to the health of the residents.

The court, however, held that the proceedings under Section 133 Cr. P. C. were summary in nature and were intended to enable the Magistrate to summarily deal with cases of urgency or of imminent danger to public interest. The court held that the complaint made by the residents of Mohalla Chander Nagar Batala was a matter of public interest and that the S.D.M. had the power to pass a conditional order directing the factory to stop functioning within 7 days.

The court also held that the petitioner could lead evidence to satisfy the S.D.M. that the leakage of gas had stopped and effective steps had been taken to avoid leakage in the future. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by Gurdev Ice Factory seeking to quash the complaint made by the residents of Mohalla Chander Nagar Batala and the order passed by the S.D.M. directing the factory to stop functioning within 7 days.
