The court order pertains to a case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against three accused persons for committing the offence of money-laundering under the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act. The accused were allegedly involved in the illegal trade of uncured trophies of tiger parts and had invested a huge amount in the business. The ED had provisionally attached the car and cash recovered from the accused, and the Adjudicating Authority had confirmed the attachment. The court took cognizance of the complaint and framed charges against the accused, who pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The ED examined six witnesses to prove its case. One of the accused had died during the trial, and proceedings against him had abated. The court announced its judgment on 9 September 2019.

The court order describes the investigation and seizure of tiger parts and cash from the accused Surajpal @ Chacha (A-1), who had given money to accused Surajbhan @ Sarju (A-2) to procure tiger parts. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) were involved in the investigation, and provisional attachment orders were passed for the seized properties. Statements were recorded from all three accused persons, and the provisional attachment orders were confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority. The court also referred to the FIR, seizure memos, and disclosure statements recorded during the investigation.

The court order discusses the testimony and evidence presented in a case involving the illegal wildlife trade. The Enforcement Directorate has seized money and wildlife contraband from the accused, and the court has convicted some of them under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The ED has also filed an application for the confiscation of property belonging to a deceased accused. The defense has denied the allegations and claimed that the money seized was not proceeds of crime.

The court order discusses the provisional attachment orders that were confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority. The accused were charged with money-laundering under the PMLA, and it was argued that the money and car seized during the investigation be confiscated to the Central Government as proceeds of crime. The defense argued that the accused were falsely implicated and the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court analyzed the evidence produced on record and discussed the relevant provisions of the PMLA, including the definition of proceeds of crime and scheduled offences. The court ultimately ordered that the property involved in the money-laundering or used for commission of the offence of money-laundering be confiscated to the Central Government.

The court order states that if a trial under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) finds that money laundering has not taken place or the property is not involved in money laundering, the property shall be released to the rightful claimant. However, if the trial concludes that money laundering has taken place, the property involved in money laundering shall be confiscated to the Central Government. The order also discusses the evidence presented in a specific case involving the recovery of proceeds of crime derived from illegal wildlife trade, which is a scheduled offence under PMLA. The prosecution presented testimony from witnesses and statements from the accused to prove the recovery of the proceeds of crime, while the defense argued that there were contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence.

The court order states that omissions or contradictions in prosecution evidence do not necessarily render it unacceptable, unless they create serious doubts about the truthfulness or creditworthiness of the witnesses. Only serious contradictions and omissions that affect the core of the prosecution case can prove fatal to the prosecution. Confessional statements made to Customs Officers can be admissible in evidence and form the basis for conviction, but must be voluntary and truthful, and require corroboration from other evidence. Similarly, statements made by the accused in proceedings under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act cannot constitute the sole basis for recording a finding of guilt.

The court order discusses the use of oral statements as evidence in a case and the need for independent corroboration. The court examines various pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution, including a retracted confession and testimony from witnesses, to determine if the charges against the accused can be established. The court ultimately finds that certain evidence is sufficient to prove the charges, including the recovery of wildlife contraband and cash from the accused's possession. The court also notes that statements recorded during the investigation are admissible in evidence.

The court order discusses the statements of accused individuals and witnesses in a case involving the illegal trade of wildlife contraband. The court finds that Rs. 2,70,000 recovered from a car is proceeds of crime, but the ownership of the car itself cannot be established as such. The court also examines the seizure of Rs. 50 lacs from the house of a deceased accused individual, and while the prosecution argues that it is proceeds of crime, the defense argues that it belongs to the accused's wife. The court examines the evidence and testimony presented and ultimately finds that the money cannot be established as proceeds of crime.

The court order discusses the circumstances surrounding the recovery of Rs. 50 lakhs in cash and wildlife contraband from the house of deceased accused Surajpal @ Chacha. The court finds that the statements of the accused persons recorded under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and PMLA are admissible in evidence and relevant to prove the character of the recovered cash. The court also cites the Sansar Chand Vs. State of
