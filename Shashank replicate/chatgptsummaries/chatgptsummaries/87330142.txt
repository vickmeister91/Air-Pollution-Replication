The court order pertains to six different cases involving disputes over land ownership and acquisition in the city of Gulbarga, Karnataka. The first case involves four writ appeals filed by The Corporation of City of Gulbarga and The State of Karnataka against various respondents. The appeals seek to set aside the order/judgment passed by the learned single judge of the court in writ petitions and dismiss the writ petitions with costs. The respondents include individuals and government authorities. The details of the respondents and their occupations are mentioned in the order.

The second case is related to a writ appeal filed by the State of Karnataka against a judgment and order passed by a learned single judge in a writ petition. The petitioners had prayed for setting aside an order issued by the State of Karnataka and for direction to the respondent - Gulbarga Mahanagara Palike to implement their resolution. The court heard the arguments of both parties and went through the entire record and judgments of this Court and the Supreme Court. The court deemed it appropriate to state in detail the sequence of events/facts, which in their opinion, would support the view that they are taking in these appeals. The court then narrated the facts and events related to the land involved in the appeals and concluded that the impugned order was wrong. The court allowed the writ appeal and dismissed the writ petitions with costs.

The third case requires the Corporation and the concerned party to settle their dispute amicably, with the concerned party retaining 14 plots of land and withdrawing all cases pending before the Civil Court and City Survey Office. The Corporation is allowed to deal with the remaining plots and open space. The concerned party is entitled to have their name entered in the Corporation records and is free to deal with the 14 plots retained by them. The order was made to resolve a long-standing litigation over the land. The order was challenged in writ petitions filed by 14 petitioners. The learned Single Judge observed that the Corporation could not take possession of the land due to a series of litigations.

The fourth case discusses a dispute between the Corporation of City of Gulbarga and the erstwhile owner of a property, Seshagiri Rao. The Corporation agreed to let Rao retain 14 plots of land, and the Commissioner of the Corporation filed a petition to transfer the plots to Rao's name. The State Government subsequently passed an order to review the transfer, but the court found that there was no evidence of fraud and that the compromise was approved by the government. The court also found that the Corporation had taken possession of the land in question and that the acquisition was completed in 1947-48. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners who had purchased the plots from Rao.

The fifth case discusses a case where fraud was committed in the acquisition of land by Sri Seshagiri Rao and interested parties in the Corporation. The court found that the Corporation and the Government were misled by false information and that the first order passed by the Government was obtained by fraud. The court also found that the principles of natural justice were not violated as even if the petitioners were granted a hearing, it would be an empty formality. The court ultimately set aside the impugned order and held that the interest of the people at large is paramount over the interest of any individual.

The sixth case discusses the principles of natural justice and the power of the government to cancel resolutions or orders passed by the Corporation. The court concludes that the principles of natural justice need not be observed in this case as the petitioners claiming interest in the property acquired it through a person who had no authority in law. The court also states that the government has the power to cancel resolutions or orders if they are in contravention of the law or prejudicial to the interest of the Corporation. The court rejects the petitioners' claim to ownership of the land and suggests that they should proceed against the landlord or the Corporation for appropriate relief.

In all six cases, the court order allows the appeals and sets aside the previous order passed by the learned Single Judge. The order passed by the Government is confirmed. The petitioners are allowed to file proceedings for appropriate relief, but the court does not recognize any rights of the petitioners in that regard. Any such proceedings will be considered on merits in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court order deals with various disputes over land ownership and acquisition in Gulbarga, Karnataka. The court has carefully considered the facts and events related to each case and has made its decision based on the evidence presented. The court has also emphasized the importance of natural justice and the interest of the people at large in these cases. The order provides a resolution to long-standing litigations and allows the concerned parties to deal with the land in question in accordance with the law.
