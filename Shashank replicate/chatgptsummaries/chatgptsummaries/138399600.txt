The case in question involves a petition filed by Vinoda under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner sought to quash an order dated 16.11.2013 made on the application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in S.C.No.5009/2012. The petitioner was seeking particulars of two SIM numbers belonging to Nagamma and Jagadish, which were used by the deceased Sunanda at the time of her death.

The learned Sessions Judge dismissed the application on the ground that the petitioner had not sought specific documents with reference to the two SIMs. However, the High Court allowed the petition and directed the Sessions Judge to secure and furnish to the petitioner the particulars with reference to the use of the two numbers for the relevant period.

The case raises several important legal issues, including the scope of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the extent to which a petitioner can seek information under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner sought to use this provision to quash an order made under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, the petitioner sought particulars of two SIM numbers under this provision.

The learned Sessions Judge dismissed the application on the ground that the petitioner had not sought specific documents with reference to the two SIMs. However, the High Court disagreed with this interpretation and allowed the petition. The High Court directed the Sessions Judge to secure and furnish to the petitioner the particulars with reference to the use of the two numbers for the relevant period.

The High Court's decision raises important questions about the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to seek particulars of the two SIM numbers under this provision, even if she had not specified the exact documents she was seeking. This interpretation of Section 91 could have significant implications for future cases where parties seek information under this provision.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the need for a broad interpretation of Section 91 to ensure that parties have access to the information they need to pursue their cases effectively.
