The University of Agricultural Sciences and the Judicial Layout Residents and Site Holders Association have reached a settlement in a case regarding a public road. The University had filed an appeal against a judgment and decree passed in a suit filed by the Association, which declared the road as public and granted a permanent injunction against the University and others from obstructing the use of the road. The parties have now agreed to use the road for ingress and egress, asphalt the road, provide necessary drains, install a gate with a security guard, and allow only light motor vehicles between 5:30 am to 7:30 pm. The University will bear the cost of maintenance and asphalting of the road. The parties have filed a joint memo requesting the court to decree the suit as per the terms of the settlement.

The court order states that the University must provide necessary drains and asphalt the road within a reasonable period while forming a 20 feet width and 300 feet length road. Both parties agree to install a gate with appropriate height and depute a security guard. Light motor vehicles are allowed to use the road between 5.30 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. every day, and there will be no restraint for residents to use the road for morning and evening walks or to visit the temple, post office, etc. The University will issue identity cards to residents for using the road if necessary. The order is disposed of, and the parties agree to produce a copy of the order before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal for necessary modification. The court appreciates the service rendered by the learned counsel for both parties and the Estate Officer of the University.
