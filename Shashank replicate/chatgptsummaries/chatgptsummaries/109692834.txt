The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by the applicants against an order passed by the Fourth Additional Sessions Judge in Ratlam in Sessions Trial No. 290/2016. The applicants had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which was subsequently rejected by the trial court. The applicants then filed a revision petition against this order.

The learned counsel for the applicants argued that the trial court had dismissed their application, which was the reason for the revision petition. However, the learned Public Prosecutor opposed the prayer, stating that the revision petition was not maintainable as it was filed against an interlocutory order.

The court considered the arguments put forth by both parties and ultimately dismissed the revision petition. The reason for this was that the petition was filed against an interlocutory order, which is not appealable under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court held that the revision petition was not maintainable and therefore could not be entertained.

This court order highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the order being challenged before filing a revision petition. In this case, the applicants had filed a revision petition against an interlocutory order, which is not appealable under the Code of Criminal Procedure. As a result, their petition was dismissed.

It is important for litigants to carefully consider the nature of the order being challenged before filing any petitions or appeals. This can save time and resources, as well as prevent unnecessary delays in the legal process. In this case, the applicants could have avoided filing a revision petition against an interlocutory order if they had understood the limitations of such petitions under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to litigants and legal practitioners alike to carefully consider the nature of the order being challenged before filing any petitions or appeals. It also highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of different legal remedies under the relevant laws and regulations.
