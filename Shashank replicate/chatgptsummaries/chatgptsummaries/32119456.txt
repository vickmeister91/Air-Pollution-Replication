The court order in question relates to a writ petition filed by a man named Jaimson, who alleged police harassment. According to the petitioner, he had filed a private complaint against some private respondents, which was registered on January 30th, 2014. He claimed that police personnel were coming to his shop every day, which he considered to be harassment.

Upon examining the case, the court found that the petitioner had been issued a notice in connection with further investigation, which is permissible under the law. As such, the court determined that any challenge to the said proceedings could not be entertained in this writ petition alleging police harassment. Consequently, the writ petition was closed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the legal procedures involved in filing complaints and seeking redress for grievances. While it is understandable that Jaimson felt harassed by the police's frequent visits to his shop, it is important to note that the police have the right to investigate complaints and gather evidence as part of their duties.

In this case, the court found that the notice issued to Jaimson was a legitimate part of the investigation process, and therefore could not be challenged in a writ petition alleging police harassment. This underscores the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities when dealing with law enforcement agencies.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision in this case does not necessarily mean that Jaimson's complaint against the private respondents was without merit. Rather, it simply means that the court could not entertain his writ petition alleging police harassment in this particular instance.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the legal system and the procedures involved in seeking justice. While it can be frustrating to feel like one's rights are being violated, it is important to approach such situations with a clear understanding of the law and the options available for seeking redress.
