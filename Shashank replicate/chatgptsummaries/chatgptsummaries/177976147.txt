The court has issued a series of orders pertaining to the Nandan Kanan Wild Life Sanctuary in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. The first order was in response to a petition filed by Sri Zakir Khan, a social activist, seeking a ban on all construction activities within a 1 km radius of the sanctuary. The petitioner argued that such activities were putting severe strain on the eco-system and could lead to permanent and irreparable damages. The court heard arguments from both the petitioner and the state authorities and noted that the large-scale construction activities in the close vicinity of the sanctuary areas were bound to cause adverse impacts on the local ecology. The court ordered the state authorities to prepare an action plan based on environmental study to create a green corridor and ban construction activity in the close vicinity of the sanctuary.

The second court order pertains to the land acquisition of private land within the limits of Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary. The court has been informed that large-scale construction activities close to the sanctuary area and zoo will adversely affect the local ecology, and a green belt of buffer zone is desirable for maintaining proper ambience in the vicinity of the zoo. The court has also been informed that the State Pollution Control Board has no jurisdiction over the alleged construction work. The court has considered various contentions made by the parties and has directed the opposite parties to take immediate steps to stop all plotting schemes and construction activities within one kilometre radius all around the Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary. The court has also directed the opposite parties to conduct an environmental study and prepare an environmental management plan to save the ecology in and around the sanctuary area from further degradation.

The third court order discusses a petition seeking a direction to declare an area around Nandankanan Zoo as a green belt area due to its proximity to a protected wildlife sanctuary. The court directed the government advocate to file an affidavit indicating whether the state government intends to acquire the area and what steps have been taken pursuant to a notification dated 03.01.1988. The Director of Nandankanan Zoological Park stated in an affidavit that there is no proposal to acquire the land within a 1 km radius of the park for a green belt. The court held that a right to hold property is a constitutional and human right and that if there is any violation of environmental laws, the concerned authorities are free to take necessary action. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly.

In summary, the court has issued orders to protect the Nandan Kanan Wild Life Sanctuary and its surrounding areas from construction activities that could harm the local ecology. The court has directed the state authorities to prepare an action plan based on environmental study to create a green corridor and ban construction activity in the close vicinity of the sanctuary. The court has also directed the opposite parties to take immediate steps to stop all plotting schemes and construction activities within one kilometre radius all around the Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary and to conduct an environmental study and prepare an environmental management plan to save the ecology in and around the sanctuary area from further degradation. The court has also considered a petition seeking a direction to declare an area around Nandankanan Zoo as a green belt area and held that a right to hold property is a constitutional and human right and that if there is any violation of environmental laws, the concerned authorities are free to take necessary action.
