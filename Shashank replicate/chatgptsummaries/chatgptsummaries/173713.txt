The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case challenging an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Vankaner, and the order passed in Criminal Revision Application No. 16 of 1999. The petitioners argued that they were not in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the company and therefore could not be subjected to prosecution for offences under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. However, the court rejected the petitioners' argument and upheld the orders passed by the lower courts.

The court examined Section 17 of the Act, which states that in the absence of a nominated person responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the company, every person in charge of the company at the time of the offence is deemed guilty and liable to be punished. The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 17(2) and the duty of companies to nominate responsible persons for the conduct of their business. The court cites previous cases and legal principles to argue that the provision is not merely enabling, but carries a compulsory force.

The court also notes that the burden of proof is on the accused to show that they did not know of the offense or exercised due diligence to prevent it. In this case, the petitioners failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that they were not in charge of the company's day-to-day affairs. Therefore, the court upheld the lower courts' orders and denied the petitioners' request for discharge.

The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent the adulteration of food and ensure that food products are safe for consumption. The Act imposes strict liability on companies and individuals who violate its provisions. Section 17 of the Act is particularly important as it holds every person in charge of the company at the time of the offence liable for prosecution.

The court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of companies nominating responsible persons for the conduct of their business. It also highlights the need for individuals to exercise due diligence in ensuring that their company complies with the provisions of the Act. The burden of proof is on the accused to show that they did not know of the offense or exercised due diligence to prevent it. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to take proactive steps to prevent violations of the Act.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's decision in this case is a significant development in the interpretation of Section 17 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The court's decision reinforces the importance of companies nominating responsible persons for the conduct of their business and highlights the need for individuals to exercise due diligence in ensuring compliance with the Act. The burden of proof is on the accused to show that they did not know of the offense or exercised due diligence to prevent it. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to take proactive steps to prevent violations of the Act.
