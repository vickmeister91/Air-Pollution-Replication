Three court orders related to wildlife protection act cases have been summarized. The first order acquitted three accused, Ashok Kumar, Nand Kumar, and Naresh Kumar, of charges under the Wildlife Protection Act for possessing a baby leopard skin. The case was remanded back to the court for further examination of witnesses and contradictions in the seizure memo. The court found inconsistencies in the evidence presented by the prosecution witnesses, including the color and markings of the skin, and the mention of the FIR number in the seizure memo. Ultimately, the court found the accused not guilty.

The second court order discusses the testimony of various witnesses in a case involving the recovery of a leopard skin. The prosecution argues that the witnesses have proven their case beyond reasonable doubt, while the defense argues that there are contradictions and doubts in the testimony. The court notes that the identification of the skin as that of a leopard cub requires an expert witness, and questions whether the Wildlife Inspector who identified the skin is truly an expert. The court ultimately does not come to a conclusion on the case.

The third court order discusses the admissibility of expert witness testimony under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act. It notes that an expert witness is not a witness of fact, but rather provides scientific criteria for the judge to form an independent judgment. The order also discusses the importance of using specific techniques for identifying wildlife articles, such as morphological analysis and microscopic examination. Ultimately, the court finds that the complainant failed to prove that the accused possessed skin of a wildlife animal, and acquits them of the charges. The case property, if any, is to be confiscated to the state under the Wildlife (Protection) Act.
