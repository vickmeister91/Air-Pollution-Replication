The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to environmental laws and pollution control in Tamil Nadu, India. The first order involves a writ petition filed by Madurai Coats Private Limited challenging an order from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to segregate high TDS effluent and provide a Mechanical Evaporator within six months. The petitioner argued that they had consistently met all effluent discharge parameters as prescribed by the TNPCB. However, the court found that the TNPCB had the power to make, vary, or revoke any order for the prevention, control, or abatement of discharges of waste into streams or wells. The purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act is to prevent and control water pollution and to maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order discusses a case involving a unit that discharges treated effluent into a river. The TNPCB has been monitoring the unit to ensure that the effluent is not discharged into the river when there is no flow or when the flow is less than ten times the flow of effluent from the industry. The court dismissed a writ petition filed against this direction. The court also found that the unit had accepted an option to segregate high TDS effluent and evaporation but had not taken any steps to do so. The Anna University report found that the discharge of inorganic salts into the river could be avoided by segregating high TDS effluent streams and their treatment by evaporation. The court held that the Pollution Control Board has the power to make, vary, or revoke any order for the prevention, control, or abatement of discharges of waste into streams or wells. The purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act is to prevent and control water pollution and to maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water.

The third court order discusses various judgments related to environmental laws and pollution control. It emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the duty of the State and citizens to maintain a hygienic environment. The court also gives directions regarding the operation of effluent treatment and R.O. Plants for tanneries in Erode District. The order highlights the need for strict action against those who discharge noxious polluting effluents into water bodies, which affects public health.

The fourth court order directs the creation of new posts in the District Environmental Engineer's office and for the State Government to approve the proposal for additional staff in the Erode District. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is instructed to ensure that Tie & Dye and Printing Units adopt adequate treatment to protect water sources and to review chlorine use and storage procedures. The Public Works Department is directed to review water drawal permissions and examine the issue of remediating polluted water bodies. The TNPCB is instructed to identify units producing more than permitted and take action to close them. A committee is to be set up for coordinated action against defaulting units. The writ petition is dismissed.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of environmental laws and pollution control in Tamil Nadu. The TNPCB has the power to make, vary, or revoke any order for the prevention, control, or abatement of discharges of waste into streams or wells. The purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act is to prevent and control water pollution and to maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water. The court emphasizes the duty of the State and citizens to maintain a hygienic environment and takes strict action against those who discharge noxious polluting effluents into water bodies, which affects public health. The court also directs various departments to take action to protect water sources and remediate polluted water bodies.
