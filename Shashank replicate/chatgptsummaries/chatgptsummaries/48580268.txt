The court order pertains to a challenge by Arcelormittal India Pvt Ltd & Anr against an order dated 17th July, 2018 of the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) 1376/2017. The challenge was primarily because of an objection of availability of alternative remedy under Section 2 (A) of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 taken by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent nos. 1 and 2. The court found that the remedy of appeal is not available to the appellants as the State Government has not passed an order directing any of the four eventualities contemplated under Section 2 of the Act. Additionally, the NGT would not have the jurisdiction to entertain the appeal filed by the appellants.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The order states that any person aggrieved by an order or decision made by the State Government or other authority under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 can appeal to the NGT within 30 days. The NGT may allow an appeal to be filed within a further period not exceeding 60 days if the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the initial 30-day period. The order also cites previous judgments to support the argument that an appeal flows from a statute and if the statute does not provide an appeal against a specific order, no appeal can be entertained. The order concludes that under Section 16(e) of the NGT Act, an appeal is provided for only against an order passed by the State Government or other authorities, and the order of approval/clearance passed by the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act is beyond the scope of appeal.

The court order refers to a previous case where it was established that appeals can only be made against orders passed by state governments or other authorities, not the central government. However, if a party is aggrieved by an approval or clearance granted by the central government, they can file an appeal against the order passed by the state government. The court sets aside the impugned order and remands the matter back to the learned Single Judge for a decision on merit. The petition stands disposed of.
