The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner and an accused were alleged to have misused their official positions by signing incomplete affidavits. The petitioner filed an application under section 311 CrPC for recalling PW1, the sanctioning authority, for further cross-examination, which was dismissed by the Ld. Special Judge, CBI. The petitioner contended that the sanction granted by the sanctioning authority was without application of mind and passed in a mechanical manner. The court found no infirmity with the order of the Ld. Special Judge in dismissing the application. The court also observed that a sanction order is merely an administrative order and the sanctioning authority need not sift and weigh evidence meticulously while granting sanction.

The court order discusses the use of section 540 CrPC, which allows the court to summon witnesses or recall/re-examine witnesses already examined if it is necessary for a just decision of the case. The court notes that this power should not be misused to frustrate the purpose of the law. The court also distinguishes this case from previous cases where witnesses were recalled, stating that the witness in this case has already undergone a detailed cross-examination and further cross-examination of the sanctioning authority is not essential for a just decision. The court finds no infirmity in the order of the Ld. Special Judge and dismisses the petition.
