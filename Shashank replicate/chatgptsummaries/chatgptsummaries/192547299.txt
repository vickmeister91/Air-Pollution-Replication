The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of a village in Gujarat, India, against a stone crushing unit operated by respondents No. 6, 7, and 8. The petitioners allege environmental pollution and health hazards caused by the unit's mining activities. The petitioners have requested the court to issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order, or direction to quash and set aside the impugned order passed by respondent No. 3 and 4, allowing the mining activities to restart. They have also requested the court to direct the Collector, Sabarkantha, to cancel the mining lease in question of the respondent Nos. 6, 7, and 8.

The court has summarized the origin and genesis of the public interest litigation and the relevant facts of the case. The quarry lease was granted by the respondent State Authority in Block No. 651 of Village Prempur, adjoining agricultural lands. The Gujarat State Pollution Control Board cancelled the Consolidated Consent and Authorization (C.C.A.) of respondent Nos. 6 to 8 for causing pollution in the area. The petitioners argue that the authorities have granted permission to start a quarry in violation of earlier court orders, which stated that the crushing unit should not cause pollution or affect agricultural fields or human habitation. The petitioners also claim that the blasting operations have caused damage to residential houses and religious places.

The respondents argue that the distance between the site and the residential locality is safe and that necessary permissions have been obtained. They rely on Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966, which state that no blasting or mining operations should be allowed within 200 meters of certain areas. The court heard arguments from various parties, including the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the quarry's partner, and ultimately found that the quarry had taken adequate measures to comply with regulations and prevent pollution. The court also noted previous litigation regarding the distance between the crusher and human habitation, but did not address this issue in the current case. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had previously cancelled the quarry's consent and authorization, but later granted a new lease.

The court found that the Board had ignored a Supreme Court decision stating that a safe distance between a crushing unit and residential area should be 1 km. The court also found that the Board had misinterpreted Rule 22(vii) of the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966, which only applies to distances from railway lines, reservoirs, canals, roads, and public works or buildings, and does not address distances from residential areas. The court noted that there is no unified policy or guidelines from the Board regarding distances from residential areas, and that the Board only seems to consider pollution control measures when granting permission for quarry units to operate.

The court order requires the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to create a comprehensive program for preventing, controlling, and abating air pollution. The order also sets a quantitative standard for suspended particulate matter and suggests the creation of guidelines for industrial units to follow. The Board is authorized to inspect control equipment, industrial plants, and manufacturing processes and to give directions for preventing pollution. The Board is also authorized to lay down standards for emission of air pollution and to perform other necessary acts for carrying out the purposes of the Air and Water Act. Section 31(A) of the Air Act gives the Board the power to give directions.

The court order discusses Section 31(A) of the Air Act, which gives the Board the authority to issue directions in writing to any person, officer, or authority, and such person must comply with the directions. The Board can issue directions relating to closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry, operation, or process, and can also direct an existing unit to shift its location. The court orders the Board to immediately frame appropriate guidelines for granting permission to start quarry operation units, taking into account various factors such as standards of quality of air and water, concentration of various pollutions, and proximity to protected areas and human settlements. The court also notes the serious pollution caused by stone crushing industries and quotes a Karnataka High Court decision on the harmful effects of air pollution on lungs.

The court order states that long-term exposure to air pollution, particularly from stone crushing, can cause chronic bronchitis, airway obstruction, allergic reactions, fibrosis, and even lung cancer. The order also highlights the duty of the state to regulate such businesses and protect the health of humans, animals, and vegetation. The right to life, as enshrined in the Constitution of India, includes the right to live in a healthy environment free from pollution. However, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions and the needs of society. The court recognizes the importance of industrial development but also emphasizes the need to protect the environment. The court cites previous cases that highlight the importance of environmental protection and the consequences of not doing so. The court emphasizes the need for long-term planning to preserve natural resources for future generations.

The court order discusses the urgent need to protect the environment and prevent the extinction of species due to uncontrolled growth and environmental deterioration. The court emphasizes the importance of considering relevant factors and excluding irrelevant ones when making decisions that may affect the environment. The court also cites a previous ruling that enterprises engaged in hazardous or dangerous activities have an obligation to ensure the safety of those affected by their activities and may be liable for any harm caused. The court concludes that the state has a constitutional obligation to provide safeguards for protecting the life and
