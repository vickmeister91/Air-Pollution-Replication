The Jammu & Kashmir High Court recently rejected a petition filed by M/s Choudhary Poultry Farm challenging an order issued by the J&K Pollution Control Board to close the farm and snap its electric supply. The court ruled that the poultry unit is a plant as defined under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and cannot operate without consent to establish and operate granted by the State Pollution Control Board. 

The petitioner had argued that the State Pollution Control Board had ceased to have jurisdiction over the matter and that it could only be taken up by the Central Board. However, the court rejected this argument and held that the State Pollution Control Board still had jurisdiction over the matter. 

Despite this ruling, the court allowed the petitioner to continue operating for three months subject to certain conditions. This decision was made in order to give the petitioner time to obtain the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the poultry farm was operating without the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board. The court held that the farm was a plant as defined under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and therefore required consent to establish and operate from the State Pollution Control Board. 

The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the State Pollution Control Board had ceased to have jurisdiction over the matter and that it could only be taken up by the Central Board. The court held that the State Pollution Control Board still had jurisdiction over the matter and that the petitioner was required to obtain the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board. 

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to continue operating for three months subject to certain conditions was made in order to give the petitioner time to obtain the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had already invested a significant amount of money in the poultry farm and that shutting it down immediately would cause significant financial losses. 

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board before operating any plant or industry. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations in order to protect the environment and public health. 

In conclusion, the Jammu & Kashmir High Court's decision to reject the petition filed by M/s Choudhary Poultry Farm and to allow the petitioner to continue operating for three months subject to certain conditions highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and licenses from the State Pollution Control Board before operating any plant or industry. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations in order to protect the environment and public health.
