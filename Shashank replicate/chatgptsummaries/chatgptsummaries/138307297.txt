In a recent court case, Sanjeev Sharma filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge dated 22nd July 2009 in criminal revision. The order directed Car No.DL9CD-2438 to be released on superdari in favour of respondent No.2. The car was found in possession of the petitioner, who claimed to have purchased it from respondent No.2. 

The court found that the impugned order was bad in law as it ignored the fact that respondent No.2 had sold the car to the petitioner. The court set aside the order and directed respondent No.2 to surrender the car to the police within seven days. This decision was made after careful consideration of the evidence presented in the case.

The petitioner, Sanjeev Sharma, argued that he had purchased the car from respondent No.2 and had all the necessary documents to prove it. He claimed that he was not aware that the car was involved in any criminal activity and had purchased it in good faith. The court found that the petitioner had indeed purchased the car from respondent No.2 and had all the necessary documents to prove it.

The court also found that the impugned order was bad in law as it ignored the fact that respondent No.2 had sold the car to the petitioner. The court held that the order was passed without considering the evidence presented by the petitioner and was therefore bad in law. The court set aside the order and directed respondent No.2 to surrender the car to the police within seven days.

The court's decision was based on the principle of justice and fairness. The court recognized that the petitioner had purchased the car in good faith and had all the necessary documents to prove it. The court also recognized that the impugned order was passed without considering the evidence presented by the petitioner. The court's decision was therefore aimed at correcting the injustice that had been done to the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the principles of justice and fairness. The court recognized that the petitioner had purchased the car in good faith and had all the necessary documents to prove it. The court also recognized that the impugned order was passed without considering the evidence presented by the petitioner. The court's decision was aimed at correcting the injustice that had been done to the petitioner and ensuring that justice was served.
