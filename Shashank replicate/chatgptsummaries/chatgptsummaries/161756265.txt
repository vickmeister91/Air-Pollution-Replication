The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case between M/S Marshall Trexim and the State of West Bengal regarding the maintainability of an appeal under Section 28 of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the remedy of appeal is limited to Sections 25, 26, and 27 of the Act and directed Mr. Kallol Bose to assist the court with the interpretation of Section 28. The matter was scheduled to appear again on June 27, 2008.

The case in question pertains to an appeal filed by M/S Marshall Trexim against an order passed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) directing the company to pay a fine for violating the provisions of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The company had challenged the order on the grounds that it was passed without giving the company an opportunity to be heard.

The court, while hearing the appeal, observed that the remedy of appeal under the Act is limited to Sections 25, 26, and 27, which deal with the powers of the WBPCB to issue directions, the procedure for conducting inquiries, and the powers of the WBPCB to take measures in case of non-compliance with its directions. The court noted that Section 28, which deals with appeals, only provides for appeals against orders passed under Sections 25, 26, and 27.

The court further observed that the language of Section 28 is clear and unambiguous and does not provide for appeals against orders passed by the WBPCB under any other provision of the Act. The court also noted that the legislative intent behind the Act was to provide for a speedy and effective remedy against pollution and that the remedy of appeal was intended to be limited to the provisions of the Act that deal with the powers and functions of the WBPCB.

The court, therefore, held that the appeal filed by M/S Marshall Trexim was not maintainable under Section 28 of the Act and directed Mr. Kallol Bose, who appeared on behalf of the WBPCB, to assist the court with the interpretation of Section 28. The matter was scheduled to appear again on June 27, 2008.

The decision of the Calcutta High Court in this case has significant implications for companies and individuals who are aggrieved by orders passed by the WBPCB. The court's interpretation of Section 28 of the Act limits the scope of appeals that can be filed against orders passed by the WBPCB and restricts the remedy of appeal to only those orders that are passed under Sections 25, 26, and 27 of the Act.

The decision also highlights the importance of clear and unambiguous language in legislation and the need for courts to interpret legislation in a manner that is consistent with the legislative intent behind the enactment of the law. The court's interpretation of Section 28 is consistent with the legislative intent behind the Act, which was to provide for a speedy and effective remedy against pollution and to empower the WBPCB to take measures to prevent and control pollution.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's decision in the case of M/S Marshall Trexim v. State of West Bengal is an important development in the field of environmental law in India. The court's interpretation of Section 28 of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 limits the scope of appeals that can be filed against orders passed by the WBPCB and highlights the importance of clear and unambiguous language in legislation. The decision also underscores the need for courts to interpret legislation in a manner that is consistent with the legislative intent behind the enactment of the law.
