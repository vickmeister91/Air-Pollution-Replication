The State had appealed against the acquittal of the respondents for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and IPC Section 379. The case involved the possession of deer skin and horns of endangered species without a license or permit. The court examined whether the investigation and trial were lawful under Section 55 of the Act, which states that no court shall take cognizance of any offence against the Act except on the complaint of certain authorized persons. The court found that a police report was not sufficient and that a complaint must be submitted to the Magistrate for investigation. As such, the court held that the investigation was not lawful and set aside the acquittal.

The court order clarifies that only officers named in Section 55 can submit a complaint for the court to take cognizance, and not final reports submitted by police officials under Section 173. In this case, the officer who submitted the complaint did not have the competence to do so, and the jurisdictional magistrate failed to examine whether he was competent. Therefore, the entire process of investigation and trial is vitiated, and the acquittal of the respondent is justified. The appeal is dismissed.
