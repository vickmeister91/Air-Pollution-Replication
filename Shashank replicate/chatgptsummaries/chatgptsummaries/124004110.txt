The Patna High Court has granted bail to Sangeeta Devi and Amrendra Paswan in anticipation of their arrest in connection with a case involving unauthorized extraction of sand. The court considered the fact that the petitioners had no criminal antecedents and that their implication in the case may be false. The petitioners were directed to be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount.

The case involved allegations of unauthorized extraction of sand, which is a common issue in many parts of India. The petitioners, Sangeeta Devi and Amrendra Paswan, were accused of being involved in the illegal extraction of sand from a riverbed. The case was registered against them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The petitioners approached the Patna High Court seeking anticipatory bail, as they feared arrest in connection with the case. The court considered their plea and observed that the petitioners had no criminal antecedents and that their implication in the case may be false. The court also noted that the investigation in the case was still ongoing and that the petitioners had cooperated with the authorities during the investigation.

The court further observed that the allegations against the petitioners were not of a serious nature and that they were not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court, therefore, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners and directed them to be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioners is significant as it highlights the importance of considering the individual circumstances of each case while deciding on bail applications. The court took into account the fact that the petitioners had no criminal antecedents and that their implication in the case may be false. This shows that the court is willing to consider the possibility of false implication and is not quick to assume guilt.

The court's decision also highlights the need for a balanced approach while dealing with cases of unauthorized extraction of sand. While such activities are illegal and harmful to the environment, it is important to ensure that the accused are not falsely implicated and that their rights are protected.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Sangeeta Devi and Amrendra Paswan in connection with a case involving unauthorized extraction of sand is a welcome move. The court's decision shows that it is willing to consider the individual circumstances of each case while deciding on bail applications and that it is committed to protecting the rights of the accused. The decision also highlights the need for a balanced approach while dealing with cases of unauthorized extraction of sand.
