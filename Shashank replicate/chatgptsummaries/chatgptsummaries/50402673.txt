The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Virender Kumar against the order of the trial court dismissing his application seeking an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant in a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The trial court had observed that the accused had sufficient opportunity to establish his defense but did not do so. However, the revision petition was accepted subject to the payment of a cost of Rs. 1000/- and the court allowed the accused to cross-examine the complainant and lead defense evidence if any on a subsequent date.

The case in question involves a complaint filed by the complainant against the accused for dishonoring a cheque issued by the accused. The complainant alleged that the accused had issued a cheque for a certain amount, which was dishonored by the bank due to insufficient funds. The complainant further alleged that despite repeated requests, the accused failed to make the payment, which led to the filing of the complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

During the trial, the accused had sought an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant, which was denied by the trial court. The trial court observed that the accused had sufficient opportunity to establish his defense but did not do so. The accused then filed a revision petition before the higher court challenging the order of the trial court.

The higher court, after considering the submissions made by both parties, observed that the accused had a right to cross-examine the complainant and lead defense evidence if any. The court noted that the right to cross-examine the witness is a fundamental right of the accused and cannot be denied unless there are compelling reasons to do so. The court further observed that the accused had not been given a proper opportunity to cross-examine the complainant and therefore, the order of the trial court was not sustainable.

The court, however, imposed a cost of Rs. 1000/- on the accused for filing a frivolous application before the trial court. The court noted that the accused had not made any effort to cross-examine the complainant during the trial and had only sought an opportunity to do so after the trial was over. The court observed that such conduct on the part of the accused was not acceptable and therefore, a cost was imposed on him.

In conclusion, the court order in question highlights the importance of the right to cross-examine the witness in a criminal trial. The accused has a fundamental right to cross-examine the witness and lead defense evidence if any. The court has also emphasized the need for the accused to make a genuine effort to establish his defense during the trial and not wait until the trial is over to seek an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The imposition of a cost on the accused for filing a frivolous application also serves as a deterrent for such conduct in the future.
