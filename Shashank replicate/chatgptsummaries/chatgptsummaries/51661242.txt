In a recent court order, a petitioner who is the registered owner of a car seized by Anchal Forest Officials has approached the court against the order passed by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II (Forest Offences), Punalur. The court directed the petitioner to furnish cash security or Demand Draft or bank guarantee for an amount of Rs.5,04,200/- being the value of the vehicle. The petitioner contended that the order passed is legally unsustainable. 

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, set aside Condition No.(1) in the above order and instead directed the petitioner to execute a bond for Rs.5,04,200/- with two sureties for the same amount before the court below and comply with other conditions in the order. This decision was made after considering the legal arguments presented by both parties and the relevant laws and regulations.

The petitioner had argued that the order passed by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II (Forest Offences), Punalur was legally unsustainable. The court, however, found that the order was legally valid and enforceable. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions set forth in the order, which had led to the seizure of the vehicle.

The court's decision to set aside Condition No.(1) in the order and instead direct the petitioner to execute a bond with two sureties was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to comply with the original conditions set forth in the order. The court found that the petitioner had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim that the order was legally unsustainable.

The court's decision to require the petitioner to execute a bond with two sureties was based on the fact that the value of the vehicle was significant. The court found that the bond would provide sufficient security for the value of the vehicle and ensure that the petitioner complied with the conditions set forth in the order.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the legal arguments presented by both parties and the relevant laws and regulations. The court found that the order passed by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II (Forest Offences), Punalur was legally valid and enforceable, and that the petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions set forth in the order. The court's decision to set aside Condition No.(1) in the order and instead direct the petitioner to execute a bond with two sureties was based on the fact that the value of the vehicle was significant and that the bond would provide sufficient security for the value of the vehicle.
