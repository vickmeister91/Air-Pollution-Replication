In a lawsuit filed by Percy F. Fisher against Ardeshir Hormasji Gazdar, the court has issued an order dismissing the suit with costs. The lawsuit was filed to recover a sum of Rs. 13,350 and interest for moneys lent and advanced to Gazdar at different times in 1920, and for an order for sale of certain shares alleged to have been pledged with Fisher in or about January 1922.

The defendants argued that the suit was barred by limitation, and the issue of limitation was tried as a preliminary issue. The court held that the suit was time-barred and must be dismissed with costs.

The concept of limitation is an important aspect of the legal system. It refers to the time period within which a legal action can be initiated. The purpose of limitation is to ensure that legal disputes are resolved in a timely manner and that evidence is not lost or destroyed over time.

In this case, the defendants argued that the suit was time-barred, meaning that the time period within which the suit could be initiated had expired. The court agreed with the defendants and held that the suit was indeed time-barred.

The court's decision to dismiss the suit with costs means that Fisher will have to bear the expenses of the legal proceedings. This is a common practice in legal proceedings, where the losing party is required to pay the costs of the winning party.

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on the issue of limitation and not on the merits of the case. The court did not consider the evidence presented by either party or make a determination on the validity of Fisher's claim.

In conclusion, the court has issued an order dismissing the lawsuit filed by Percy F. Fisher against Ardeshir Hormasji Gazdar. The court held that the suit was time-barred and must be dismissed with costs. This decision highlights the importance of adhering to the time limits for initiating legal actions and the consequences of failing to do so.
