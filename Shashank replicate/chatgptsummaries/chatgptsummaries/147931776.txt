The court order pertains to six writ appeals filed by three individuals challenging the order-in-original and order passed by the second respondent. The appeals were rejected by the second respondent on the ground of limitation, and the writ petitions were dismissed by the learned Single Judge. The appellants were granted liberty to file statutory appeals before the Tribunal.

The court examined the issue of whether the appeals filed by the appellants within the condonable period could be rejected on the ground that the pre-deposit of 7.5% of the penalty was made after the condonable period had expired. The court discussed the background of the case, including the seizure of gold items and the confiscation of the same by the first respondent. The second respondent rejected the appeals filed by the appellants on the ground of limitation. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petitions, but granted liberty to the appellants to file statutory appeals before the Tribunal.

The court order discusses the issue of limitation and the opportunity given to the appellants to file statutory appeals against the order-in-original and the orders of the second respondent before the Tribunal. The appellants have preferred appeals, and arguments have been advanced by both parties. The appellants argue that the impugned judgment should be set aside on several grounds, while the Revenue resists the appeals.

The court examines the relevant provisions of the 1962 Act and concludes that if an appeal is presented within the original period of limitation or within the condonable period, it cannot be dismissed solely on the ground that the mandatory pre-deposit of duty or penalty or both was not made before the expiry of the period of limitation. The court also suggests that the procedure prescribed in the Circular dated 14.10.2014 could be applied even to appeals preferred before the second respondent.

The court order discusses the provisions for appealing against orders passed by the appropriate authority under various sections of the TNGST Act. The second proviso to Section 31(1) of the TNGST Act prohibits the concerned authority from entertaining an appeal unless it is accompanied by satisfactory proof of payment of admitted tax. The court distinguishes this provision from Section 129 E of the 1962 Act, which pertains to prescribed mandatory pre-deposit of disputed tax/ penalty or both.

The court also cites a Supreme Court judgment in M/s.Ranjit Impex Vs. Appellate Deputy Commissioner and Another, which held that a condition to entertain an appeal does not mean that the memorandum of appeal shall be returned because of non-compliance pertaining to pre-deposit. The court allows the appeals and directs the second respondent to hear the appeals on merits.

In summary, the court order pertains to six writ appeals filed by three individuals challenging the order-in-original and order passed by the second respondent. The appeals were rejected by the second respondent on the ground of limitation, and the writ petitions were dismissed by the learned Single Judge. The appellants were granted liberty to file statutory appeals before the Tribunal.
