The Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board has been at the center of a legal dispute with B.L.A. Power Pvt. Ltd, which filed multiple writ petitions against the board. The dispute arose from a notice issued by the board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The notice was challenged by B.L.A. Power Pvt. Ltd, which sought relief from the court.

During the hearing, the counsel for the respondents informed the court that the notice issued by the board was going to be withdrawn. This development prompted the counsel for the petitioners to seek permission to withdraw the petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. The court granted the prayer, and the petitions were dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge, and to ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. The Act provides for the establishment of biodiversity management committees at the local level, and biodiversity management authorities at the state and national levels. These bodies are responsible for implementing the provisions of the Act, including the issuance of notices under Section 7.

Section 7 of the Act empowers the biodiversity management committees and authorities to issue notices to persons who are suspected of having accessed biological resources or associated knowledge without prior approval. The notice requires the person to show cause why he should not be penalized for the unauthorized access. The Act provides for penalties ranging from imprisonment to fines for violations of its provisions.

The notice issued by the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board under Section 7 was challenged by B.L.A. Power Pvt. Ltd on the grounds that it was issued without proper authority and without following due process. The company argued that it had not accessed any biological resources or associated knowledge without prior approval, and that the notice was therefore baseless.

The court order dismissing the petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed is a significant development in the legal dispute between B.L.A. Power Pvt. Ltd and the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board. It remains to be seen whether the company will take recourse to law afresh, or whether the matter will be resolved through other means.

The case highlights the importance of proper implementation of the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and the need for transparency and due process in the issuance of notices under Section 7. It also underscores the role of the judiciary in ensuring that the rights of all parties are protected, and that justice is done in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court order dismissing the writ petitions filed by B.L.A. Power Pvt. Ltd against the Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board with liberty to file afresh if needed is a significant development in the legal dispute between the parties. The order reflects the importance of proper implementation of the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and the need for transparency and due process in the issuance of notices under Section 7. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in ensuring that justice is done in accordance with the law.
