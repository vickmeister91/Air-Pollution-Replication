The Supreme Court of India recently issued a court order pertaining to four appeals that raised the question of whether a vehicle or vessel seized under Section 50(1)(c) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 can be released by a Magistrate during the pendency of trial under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The State of Madhya Pradesh contended that the answer was no, but the court found this to be untenable. The court examined the relevant provisions of law and found that the Magistrate had the power to release a seized vehicle during the pendency of trial. The court also rejected the State's argument that Section 50 and other provisions in Chapter VI of the Act excluded the application of any provisions of the Code.

The court order states that the deletion of sub-section (2) of Section 50 means that a person must approach the Magistrate directly for interim release of a seized vehicle. The court also notes that a previous decision in Kunchindammed is not applicable to the present case, which arises under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court cites the case of Moti Lal vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. to support the view that Section 50 of the Wild Life Act does not exclude the operation of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court also rejects the argument that Section 39(1)(d) of the Act makes seized articles government property and cannot be released. The High Court's decision is upheld and all appeals and special leave petitions are dismissed.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the power of Magistrates to release seized vehicles during the pendency of trial under the Wild Life Protection Act. The State of Madhya Pradesh had argued that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not apply to the Act, but the court rejected this argument and held that the Magistrate had the power to release a seized vehicle during the pendency of trial. The court's decision is also significant because it clarifies the effect of the deletion of sub-section (2) of Section 50, which means that a person must approach the Magistrate directly for interim release of a seized vehicle.

The court's decision is based on a careful examination of the relevant provisions of law and the previous decisions of the court. The court notes that the State's argument that Section 50 and other provisions in Chapter VI of the Act excluded the application of any provisions of the Code was untenable. The court also notes that the previous decision in Kunchindammed is not applicable to the present case, which arises under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court cites the case of Moti Lal vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. to support the view that Section 50 of the Wild Life Act does not exclude the operation of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court's decision is also significant because it rejects the argument that Section 39(1)(d) of the Act makes seized articles government property and cannot be released. The court notes that this argument is based on a misreading of the provision, which only applies to articles seized under Section 39(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. The court notes that Section 39(1)(d) does not apply to vehicles or vessels seized under Section 50(1)(c) of the Act.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India's recent court order clarifies the power of Magistrates to release seized vehicles during the pendency of trial under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court's decision is based on a careful examination of the relevant provisions of law and the previous decisions of the court. The court's decision is also significant because it clarifies the effect of the deletion of sub-section (2) of Section 50 and rejects the argument that Section 39(1)(d) of the Act makes seized articles government property and cannot be released. The court's decision is an important contribution to the development of the law in this area and will be of interest to practitioners and scholars alike.
