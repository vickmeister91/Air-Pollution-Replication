A petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking the production of original cheques and bank return memos before the VIII Metropolitan Magistrate in Chennai. The petitioner had given a loan of Rs.6 lakhs to N. Natarajan and his mother Jeyanthi, who had given three cheques in favour of the petitioner, each worth Rs.2 lakhs. However, when the petitioner deposited the cheques for encashment, they were returned dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The police had not filed the documents before the trial court, which were received from the petitioner during the course of investigation.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor handed over the original cheques to the learned counsel for the petitioner, who filed a memo indicating the cheque numbers, dates, amount, and the name of the bank. The Criminal Original Petition was disposed of with a direction to the learned VIII Metropolitan Magistrate to dispose of the case in C.C.No.103 of 2016, on merits and as per law, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
