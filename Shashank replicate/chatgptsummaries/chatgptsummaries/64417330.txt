The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Hansraj against the State of Rajasthan and other respondents regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and impose damages or compensation on persons found contaminating the water. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure compliance with the directions.

The court order requests the State and local authorities to provide an action taken report on the enforcement of compensation or damages.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and how it does not bar writ jurisdiction. The court emphasizes the importance of fundamental and constitutional rights and the discretion given to High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue prerogative writs, orders, and directions to ensure enforcement, extension, and protection of these rights. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances in which this principle can be deviated from. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner(s) to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT is expected to possess ample power to condone the delay and entertain the application/representation.
