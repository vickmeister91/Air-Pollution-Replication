The first court order pertains to the case of A. Krishna Patra vs Orissa State Electricity Board. The petitioner in this case is seeking compensation for the death of his wife who was electrocuted due to a live conductor that had snapped and was lying on the ground. The Orissa State Electricity Board denies liability, claiming that they were not aware of the snapped conductor on the public road.

The court finds that the O.S.E.B. is responsible for the incident due to lack of care and caution on their part, and that the principle of strict liability applies. The court notes that the generation and transmission of electricity is a hazardous activity, and therefore, the standard of care and caution required is high. The court rejects the plea of an inevitable accident or act of God, as the incident was solely due to the negligence of the O.S.E.B.

This ruling is significant as it establishes the principle of strict liability in cases involving hazardous activities such as the generation and transmission of electricity. The court's decision also highlights the importance of exercising care and caution in such activities to prevent harm to individuals.

The second court order discusses a case where the defense of "act of God" was successful in a lawsuit under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher. The court also discusses a public interest litigation case where the question was raised about the liability of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries in the event of accidents causing harm to individuals.

The court ruled that such industries owe an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure no harm results from their activities and are strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those affected by accidents. The court ordered compensation of Rs. 50,000 for the death of a woman who was electrocuted due to a live conductor snapping.

This ruling is significant as it establishes the principle of absolute and non-delegable duty of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries towards the community. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that such industries take all necessary precautions to prevent harm to individuals.

In conclusion, both court orders highlight the importance of exercising care and caution in hazardous activities and industries to prevent harm to individuals. The principle of strict liability and absolute and non-delegable duty established in these rulings serve as a reminder to industries and individuals alike to take necessary precautions to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of the community.
