In a recent court order, the first anticipatory bail application filed by Mahesh under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. was dismissed. Mahesh had filed the application as he was apprehending his arrest in relation to Crime No.325/2011 registered at Police Station-Forest Circle Officer Khalwa (Gen) District-Khandwa for the offence punishable under Section 26 of Indian Forest Act & Section 22 of Biological Diversity Act. However, the court found that it was not a fit case for granting anticipatory bail.

The case in question pertains to the violation of the Indian Forest Act and the Biological Diversity Act. These acts have been put in place to protect the environment and the wildlife in the country. The violation of these acts is a serious offence and can lead to severe consequences.

Mahesh, who had filed the anticipatory bail application, was apprehending his arrest in relation to the case. He had hoped that the court would grant him anticipatory bail, which would have allowed him to avoid arrest in case the police decided to take him into custody. However, the court found that the case was not fit for granting anticipatory bail.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the nature of the offence was serious, and the violation of the Indian Forest Act and the Biological Diversity Act is a grave offence. Secondly, the court found that there was a possibility that Mahesh may tamper with the evidence if he was granted anticipatory bail. This would have hindered the investigation and made it difficult for the police to gather evidence against him.

Additionally, the court also took into consideration the fact that Mahesh had not cooperated with the investigation so far. He had not provided any information or assistance to the police in their investigation. This lack of cooperation was seen as a negative factor by the court, and it further strengthened their decision to dismiss the anticipatory bail application.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the anticipatory bail application filed by Mahesh was based on several factors. The nature of the offence, the possibility of tampering with evidence, and the lack of cooperation by Mahesh were all taken into consideration by the court. The decision serves as a reminder that the violation of environmental laws is a serious offence and will not be taken lightly by the courts.
