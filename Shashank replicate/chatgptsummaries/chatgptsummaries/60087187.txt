The first court order pertains to a case where a workman filed an application under section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act claiming an amount of Rs. 2,80,200/- consisting of salary, overtime wages, and gratuity. The management contested the application, claiming that the workman had no existing right and had already taken full and final settlement. The court found that the workman was employed with the management from 20.3.81 till 30.6.88 and was entitled to be paid salary for six years on account of closure of the management. The court also cited the scope of Section 33(C)(2) of the Act and the need for earlier adjudication or recognition of entitlement by the employer for the claim to be within the scope of a proceeding under Sec. 33C(2) of the Act.

The second court order discusses a case where daily-rated/casual workers claimed to be paid wages at the same rate as regular workers.

The court found that the workman failed to prove any existing right in his favor arising out of an award, settlement, or service conditions. Therefore, the workman was not entitled to any amount claimed for.
