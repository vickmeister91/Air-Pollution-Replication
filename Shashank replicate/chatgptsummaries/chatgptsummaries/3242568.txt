The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Kallu Singh, who was seeking regular bail in a case that was pending before AMJM No.2 Dholpur. The case pertained to an offence under Sections 29/51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. It is worth noting that the petitioner had previously jumped bail, but was now in custody for the last month.

The court, after hearing the arguments put forth by both parties, allowed the petition and granted bail to the petitioner. However, the bail was granted subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the petitioner will have to fulfill certain conditions before he can be released on bail.

It is important to understand the significance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which is the law under which the petitioner was charged. This act was enacted with the aim of protecting wild animals and plants, and to ensure the ecological and environmental security of the country. The act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves, and also lays down strict penalties for those who violate its provisions.

In this case, the petitioner was charged under Sections 29/51 of the act, which deal with hunting in a sanctuary or national park without a permit, and with possessing or transporting any wild animal or plant without a valid license. These are serious offences, and the fact that the petitioner had previously jumped bail only adds to the gravity of the situation.

However, it is also important to note that bail is a fundamental right of every citizen, and can only be denied in exceptional circumstances. The court, in this case, appears to have taken into account the fact that the petitioner had been in custody for a month, and may have satisfied certain conditions that would make him eligible for bail.

It is also worth noting that the court has granted bail subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the petitioner will have to appear before the Trial Court and fulfill certain conditions before he can be released on bail. These conditions may include depositing a certain amount of money as security, surrendering his passport, or agreeing to certain restrictions on his movements.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a petition filed by Kallu Singh seeking regular bail in a case pending before AMJM No.2 Dholpur for an offence under Sections 29/51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has allowed the petition and granted bail to the petitioner subject to satisfaction of the Trial Court. While the charges against the petitioner are serious, it is important to remember that bail is a fundamental right, and can only be denied in exceptional circumstances. The court appears to have taken into account the circumstances of the case, and has granted bail subject to certain conditions that the petitioner will have to fulfill before he can be released.
