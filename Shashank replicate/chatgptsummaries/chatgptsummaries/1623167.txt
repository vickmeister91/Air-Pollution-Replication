The Indian judiciary has been active in resolving disputes related to industrial development in Delhi. Two recent court orders have addressed issues related to the possession of industrial plots and the closure of illegal industrial units in non-conforming areas.

The first court order pertains to a dispute between Super Electricals and Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC) over the refusal of DSIDC to hand over possession of industrial plots to Super Electricals, despite the latter having paid the entire sale consideration. The court notes that DSIDC's stand is based on a 1999 order that deviates from the 1996 policy aimed at improving living conditions in Delhi, which was itself an implementation of the orders of the Supreme Court in the M.C. Mehta case. The court reiterates that the law laid down in M.C. Mehta must be followed by the Respondents and that they do not possess the power to deviate from that law. The court also notes that the stand of the Respondents' tantamounts to contempt of the highest Court of India.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the rule of law and ensures that government agencies cannot deviate from established policies and laws. It also protects the rights of individuals and businesses who have paid for industrial plots and are entitled to possession.

The second court order pertains to the closure of industrial units that have been operating illegally in non-conforming areas in Delhi. The court has directed all such units that have come up after August 1, 1990, to close down within a specified time frame. The order also directs the Central Government to finalize the list of permissible household industries and allot industrial plots to 6,000 industrial units on the waiting list. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is directed to consider withdrawing exemption notifications, and a monitoring committee is appointed to oversee compliance with the court's directions.

The order also allows for the enforcement of concluded contracts for the grant of LPG dealership and directs the respondents to hand over possession of the allotted plots to the petitioners. The DSIDC is liable to pay interest at the rate of 5% per annum, which may increase to 7% per annum if possession is not delivered within thirty days.

This court order is significant as it addresses the issue of illegal industrial units operating in non-conforming areas, which can have a negative impact on the environment and public health. It also ensures that the government takes steps to regulate industrial development and provides a fair and transparent process for the allocation of industrial plots.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of the judiciary in ensuring that industrial development in Delhi is carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner. They also highlight the need for government agencies to follow established policies and laws and to protect the rights of individuals and businesses.
