The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Cuttack heard six appeals filed by National Aluminium Co. Ltd. against the orders of the CIT(A)-II, Bhubaneswar, relating to assessment years 1994-95 to 1998-99 and 2000-01. The appeals were disposed of in a consolidated order. The first ground of appeal was related to the disallowance of an amount of Rs. 4,86,70,639 on account of valuation of non-moving stores and spares. The AO disallowed the amount, holding that the loss can be considered as capital loss. The learned CIT(A) upheld the disallowance, stating that the loss does not necessarily relate to the previous year and the loss quantified is notional and ad hoc estimation. The tribunal found that the diminution of value because of obsolescence at 20% of historical cost cannot be said to be without any basis and that the change effected by the assessee is bona fide and aimed at obtaining correct business profit.

The court order discusses various cases where the method of valuation of stock was changed by the assessee, and the claim for deduction was allowed if the change was bona fide and followed regularly in subsequent years. The court also discusses the issue of prior period adjustments and directs the AO to delete the addition made on account of other manufacturing expenses, but restores the issue of administrative, selling, and distribution expenses back to the AO for further details. Grounds of appeal not pressed for hearing were dismissed, and the appeal was partly allowed.

The court order dismisses a general appeal and partially allows an appeal filed by the assessee for the assessment years 1994-95 and 1995-96. The court allows the claim of Rs. 40,47,757 on account of valuation of non-moving stores and spares and directs the AO to allow interest on electricity duty as a general business expenditure, as it is compensatory in nature and not a penalty. The court cites previous decisions to support its ruling.

The court order states that interest on electricity duty is compensatory in nature and should be allowed as a general business expenditure, and that Section 43B does not apply to such interest. The court also discusses a dispute over peripheral development expenses, with the appellant arguing that all expenses were incurred for business purposes and the respondent arguing that the conditions of Section 37(1) were not met. The court ultimately finds that some of the expenses have a business nexus and should be allowed, while others do not and should be disallowed. A detailed breakdown of the expenses is provided.

The court order discusses the appellant's expenses incurred on employees and displaced persons during the construction of a plant. Some expenses were incurred on the direction of authorities, while others were spent to earn goodwill and be a good corporate citizen. The court cites various cases to support the argument that such expenses can be considered business expenditure under Section 37 of the IT Act. The court allows the remaining amount of Rs. 38,26,000 as business expenditure and dismisses the other grounds of appeal.

The court order pertains to an appeal made by an assessee for the assessment year 1996-97. The order discusses various grounds of appeal, including the disallowance of a loss on account of valuation of non-moving stores and spares, the treatment of interest on electricity duty, the treatment of water charges payable to the government of Orissa, the disallowance of peripheral development expenses, and the disallowance of contribution to the Mineral Development Fund set up by the Government of India. The court found that some of the grounds of appeal were identical to those in previous cases and decided in favor of the assessee, while others were disallowed.

The court order pertains to two different grounds of appeal. The first ground relates to a payment made by the appellant to the Mineral Exploration Fund, which was established by the Ministry of Mines for promoting sustainable exploration and development activities in the field of minerals. The appellant had paid the amount as per the proven deposit of Bauxite on the basis of proven data. The court held that the payment was a statutory requirement and the expenditure had been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business, and thus allowed the appeal. The second ground relates to an expenditure of Rs. 11.19 lakhs claimed by the appellant on account of contribution towards a benevolent fund. The court held that the expenditure was in the nature of staff welfare expenses and allowable under Section 37(1) of the IT Act, and directed the AO to allow the expenditure as a deductible expenditure.

The court order directs the AO to allow certain expenditures as deductible, including those related to good business relations and advertising expenses. The court also allows appeals related to loss on unserviceable materials and liability for post-retirement medical benefits and leave encashment, citing previous court decisions and accounting standards. However, the court disallows a claim for present cost of future liabilities for post-retirement medical benefits. The court also notes that the liability for leave encashment benefits represents not only liability accrued during the previous year but also includes liability of earlier years.

The court order discusses various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in relation to the computation of book profit under Section 115JA of the IT Act. The court upholds the decision of the learned CIT(A) in most of the grounds, including the encashment benefits, valuation loss
