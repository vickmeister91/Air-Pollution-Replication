The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by Mr. Ram Dayal De, who sought to plead on behalf of the plaintiff respondents without submitting a Vakalatnama. The Bar Association supported Mr. De's argument that he could plead by submitting a memorandum of appearance under Order 3, Rule 4, Clause 5 of the Civil Procedure Code. However, the court ruled that a pleader cannot plead unless there has been an appearance by the party in person or by a pleader appointed to act for them.

The court order highlights the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations set forth by the court. The court notes that the rules of the appellate side of the High Court require a deposit of Rs. 7-8-0 by every respondent appearing, and since Mr. De's clients did not comply with this rule, the case would proceed as if they had not appeared.

The court's ruling is significant as it underscores the importance of following the proper procedures when appearing before a court. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to legal professionals that they must adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by the court, and that failure to do so can result in adverse consequences for their clients.

The court's decision is also noteworthy as it highlights the importance of ensuring that all parties involved in a legal proceeding are properly represented. The court's ruling makes it clear that a pleader cannot plead on behalf of a party unless that party has appeared in person or has appointed a pleader to act on their behalf.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations set forth by the court. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that all parties involved in a legal proceeding are properly represented. Legal professionals must take note of the court's ruling and ensure that they are following the proper procedures when appearing before a court.
