The court order in question relates to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petition seeks to quash a criminal proceeding against the petitioners in connection with an offence under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has issued an urgent notice to the Opposite Party No. 2 and has ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioners until the next date of hearing, which is scheduled for 10th December, 2014.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a comprehensive legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to protect and improve the quality of the environment and to prevent and control environmental pollution. Section 15 of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder. The section provides for imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.

The petitioners in this case have been accused of violating the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The nature of the alleged violation is not clear from the available information. However, it is evident that the petitioners are seeking to have the criminal proceeding against them quashed on the grounds that it is without merit.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The section provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, the petitioners have invoked the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to seek the quashing of the criminal proceeding against them. The court has issued an urgent notice to the Opposite Party No. 2, which is likely the prosecuting agency in the case, and has ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioners until the next date of hearing.

The order of the court is significant in that it provides temporary relief to the petitioners by preventing any coercive action against them until the next date of hearing. This is a common practice in cases where the court is of the view that the petitioners have made out a prima facie case for relief and that the matter requires further consideration.

It is important to note that the order of the court does not amount to a final decision on the merits of the case. The court has merely granted temporary relief to the petitioners and has directed that the matter be listed for further hearing on 10th December, 2014. At that hearing, the court will consider the arguments of both parties and will make a final decision on the merits of the case.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking the quashing of a criminal proceeding against the petitioners in connection with an offence under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has issued an urgent notice to the Opposite Party No. 2 and has ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioners until the next date of hearing, which is scheduled for 10th December, 2014. The order of the court provides temporary relief to the petitioners and does not amount to a final decision on the merits of the case.
