In the first court order, the petitioner filed a writ petition seeking compensation of Rs. 3 lakhs from the respondents for the death of his son due to electrocution caused by a snapped live wire maintained by the respondents. The respondents admitted liability but stated that compensation beyond Rs. 25,000 cannot be paid as it is an ex gratia payment. The court held that the respondents cannot deny just compensation when the liability has been admitted and that the petitioner is entitled to compensation considering the undisputed fact that the child was not responsible for the accident and the duty to maintain the line rests with the respondents.

The court also held that the respondents cannot escape liability by stating that the occurrence was an Act of God. The court cited previous judgments to support its decision and directed the respondents to pay the petitioner compensation. The court's decision was based on the principle of strict liability, which holds that a person or entity is responsible for any harm caused to another person or entity, regardless of whether or not they were negligent.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it reinforces the principle of strict liability and ensures that victims of accidents caused by the negligence of others are compensated fairly. The court's decision also highlights the importance of maintaining safety standards and ensuring that infrastructure is properly maintained to prevent accidents.

In the second court order, the court order in IEF Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu & Others vs. Mrs. R. Selvam states that it is the duty of hostel authorities to provide security arrangements for students, especially girls. The court also held that the power of judicial review under Article 226 for awarding compensation due to negligence on the part of public authorities is available.

The petitioner was awarded a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- as compensation with 7.5% interest from the date of the death of their son till the actual payment, to be paid by the respondents within eight weeks. The court referred to guidelines provided under the Motor Vehicles Act for fixing just compensation.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it reinforces the duty of public authorities to ensure the safety and security of citizens, especially vulnerable groups such as students. The court's decision also highlights the importance of judicial review in ensuring that public authorities are held accountable for their actions and that victims of negligence are compensated fairly.
