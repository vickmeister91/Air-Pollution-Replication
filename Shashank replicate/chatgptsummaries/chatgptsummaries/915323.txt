The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the discharge of the Vadalia Metal Corporation and its partners and manager in a case involving the discharge of trade effluent without treatment. The court found that the Board did not produce sufficient evidence to establish even a prima facie case against the accused, and therefore the discharge was not perverse. The court also noted that the Board did not comply with the provisions of the Act and failed to produce parameters or criteria for comparison.

The court order cites previous judgments by the Apex Court to establish that the appellate court can only interfere with an order of acquittal/discharge if there is a manifest illegality or error of law, or if the lower court has ignored material evidence on record. In this case, the court finds that there is no such illegality or error, and therefore confirms the discharge of the accused persons recorded by the lower court. The present appeal is dismissed.

The case in question involved the discharge of trade effluent without treatment by the Vadalia Metal Corporation and its partners and manager. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused, alleging that they had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The accused were subsequently charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 277 (fouling water of public spring or reservoir), Section 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), and Section 432 (mischief by causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees).

The lower court had discharged the accused, finding that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against them. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board subsequently filed an appeal against the discharge order, arguing that the lower court had erred in its findings.

The Gujarat High Court, however, found that the Board had not produced sufficient evidence to establish even a prima facie case against the accused. The court noted that the Board had failed to comply with the provisions of the Act and had not produced parameters or criteria for comparison. The court also cited previous judgments by the Apex Court to establish that the appellate court can only interfere with an order of acquittal/discharge if there is a manifest illegality or error of law, or if the lower court has ignored material evidence on record. In this case, the court found that there was no such illegality or error, and therefore confirmed the discharge of the accused persons recorded by the lower court.

The court's decision highlights the importance of producing sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against the accused. It also underscores the need for compliance with the provisions of the Act and the production of parameters or criteria for comparison. The court's reliance on previous judgments by the Apex Court also serves as a reminder of the limited scope of the appellate court's powers in cases of acquittal/discharge.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a cautionary tale for prosecutors and regulatory bodies, emphasizing the importance of producing sufficient evidence and complying with the provisions of the Act. It also underscores the need for appellate courts to exercise caution when considering appeals against orders of acquittal/discharge, and to limit their interference to cases of manifest illegality or error of law.
