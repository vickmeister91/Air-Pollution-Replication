The Supreme Court of India recently issued a court order in response to a petition seeking a writ of certiorari to quash an order rejecting an application for a saw-mill license. The State Government had established rules for the establishment and regulation of saw-mills, but the Supreme Court had given directions in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India, which required prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. 

The Court clarified that the license for a saw-mill shall not be granted in a forest area, and the second proviso to Rule 5 provided that an application for a license for a saw-mill situated within 10 km of any existing forest shall not be deemed to have been allowed if not disposed of within 60 days. The petitioner had deposited the fee for the license, but this did not amount to renewal of the license. The petitioner could have filed a fresh application for a license, but the rejection of the previous application did not consider the factors mentioned above.

The court order stated that a license for a sawmill cannot be granted in a forest area, and an application for a license for a sawmill within 10 km of an existing forest cannot be granted unless disposed of within 60 days. The state government is responsible for defining forest areas and areas where sawmill licenses can be granted. The court found that the rejection of the petitioner's application did not consider these factors and ordered a new decision to be made within two months. 

The court also directed the state government to consider amending rules in light of the court's decision. This is an important step towards ensuring that the establishment and regulation of saw-mills is done in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and in line with the principles of forest conservation.

The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the importance of protecting forests and the environment. The establishment and operation of saw-mills can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is important to ensure that these activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner. The court's decision also highlights the need for clear rules and regulations governing the establishment and operation of saw-mills, and the importance of ensuring that these rules are enforced.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards ensuring that the establishment and operation of saw-mills is done in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and in line with the principles of forest conservation. It is important for the state government to take the court's decision seriously and to work towards amending rules and regulations in a manner that is consistent with the court's decision. This will help to ensure that the environment is protected and that the establishment and operation of saw-mills is done in a responsible and sustainable manner.
