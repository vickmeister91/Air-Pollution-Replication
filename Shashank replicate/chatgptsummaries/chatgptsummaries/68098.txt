The Gujarat High Court recently allowed an application filed under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for condoning the delay of 8 days caused in preferring Revision Application No.290 of 1995 against the order of Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, in Criminal Case No.701 of 1990 for offences punishable under section 39 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act. The delay of 8 days caused in preferring the Revision Application was condoned.

The case in question pertains to offences punishable under section 39 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act. The Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, had passed an order in Criminal Case No.701 of 1990, which was challenged by way of Revision Application No.290 of 1995. However, the Revision Application was filed with a delay of 8 days.

The applicant sought condonation of the delay on the ground that the delay was caused due to the illness of the counsel who was to file the Revision Application. The applicant submitted that the counsel had fallen ill and was unable to file the Revision Application within the prescribed time limit. The applicant further submitted that the delay was not intentional and that there was no negligence on the part of the applicant.

The Gujarat High Court considered the submissions made by the applicant and observed that the delay of 8 days was not a very long delay. The Court further observed that the applicant had provided sufficient reasons for the delay and that there was no negligence on the part of the applicant. The Court also noted that the delay had not caused any prejudice to the other party.

In light of the above, the Gujarat High Court allowed the application filed under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for condoning the delay of 8 days caused in preferring Revision Application No.290 of 1995 against the order of Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, in Criminal Case No.701 of 1990 for offences punishable under section 39 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act. The delay of 8 days caused in preferring the Revision Application was condoned.

This decision of the Gujarat High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of providing sufficient reasons for delay in filing an application. The Court has also emphasized that a delay of a few days may be condoned if there are valid reasons for the delay and if the delay has not caused any prejudice to the other party. This decision is likely to have a positive impact on litigants who may face genuine difficulties in filing applications within the prescribed time limit.
