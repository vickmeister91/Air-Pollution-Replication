The court order pertains to a petition filed by Colonel Subhash Chander Kohar (Retd) under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the order dated 29.10.2018 passed by Addl. Sessions Judge, SAS Nagar, Mohali, dismissing the petitioner's revision petition against the order of framing of charges dated 30.08.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Derabassi. The FIR in question was registered on the basis of a statement given by the complainant (Respondent No.2) T.K.Behara, IFS wherein it is alleged that an attempt has been made by the accused to take illegal possession of the Government land in front of Chhatbir Zoo.

The court found that the trial court had not taken into account the challan dated 23.04.2013 and the cancellation report dated 21.05.2015 filed under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. before forming an opinion that the trial is required. The court also cited the principles that emerge from the scope of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code.

The court order states that at the stage of Sections 227 and 228, the court must evaluate the material and documents on record to determine if the facts disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The court should sift the evidence and not accept everything the prosecution states as truth. If two views are possible and one gives rise to suspicion only, the trial judge can discharge the accused.

The order sets aside previous orders and remands the case back to the Magistrate to pass a speaking order after considering all the material.
