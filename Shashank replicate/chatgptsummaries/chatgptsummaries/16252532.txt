The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bhuvneshwar under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Bhuvneshwar has been in custody since 09.02.2018 in connection with a case registered under Sections 9 and 39 read with Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that some hairs of a bear and two pairs of its nails were seized from Bhuvneshwar's possession.

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court allowed Bhuvneshwar's bail application and directed him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or the trial court for his appearance before it on the dates given by the concerned court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, poaching, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 deals with the possession of any wild animal, animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy. Section 51 of the Act provides for the punishment for contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder.

In Bhuvneshwar's case, the prosecution alleges that he was in possession of some hairs of a bear and two pairs of its nails, which are considered animal articles under the Act. The possession of such articles is prohibited under Section 39 of the Act, and Bhuvneshwar has been charged with contravening this provision.

Bhuvneshwar filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the pendency of his trial. The grant of bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the furnishing of a bail bond and the provision of a solvent surety.

The court, after hearing arguments from both parties, allowed Bhuvneshwar's bail application and directed him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or the trial court for his appearance before it on the dates given by the concerned court.

The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and the court has to consider various factors before granting bail. The court has to consider the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, and the likelihood of the accused tampering with the evidence.

In Bhuvneshwar's case, the court considered the nature and gravity of the offence and the fact that he was in possession of animal articles that are prohibited under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court also considered the fact that Bhuvneshwar has been in custody for a considerable period and that he has no previous criminal antecedents.

The court also considered the fact that Bhuvneshwar has cooperated with the investigation and has not tampered with the evidence. The court, therefore, granted him bail subject to the conditions mentioned above.

In conclusion, the court order in Bhuvneshwar's case pertains to a bail application filed by him under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Bhuvneshwar has been in custody since 09.02.2018 in connection with a case registered under Sections 9 and 39 read with Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court, after hearing arguments from both parties, allowed Bhuvneshwar's bail application and directed him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or the trial court for his appearance before it on the dates given by the concerned court. The court considered various factors before granting bail, such as the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, and the likelihood of the accused tampering with the evidence.
