The Karnataka Lokayukta police had filed a case against M.V. Rajan Nambiar for offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Nambiar filed a criminal petition seeking anticipatory bail in the case. The court heard the petition and granted bail subject to certain conditions.

The court allowed Nambiar's petition for anticipatory bail, which means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with the case. However, the bail was granted subject to certain conditions. Nambiar was required to execute a personal bond and surrender before the investigating officer within 20 days. The court also warned that if Nambiar violates any of the conditions, the prosecution can seek cancellation of bail.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Nambiar is significant because it means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with the case. This is a relief for Nambiar, who would have faced arrest and detention if the court had not granted him anticipatory bail.

The court's decision to grant bail subject to certain conditions is also significant. The conditions imposed by the court are designed to ensure that Nambiar cooperates with the investigation and does not flee from justice. By requiring Nambiar to execute a personal bond and surrender before the investigating officer, the court is ensuring that he remains available for questioning and does not abscond.

The court's warning that the prosecution can seek cancellation of bail if Nambiar violates any of the conditions is also significant. This warning serves as a reminder to Nambiar that he must comply with the conditions imposed by the court. If he fails to do so, he risks having his bail cancelled and being arrested by the police.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to M.V. Rajan Nambiar in the case filed against him by the Karnataka Lokayukta police for offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act is significant. The bail was granted subject to certain conditions, including executing a personal bond and surrendering before the investigating officer within 20 days. The court's warning that the prosecution can seek cancellation of bail if Nambiar violates any of the conditions serves as a reminder to him that he must comply with the conditions imposed by the court.
