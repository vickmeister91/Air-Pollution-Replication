The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Kishore Dua, claiming that pollution is being caused in River Narmada in the District of Dindori by permitting the flow of 11 'Nalas' (drains) situated in the District to merge with the River. The petitioner sought relief in the form of a direction to the respondents to take appropriate action for preventing the merging of contaminated or polluted water of the 11 'Nalas' into River Narmada and to implement the Sanitation Plan of the Urban Administration Department for preventing pollution of the River in question.

However, the court found that the jurisdiction to deal with the matter rests exclusively with the National Green Tribunal, constituted under the Act of 2010, and it is not appropriate for this Court to usurp jurisdiction and deal with the matter. The petitioner was granted liberty to take recourse to the remedy of approaching the Tribunal by raising an appropriate dispute as contemplated under section 14 of the Act of 2010.

The court order highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal in dealing with environmental disputes. The Tribunal was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, to provide effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Tribunal has the power to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues and has jurisdiction over all matters relating to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment.

The court order also emphasizes the need for effective implementation of the Sanitation Plan of the Urban Administration Department to prevent pollution of the River Narmada. The Sanitation Plan is a comprehensive plan for the management of solid waste, sewage, and other forms of waste generated in urban areas. The plan aims to ensure the safe disposal of waste and prevent pollution of water bodies.

The court's decision to direct the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal is in line with the principle of environmental justice. Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, in the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. The National Green Tribunal provides a platform for citizens to raise their concerns regarding environmental issues and seek redressal.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal in dealing with environmental disputes and emphasizes the need for effective implementation of the Sanitation Plan of the Urban Administration Department to prevent pollution of the River Narmada. The order also upholds the principle of environmental justice by directing the petitioner to approach the Tribunal for redressal of their grievances.
