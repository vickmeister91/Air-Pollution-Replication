The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case filed by Sri Guruprasad against the Government of India and others regarding the closure of his stone crushing unit. The petitioner's lawyer argued that there is no bar for entertaining the writ petitions, but when the legislature has provided an appeal remedy on the facts and the law, the court is slow in exercising its discretion in entertaining the writ petitions. The court accepted this submission and disposed of the writ petitions, granting liberty to the writ petitioner to approach the appellate tribunal in accordance with the law. The court made no order as to costs and expressed no opinion on the merits.

The case concerned the closure of Sri Guruprasad's stone crushing unit, which had been shut down by the authorities due to alleged violations of environmental regulations. Sri Guruprasad had filed writ petitions challenging the closure, arguing that the authorities had acted arbitrarily and without following due process. He had sought relief from the court, asking for the closure order to be set aside and for permission to resume operations.

The court's decision to dispose of the writ petitions and grant liberty to the writ petitioner to approach the appellate tribunal in accordance with the law reflects a cautious approach to judicial intervention in matters where the legislature has provided an appeal remedy. The court recognized that while it has the power to entertain writ petitions, it should exercise its discretion carefully and not interfere with the appeal process provided by the legislature unless there are compelling reasons to do so.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following due process and complying with environmental regulations. Sri Guruprasad's stone crushing unit was shut down due to alleged violations of these regulations, and the court did not express any opinion on the merits of his case. This suggests that the court is committed to upholding environmental standards and ensuring that businesses comply with regulations designed to protect the environment.

Overall, the Karnataka High Court's decision in this case reflects a cautious approach to judicial intervention in matters where the legislature has provided an appeal remedy. The court recognized the importance of following due process and complying with environmental regulations, and granted liberty to the writ petitioner to approach the appellate tribunal in accordance with the law. While the court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case, its decision sends a clear message that businesses must comply with environmental regulations and that the court will not interfere with the appeal process provided by the legislature unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
