In a series of court orders, the issue of mining of sand and minor minerals in the state of Rajasthan was addressed. The first order was in response to a writ petition filed by a petitioner against the respondents for allowing mining of sand without scientific replenishment study, granting short term permits under Rule 51 of the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2017, and granting mining lease on agricultural land. The petitioner challenged the grant of short term permits without a scientific replenishment study being conducted and without an environmental clearance certificate being granted. The petitioner prayed that the respondents should be prohibited from permitting mining activity of bajri without scientific replenishment study, be it for a short term permit on private agricultural lands.

The court order that followed prohibited mining of bajri without scientific replenishment study, including short term permits on private agricultural lands. The order was passed after a writ petition was filed, and applicants were permitted to intervene but not impleaded as respondents. The court considered three contentions: the process of environmental clearance, scientific replenishment study, and short term permits. The court referred to legislative provisions and a Supreme Court decision in Deepak Kumar & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Ors. and noted the necessity for proper environmental assessment plans in cases of extraction of bajri within or near a river bed in blocks of less than 5 hectares separated by 1 km.

The third court order discussed the Supreme Court's opinion on the extraction of bajri within or near a river bed, highlighting the need for proper environmental assessment plans and the requirement for environmental clearances for mining leases of less than 5 hectares. The court also noted the amendment of the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1986, which limits the area of mineral concessions for mining leases/quarry licences/short term permits to only 1 sq. km. The court rejected the argument that lack of replenishment studies being conducted is a concern for mining on private agricultural land and government land, and discussed the District Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and its qualifications for experts. The court order was not concerned with mining of bajri in river beds, but rather with mining of bajri on private agricultural land and two instances of mining of bajri on government land.

The fourth court order outlined the qualifications and requirements for expert members in fields related to mining, geology, hydrology, environment, and ecology. The maximum age for members is 70, but can be extended to 75 in certain circumstances. Members must have at least 5 years of relevant experience and hold an advanced degree or equivalent experience. The maximum tenure for expert members is two terms of three years each, and they cannot be removed without cause and proper enquiry. The order also included an application form for mining of minor minerals and a procedure for preparing a district survey report.

The fifth court order outlined the procedure for obtaining environmental clearance for mining of minor minerals, including cluster situations. A Sub-Divisional Committee will visit each site for which environmental clearance has been applied for and make recommendations on the suitability of the site for mining or prohibition thereof. The mineral potential is calculated based on field investigation and geology of the catchment area of the river or streams. The District Survey Report shall be prepared for each minor mineral in the district separately, and its draft shall be placed in the public domain. The policy for environmental clearance for mining of minor minerals in cluster situations is also outlined. The SEIAAs shall have supervisory jurisdiction over the DEIAAs, and decisions of DEIAA shall be reviewed by the SEIAA without prejudice to any provisions under any existing law.

The final court order discussed the legality of mining for bajri and boulders in the State of Rajasthan. The court found that the legal provisions for mining on private khatedari lands and government lands away from riverbeds conform to sustainable development principles and take care of the environment. The court also noted that environmental clearances have been granted for mining in various districts of Rajasthan. The court rejected the petitioner's contention that environmental clearances were not granted as per law. The court highlighted that short term permits were granted for government projects of great public importance and that a balance must be struck between development and environmental concerns. The court also noted that necessary permission has been granted for the sale of by-products of mining.

In conclusion, the court orders addressed various aspects of mining of sand and minor minerals in the state of Rajasthan, including the need for scientific replenishment study, environmental clearance, and proper assessment plans. The court also outlined the qualifications and requirements for expert members and the procedure for obtaining environmental clearance for mining of minor minerals. The court emphasized the importance of sustainable development and balancing development with environmental concerns.
