The court order in question pertains to a bail application submitted by a man named Ajesh, who has been accused of trespassing into a reserve forest and shooting a wild elephant, taking its ivory and making sculptures out of it. The prosecution has not yet filed a complaint against Ajesh, who has been under judicial custody since March 2019.

The court has ordered that Ajesh is entitled to statutory default bail in accordance with Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code states that if an accused person has been in custody for a certain period of time without a charge sheet being filed, they are entitled to be released on bail. In this case, Ajesh has been in custody for more than 90 days without a charge sheet being filed, so he is entitled to default bail.

The court has directed Ajesh to file a formal application for default bail before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kothamangalam. This means that Ajesh will need to formally request his release on bail and provide any necessary documentation or evidence to support his request. The Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II will then review his application and make a decision on whether or not to grant him bail.

It is important to note that the court order does not mean that Ajesh has been acquitted of the charges against him. It simply means that he is entitled to default bail under the law. If the prosecution does file a complaint against him in the future, he may still face trial and potential conviction.

The charges against Ajesh are serious and involve the illegal killing of a wild elephant and the illegal trade of ivory. These actions are illegal under Indian law and carry significant penalties. It is important that the legal process is followed and that justice is served in this case.

Overall, the court order in question grants Ajesh the right to default bail under the law. He will need to file a formal application for bail and await a decision from the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II. It is important that the legal process is followed and that justice is served in this case.
