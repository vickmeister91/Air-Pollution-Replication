The case of T.G. Ruthramani vs. the respondents revolves around the construction of a garbage dumping yard in an open space reservation area that was gifted to the fourth respondent by the petitioner's association in 1992. The petitioner filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus to prevent the respondents from constructing the garbage dumping yard, arguing that the area was earmarked for public purposes, including a park, and had been used as such for several years. The fourth respondent claimed that the micro composting facility they were constructing would occupy only a small portion of the park and that the waste would be processed with proper scientific technology and disposed of without any dumping or accumulation.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment. In its order, the court noted that the construction work for a Micro Compost Yard had already been completed and only the establishment of attendant structures was pending. The court referred to previous judgments that emphasized the importance of public parks and open spaces for the welfare of the community. The court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner to restrain the respondents from putting up any construction or structure for the garbage dumping yard in the Open Space Reservation area.

The court held that the interest and welfare of the society is paramount and if the micro compost yard is not maintained properly, appropriate departmental action shall be initiated against the officials in charge. The court's decision was based on the fact that the micro composting facility would occupy only a small portion of the park and that the waste would be processed with proper scientific technology and disposed of without any dumping or accumulation. The court also noted that the area had been gifted to the fourth respondent by the petitioner's association in 1992, and that the petitioner had not raised any objections at that time.

The court's decision highlights the importance of public parks and open spaces for the welfare of the community. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for proper maintenance of the micro compost yard to ensure that it does not become a source of pollution or harm to the environment. The court's decision is a reminder that the interest and welfare of the society should always be paramount, and that any construction or development should be carried out with due regard to the environment and the community.
