The establishment of an international airport in the prohibited catchment area of Himayatsagar situated in Ranga Reddy District was challenged by The Forum for Better Hyderabad through a writ petition seeking a Writ of Mandamus declaring the action of the respondents as unconstitutional and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as well as the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and contrary to G.O.Ms.No. 111 M.A dated 8-3-1996 as well as the judgment of the Supreme Court in A.P. Pollution Control Board II v. M. V. Naidu, (2002) 2 SCC 62. The court heard the arguments of both parties and noted that the process of selecting a suitable site for the airport had been going on for several years and that various steps had been taken. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

In another court order, the establishment of an international airport at Shamshabad and the environmental impact assessment conducted before granting consent for the project was discussed. The court found that the project was cleared after considering several aspects elaborately by expert bodies at different levels and in accordance with the procedure specified in the Environment Impact Assessment Notification. However, there was a specific prohibition under G.O.Ms.No. 111 M.A. dated 8-3-1996 which exclusively deals with Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes. The court found that the airport is not a "polluting industry" which is totally prohibited under G.O.Ms.No. 111 dated 8-3-1996.

The third court order pertains to a case of environmental pollution and the establishment of an airport within 10 kilometers of two reservoirs. The court observed that the industry must prove that there would be no danger of pollution to the reservoirs. In this case, the A.P. Pollution Control Board granted consent for the establishment of the airport after considering expert opinions and reports. The court found that the activities of the airport were not comparable to those of a hazardous industry and that the pollution potential was negligible. The court also noted that the authorities had taken necessary precautions to prevent pollution and had issued specific conditions for compliance. The court dismissed the writ petition and did not find any merit in the objections raised by the petitioner.
