In the first court order, HDFC Bank had challenged notices issued to them under Section 91 Cr.P.C. during an investigation into FIR No.43/2011. The bank was directed to auction goods pledged with them, which were perishable commodities. The goods were auctioned and the amount was collected in the loan accounts of the debtors. The bank then moved an application to modify the order, stating that the FDRs be adjusted in the loan accounts of the debtors. The court allowed the bank to appropriate the amount obtained from the auction against the outstanding dues of the debtors. 

However, the investigation concluded that the goods pledged with the bank were not the subject matter of FIR No.43/2011. The bank filed an application to withdraw the undertaking submitted earlier. The application was opposed by the respondents, who were ordered to pay costs for their frivolous opposition. The writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn.

In the second court order, the petitioner's counsel requested to withdraw the writ petition, rendering it unnecessary. The court granted the request and dismissed the petition, as well as the stay application. All corrections were incorporated into the emailed judgment/order.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper legal procedures and ensuring that all actions taken are in line with the law. HDFC Bank's initial challenge to the notices issued under Section 91 Cr.P.C. ultimately led to a modification of the order, but the investigation revealed that the goods pledged with the bank were not relevant to the case. The bank was able to withdraw its undertaking, but the respondents were ordered to pay costs for their opposition. In the second court order, the petitioner's counsel was able to withdraw the writ petition, indicating that the matter had been resolved. 

These court orders serve as a reminder that legal proceedings can be complex and require careful attention to detail. It is important to work with experienced legal professionals who can guide individuals and organizations through the process and ensure that their rights are protected. By following proper legal procedures and working with knowledgeable attorneys, individuals and organizations can navigate the legal system with confidence and achieve the best possible outcomes.
