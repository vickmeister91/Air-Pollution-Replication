The court order in question relates to a case where a vehicle was seized for illegally transporting sand from a forest range. The owner of the vehicle filed a petition for the release of the vehicle on "supradnama" until the case is decided or the confiscation proceeding is disposed of. The court allowed the release of the vehicle subject to certain conditions.

Firstly, the court directed the applicant to furnish a bank guarantee of a certain amount as a security deposit. This was to ensure that the vehicle would be returned to the court if the owner was found guilty of the charges against them. Additionally, the applicant was required to provide an undertaking that they would not transfer ownership of the vehicle or allow it to be used for any anti-social activities.

The court also made it clear that the vehicle must be kept present for confiscation in the event of an order by the competent court. This means that if the court finds the owner guilty of the charges against them, the vehicle will be confiscated and returned to the court. The owner must ensure that the vehicle is available for confiscation at all times.

It is important to note that the court's decision to release the vehicle on "supradnama" does not mean that the charges against the owner have been dropped. The case will still proceed, and the owner will have to face the charges against them in court. However, the release of the vehicle will allow the owner to continue using it until the case is decided or the confiscation proceeding is disposed of.

In conclusion, the court order in this case allows for the release of a vehicle that was seized for illegally transporting sand from a forest range. The release is subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee and an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used for anti-social activities. The owner must also ensure that the vehicle is available for confiscation in the event of an order by the competent court. It is important to note that the release of the vehicle does not mean that the charges against the owner have been dropped, and the case will still proceed in court.
