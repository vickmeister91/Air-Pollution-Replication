The court order discussed in this summary pertains to the negative impact of shrimp farming on the environment and local communities in various regions of India. The court directed the respective state governments not to permit the setting up of any industry or construction within 500 meters from the sea water at the maximum high tide. The court also directed NEERI to investigate and submit a report on the establishment of prawn farms on rural cultivable lands and the environmental impact of shrimp culture. The court order highlights the emerging problem of coastal pollution in India and the need for action to control marine pollution and protect coastal environments.

The report discusses the traditional and modern methods of aquaculture and the importance of protecting ecologically sensitive areas. The court order outlines guidelines for sustainable shrimp aquaculture in India, emphasizing the importance of environmental protection, social equity, and economic development. The report recommends the development of new definitions and parameters for culture systems suited to Indian conditions, diversification of species, careful coastal zone management, and consideration of local needs to avoid conflicts. The report also calls for the development of regulations on the use of drugs and chemicals, effluent discharge standards, and viable technologies for secondary aquaculture.

The court order prohibits the setting up of new industries and expansion of existing industries, including fish processing units, within the Coastal Regulations Zone. The order also emphasizes the need for enforcement of legal provisions and regulations to prevent harmful changes to the environment and maintain water quality. The court order states that shrimp farming has no direct or indirect need for foreshore facilities and is not directly related to the waterfront. The setting up of shrimp farms on the sea coast and construction of ponds and infrastructure is hazardous and degrades the marine ecology, coastal environment, and aesthetic uses of the sea coast.

The court order discusses the negative impact of aquaculture farming on the environment and socio-economic status of coastal areas in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The report highlights issues such as contamination of surface water, soil, and groundwater, destruction of mangrove vegetation, loss of fish catch, and damage to fishing nets. The report also states that the damage caused by aquaculture farming is higher than the earnings from the sale of coastal aquaculture produce. The court order emphasizes the need for proper management practices and infrastructure facilities for the affected population.

The court order describes the destruction of mangrove vegetation for the development of shrimp farms in various locations in South Arcot district and Kuchipalam village. The report concludes that the cost of ecological and social damage from aquaculture far exceeds the benefits, and that current practices violate fundamental rights and livelihoods of people. The report recommends socio-economic assessments, mandatory guidelines for aquaculture management, and the creation of an eco-restoration fund. The NEERI report also highlights violations of CRZ regulations and organic pollution in creeks and estuaries in various states.

The court order discusses the NEERI report on the impact of aquaculture farming on ecologically fragile coastal areas in India. The report highlights various violations of CRZ regulations, including the conversion of agricultural land and traditional fish farms into shrimp farms, destruction of mangrove vegetation, and organic pollution in rivers, creeks, and estuaries. The report also notes the intrusion of salinity in drinking water sources and the accumulation of organic carbon and heavy metals in the sediments of shrimp farms. The report recommends a detailed EIA before finalizing the development of shrimp farms in certain areas and dropping World Bank-aided projects in national park areas.

The court order pertains to the negative impact of shrimp farming on the environment in various regions of India. The Chilka Lagoon has been affected by siltation and shrimp farming activities, and the court has ordered the removal of deposited silt and closure of shrimp farms to restore the lagoon's ecological condition. The Subarnarekha Mouth has also been affected by shrimp farming, resulting in waterlogging and depletion of groundwater resources. The court has ordered the closure of new hatcheries and the installation of wastewater and sediment treatment systems. The west coast has also been affected by shrimp farming, resulting in the conversion of agricultural land and loss of mangrove ecosystems. The court has ordered the stopping of the indiscriminate destruction of mangrove ecosystems and the installation of proper peripheral drainage and wastewater treatment systems.

The court order discusses the negative impact of shrimp farming on coastal areas, particularly in West Bengal and Orissa. It recommends that aquaculture farms should be established on modified extensive mode and that semi-intensive and intensive modes should be avoided. The court also suggests that wastewater treatment facilities should be installed to minimize water exchange and sediments should be treated and converted into manure for land application. The court also recommends that agricultural lands should not be converted for aquaculture and that wild seed collection from creek, estuary, and sea should be prohibited. Additionally, an eco-restoration fund should be created to collect fees from aquaculture farm owners and used for rejuvenation of coastal eco-systems.

The court order addresses the negative impact of commercial shrimp farming on the environment and livelihoods of people in coastal areas. It calls for a critical review of the Jagatjaore-Sanaspada project and abandonment of commercial shrimp farms in Chilka Lagoon. The order also highlights violations of MEF's norms for location of aquaculture farms and hatcheries on the west coast of India. The court mandates the formulation and adoption of legislative Acts for proper management
