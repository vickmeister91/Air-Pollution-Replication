The court observed that the leasehold rights of the petitioner had expired and that the petitioner had not applied for renewal of the lease.

The appeal had been filed by the HSIDC against the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had directed the HSIDC to transfer the ownership of the land to the industrial units on payment of a certain amount.

In light of these facts, the court disposed of the petition and gave the petitioner liberty to file a fresh application for the certificate. The court directed the petitioner to comply with all the statutory requirements and to submit all the relevant documents and information.
