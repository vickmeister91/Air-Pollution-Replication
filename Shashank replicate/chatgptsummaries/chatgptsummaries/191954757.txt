In the first court order, the Commissioner of Central Excise Coimbatore filed an appeal under Section 35-G of the Central Excise Act against the order dated 26.3.07 passed by the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench, Chennai, made in Final Order No.409/2007. The case pertains to the refund of a deposit made under protest during an investigation. The Department appealed against the Tribunal's decision to allow the refund without considering the principle of unjust enrichment and without issuing a show cause notice under Section 11-A of the Act. 

The High Court held that the deposit made under protest is not subject to the principle of unjust enrichment and that the issuance of a show cause notice under Section 11-A is mandatory for recovery. The Court distinguished the case from Asian Paints (India) Ltd. - Vs  Commissioner of Central Excise (2002 (142) ELT 522 (SC)) and upheld the Tribunal's decision. The court order clarifies that the principle of unjust enrichment does not apply to deposits made under protest. This means that if a deposit is made under protest, the Department cannot claim that the person who made the deposit has been unjustly enriched. 

The court also held that the issuance of a show cause notice under Section 11-A is mandatory for recovery. Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act deals with the recovery of duties not levied or paid, or short-levied or short-paid, or erroneously refunded. The court order clarifies that before passing an order for recovery of duty, a show cause notice must be issued. The court notes that the period for issuance of the notice was six months prior to May 12, 2000, and one year thereafter. 

In the second court order, the case pertains to the recovery of duties not levied or paid, or short-levied or short-paid, or erroneously refunded under Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act. The court states that a show cause notice must be issued before passing an order for recovery of duty, and that the notice is mandatory. The court also notes that the period for issuance of the notice was six months prior to May 12, 2000, and one year thereafter. 

The court finds that no such notice was issued in this case, and therefore, the Department cannot seek recovery of the amount. The appeal is dismissed, and there is no order as to costs. This court order reinforces the importance of issuing a show cause notice before passing an order for recovery of duty. It also clarifies that if no notice is issued within the prescribed period, the Department cannot seek recovery of the amount. 

In summary, both court orders deal with the recovery of duties under Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act. The first court order clarifies that the principle of unjust enrichment does not apply to deposits made under protest, and that a show cause notice is mandatory for recovery. The second court order reinforces the importance of issuing a show cause notice before passing an order for recovery of duty, and clarifies that if no notice is issued within the prescribed period, the Department cannot seek recovery of the amount. These court orders provide important guidance for the recovery of duties under the Central Excise Act.
