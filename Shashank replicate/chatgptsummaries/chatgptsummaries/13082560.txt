The court recently granted bail to Fajeed Rao Jambholkar, who had filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Jambholkar had been arrested in connection with a case registered under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application, taking into account the fact that Jambholkar had no criminal antecedents and was not required to be kept in custody during the trial.

The court ordered Jambholkar to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety and comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. This section lays down the conditions for granting bail in non-bailable offences. The conditions include that the accused shall not leave the country without the permission of the court, shall attend all court proceedings, shall not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses, and shall not commit any offence while on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Jambholkar was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that Jambholkar had no criminal antecedents, which meant that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. Secondly, the court observed that Jambholkar was not required to be kept in custody during the trial, as he was not a flight risk and there was no danger of him committing any offence while on bail. Finally, the court took into account the fact that Jambholkar had cooperated with the investigation and had not obstructed the course of justice in any way.

The Wild Life Protection Act, under which Jambholkar was charged, is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves, and lays down strict penalties for offences such as hunting, poaching, and trafficking of wildlife. The Act also provides for the protection of endangered species and their habitats, and lays down guidelines for the management of wildlife resources.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Jambholkar was based on several factors, including his lack of criminal antecedents, his cooperation with the investigation, and the fact that he was not a flight risk or likely to tamper with evidence. The court's order also highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act in protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the need for strict enforcement of the Act to deter offences such as hunting, poaching, and trafficking of wildlife.
