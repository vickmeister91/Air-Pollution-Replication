The second court order discusses the potential health and environmental risks associated with the erection of a cell phone tower in a particular area. The court had previously issued guidelines for the installation of such towers, but the petitioner argues that the tower in question would cause harm to nearby residents. The government advocate takes notice of the petition, and the court reviews the previous guidelines. The court ultimately decides to issue a stay on the erection of the tower until further investigation can be conducted.
