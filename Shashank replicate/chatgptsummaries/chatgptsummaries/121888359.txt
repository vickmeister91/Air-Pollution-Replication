Ajabul Sekh, who was accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act by possessing flesh from a dolphin that was killed in the Ganga River, has been granted bail by the court. The petitioner's counsel argued that Sekh only procured the flesh and did not kill the dolphin. The court ordered the petitioner to be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties, with the condition that he deposit Rs. 10,000 in the Kerala Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund and provide a receipt of the deposit at the time of furnishing his bail bonds.

The case of Ajabul Sekh is an interesting one, as it raises questions about the protection of wildlife and the role of individuals in preserving it. The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to protect endangered species and their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, and also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any part of a wild animal's body. The Act also provides for penalties and imprisonment for those who violate its provisions.

In the case of Ajabul Sekh, the petitioner's counsel argued that Sekh only procured the flesh of the dolphin and did not kill it. This raises questions about the extent of an individual's responsibility in cases of wildlife protection. While it is clear that killing or capturing a wild animal is a violation of the Act, it is less clear whether possessing a part of a wild animal's body is also a violation. The court's decision to grant bail to Sekh suggests that there may be some ambiguity in this regard.

However, the court's decision also imposes certain conditions on Sekh's release on bail. The requirement that he deposit Rs. 10,000 in the Kerala Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund and provide a receipt of the deposit at the time of furnishing his bail bonds is an interesting one. This condition suggests that the court is not only concerned with punishing Sekh for his alleged violation of the Act, but also with ensuring that he contributes to the welfare of society in some way.

The Kerala Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund is a fund that is used to provide financial assistance to individuals and families who are affected by natural disasters, accidents, or other emergencies. By requiring Sekh to deposit Rs. 10,000 in this fund, the court is sending a message that individuals who violate the law must also take responsibility for their actions and contribute to the welfare of society in some way.

Overall, the court's decision in the case of Ajabul Sekh raises important questions about the protection of wildlife and the role of individuals in preserving it. While the court's decision to grant bail to Sekh suggests that there may be some ambiguity in the law regarding the possession of parts of wild animals, the court's imposition of certain conditions on Sekh's release on bail suggests that the court is also concerned with ensuring that individuals who violate the law take responsibility for their actions and contribute to the welfare of society in some way.
