The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by Balaji Automobiles challenging the legality of two notifications issued by the Regional Transport Authority and the Department of Transport, Government of Rajasthan. The first notification required permit holders of 15-year-old diesel-operated auto-rickshaws to replace their vehicles with LPG/CNG engine auto-rickshaws within 15 days. The second notification restricted the number of contract carriage permits for operating auto-rickshaw/auto tonga to 6000 and directed that new permits be issued only for vehicles operated by LPG/CNG fuel.

The petitioner argued that the ban on diesel auto-rickshaws, even if they were compatible with BS-IV engine, was illegal and arbitrary. The court considered the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the notifications issued by the Central and State Governments and dismissed the writ petition. The court noted that the additional restriction imposed by the State Government was not within the scope of provisions of Section 74 (3) (a) of the Act or the notification issued by the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred under the said provision.

The court also discussed the matter with regard to emission of smoke, vapour etc. from the motor vehicles, which is regulated by Rule 115 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The court observed that sub-rule (21) of Rule 115 is very vague and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India while reading down the said provision. The court used its power under Article 142 of the Constitution to read down sub-rule 21 of Rule 115 and directed that no motor vehicle conforming to the emission standard Bharat Stage IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country from 01.04.2020. The court also stated that vehicles which do not conform to the norms laid down by the Central Government under Rule 115 cannot be registered or substituted after the cutoff dates specified.

In summary, the court order dealt with two separate writ petitions filed by Balaji Automobiles challenging the legality of two notifications issued by the Regional Transport Authority and the Department of Transport, Government of Rajasthan. The court dismissed the first writ petition challenging the ban on diesel auto-rickshaws and noted that the additional restriction imposed by the State Government was not within the scope of provisions of Section 74 (3) (a) of the Act or the notification issued by the Central Government. The court also read down sub-rule 21 of Rule 115 and directed that no motor vehicle conforming to the emission standard Bharat Stage IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country from 01.04.2020. The court also stated that vehicles which do not conform to the norms laid down by the Central Government under Rule 115 cannot be registered or substituted after the cutoff dates specified.
