The court has granted the third bail application of Devendra Jatav, who was arrested by the Forest Department for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. The court has ordered that Jatav be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two local sureties each of Rs. 50,000. However, the court has imposed strict conditions on Jatav's release, including compliance with all terms and conditions of the bond, cooperation in the investigation/trial, and appearance before the trial court every month until the conclusion of the trial.

Jatav's case is related to the illegal hunting of wild animals and the possession of their body parts. The Forest Department had arrested Jatav in connection with the case and had opposed his bail application on the grounds that he was a repeat offender and that his release would hamper the investigation. However, Jatav's counsel argued that he was innocent and that he had been falsely implicated in the case.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, has allowed Jatav's bail application. The court has noted that Jatav has already spent a considerable amount of time in custody and that his continued detention would not serve any purpose. The court has also observed that Jatav has no criminal antecedents apart from the present case and that he is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

However, the court has imposed stringent conditions on Jatav's release to ensure that he does not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence. The court has directed Jatav to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the trial court every month until the conclusion of the trial. The court has also ordered Jatav to comply with all terms and conditions of the bond, including refraining from committing any offence while on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Jatav has been welcomed by his family and supporters. They have expressed relief that Jatav will be able to return home after spending several months in custody. However, they have also expressed concern about the conditions imposed by the court and have vowed to ensure that Jatav complies with them.

The case highlights the issue of illegal hunting and the possession of wild animal body parts, which is a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. The Forest Department has been cracking down on such offences and has been conducting raids and arrests across the country. The department has also been working with other agencies to curb the illegal trade in wild animal body parts, which is a lucrative business.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Devendra Jatav is a welcome relief for him and his family. However, the conditions imposed by the court reflect the seriousness of the charges against him and the need to ensure that he does not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence. The case highlights the need for stricter enforcement of laws related to the protection of wildlife and the preservation of natural habitats.
