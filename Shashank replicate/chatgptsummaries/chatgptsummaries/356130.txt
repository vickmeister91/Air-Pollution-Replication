The Gujarat Pollution Control Board filed a petition challenging an order that allowed the revision application of the accused, who were facing charges of starting polluting industries without proper permissions. The learned Additional Sessions Judge set aside the order for framing of charge on the ground that there was no proper sanction for prosecution. However, the Gujarat High Court clarified that the difference between sanction and authorization in the context of provisions of the Act is more semantic than real. The order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge was set aside, and the petition was allowed.

The case in question pertains to the establishment of polluting industries without proper permissions. The accused were facing charges for the same, and the learned Additional Sessions Judge had set aside the order for framing of charge on the ground that there was no proper sanction for prosecution. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board filed a petition challenging this order, which allowed the revision application of the accused.

The Gujarat High Court, while hearing the petition, clarified that the difference between sanction and authorization in the context of provisions of the Act is more semantic than real. The court observed that the provisions of the Act require authorization for the establishment of polluting industries, and the failure to obtain such authorization would render the establishment illegal. The court further noted that the provisions of the Act also require sanction for prosecution, which is a separate requirement from authorization.

The court held that the failure to obtain authorization for the establishment of polluting industries would not absolve the accused of their liability for prosecution. The court observed that the provisions of the Act require both authorization and sanction, and the absence of one would not negate the requirement of the other. The court further noted that the failure to obtain authorization would render the establishment illegal, but it would not affect the liability of the accused for prosecution.

The court also observed that the learned Additional Sessions Judge had erred in setting aside the order for framing of charge on the ground that there was no proper sanction for prosecution. The court held that the provisions of the Act require sanction for prosecution, but the absence of such sanction can be cured at a later stage. The court noted that the learned Additional Sessions Judge had not given any opportunity to the prosecution to cure the defect, and had instead set aside the order for framing of charge.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge and allowed the petition filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court held that the accused were liable to be prosecuted for the establishment of polluting industries without proper permissions, and that the absence of proper sanction for prosecution could be cured at a later stage.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of obtaining proper authorization for the establishment of polluting industries, as well as the requirement of sanction for prosecution under the provisions of the Act. The court clarified that the absence of one would not negate the requirement of the other, and that the absence of proper sanction for prosecution could be cured at a later stage. The case serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to comply with the provisions of the Act and obtain proper permissions before establishing polluting industries.
