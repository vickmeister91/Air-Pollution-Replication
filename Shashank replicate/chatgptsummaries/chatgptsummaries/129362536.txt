The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Premnarayan Joshi against Rajya Siksha Kendra. Joshi claimed that his services were terminated without any show cause notice or opportunity for a hearing. He was selected for the post of Clerk cum Computer Operator in 2007 and had been working since then. The court found that the principles of natural justice and fair play had been violated, and the impugned order was quashed. The court also explained the concept of natural justice and its importance in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice, which include the rules of 'nemo judex in causa sua' (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and 'audi alteram partem' (hear the other side). These principles are deeply rooted in tradition and conscience and are considered fundamental to fair adjudication. The court also notes that natural justice is firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and the right to procedural due process. The court orders the reinstatement of the petitioner in the case, along with backwages and all consequential benefits, as the respondents had discontinued his services without following any prescribed procedure.

The concept of natural justice is an essential aspect of administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a set of principles that ensure fairness and impartiality in decision-making. The principles of natural justice are based on the idea that every person has the right to be heard and that no one should be judged without being given a fair opportunity to present their case. The two fundamental principles of natural justice are 'nemo judex in causa sua' and 'audi alteram partem.'

The principle of 'nemo judex in causa sua' means that no one should be a judge in their own cause. This principle ensures that there is no bias or conflict of interest in decision-making. The principle of 'audi alteram partem' means that every person has the right to be heard. This principle ensures that every person has the opportunity to present their case and that no decision is made without considering all the relevant facts and evidence.

The court order in the case of Premnarayan Joshi highlights the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court found that the principles of natural justice and fair play had been violated in the case of Joshi, and his services were terminated without any show cause notice or opportunity for a hearing. The court quashed the impugned order and ordered the reinstatement of Joshi, along with backwages and all consequential benefits.

The court also explained that natural justice is firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, while Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. The court noted that the right to procedural due process is an essential aspect of Article 21 and that any violation of natural justice would be a violation of this fundamental right.
