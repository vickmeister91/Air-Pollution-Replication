The evaluation of minor mineral reserves in Jharkhand has been a contentious issue for some time. The state has a rich reserve of minerals, including coal, iron ore, and bauxite. However, the extraction of these minerals has been a source of conflict between the state government, mining companies, and local communities. The state government has been accused of granting mining leases without proper consultation with local communities and without considering the environmental impact of mining activities.

The court order is significant as it seeks to address some of these concerns. The DEIAA has been entrusted with the task of evaluating the reserve potential of minor minerals in the state. This is an important step as it will help to ensure that mining activities are carried out in a sustainable manner.

This information will be used to formulate a minor mineral policy for the state.
