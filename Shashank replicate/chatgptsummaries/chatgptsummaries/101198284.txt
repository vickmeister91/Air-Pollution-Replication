In a recent court order, Ramu Ram was granted bail in connection with FIR No. 99/2016 of Police Station Sandwa. Ramu Ram had been arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. The court directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. This bond was to ensure that Ramu Ram would appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The Arms Act, on the other hand, regulates the possession, manufacture, and sale of firearms. It aims to prevent the misuse of firearms and maintain public safety.

Ramu Ram's arrest was likely related to his alleged involvement in violating these laws. However, the court deemed it appropriate to grant him bail. Bail is a legal provision that allows a person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. It is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court as required and not engage in any further criminal activity.

In Ramu Ram's case, the court found that he was not a flight risk and was unlikely to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. Therefore, it granted him bail. However, the court also imposed certain conditions to ensure that Ramu Ram would comply with the legal process.

The first condition was that Ramu Ram had to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000. A personal bond is a legal document in which a person promises to appear in court as required. If the person fails to do so, they may be required to pay a penalty or forfeit the bond amount.

The second condition was that Ramu Ram had to provide two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. A surety is a person who promises to pay a certain amount of money if the person they are guaranteeing fails to comply with the legal process. In this case, the sureties were required to ensure that Ramu Ram would appear in court as required.

The court also directed Ramu Ram to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial. This was to ensure that he would not abscond or evade the legal process.

In conclusion, Ramu Ram was granted bail in connection with FIR No. 99/2016 of Police Station Sandwa. He was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. The court granted him bail on the condition that he would execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. He was also required to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial. These conditions were imposed to ensure that Ramu Ram would comply with the legal process and not engage in any further criminal activity.
