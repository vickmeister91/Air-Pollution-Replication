The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Ashish Kumar Shukla against South Eastern Coal Fields Limited. The petitioner sought a writ to stop the diversion work of Baghaiya Nala, alleging that the respondent was attempting to divert the river stream. The respondent, however, denied these allegations and provided permissions granted by statutory authorities.

Upon hearing the case, the court noted that the petitioner had not impleaded the concerned state authorities. As a result, the court did not entertain the petition. The petitioner was advised to approach the National Green Tribunal if they wished to pursue the matter further.

The court's decision to not entertain the petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had not included the relevant state authorities in the case. This was a crucial oversight, as the state authorities would have been responsible for granting the necessary permissions for the diversion work. Without their involvement, it was difficult for the court to make a decision on the matter.

The court's decision to advise the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal was based on the fact that this tribunal is specifically designed to handle cases related to environmental issues. As the petitioner's concerns were related to the diversion of a river stream, it was deemed appropriate for them to approach this tribunal for further action.

It is worth noting that the court's decision to vacate the interim relief was likely based on the fact that the petitioner had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims. Without this evidence, it was difficult for the court to justify the interim relief.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of including all relevant parties in a case. Failure to do so can result in the case being dismissed, as was the case here. Additionally, it underscores the importance of approaching the appropriate legal body for specific issues. In this case, the National Green Tribunal was deemed the appropriate body to handle the petitioner's concerns.
