The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ petitions filed by companies challenging the actions of the District Magistrate-cum-District Collector, Chittorgarh, in relation to the suspension and revocation of their manufacturing licenses under the Explosives Rules, 2008. The court orders provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the suspension and revocation of the licenses, as well as the subsequent actions taken by the petitioner-companies and the authorities involved.

In the first court order, M/s Super Shiv Shakti Chemicals Private Ltd. filed a writ petition against the objections raised by the District Magistrate-cum-District Collector, Chittorgarh, before the Chief Controller of Explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (CCE), in the case of revocation of the suspension of their manufacturing licenses. The licenses of the petitioner-company were suspended by CCE on 12.08.2016 and the said suspension was confirmed on 12.09.2016. The court order provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the suspension of the licenses and subsequent actions taken by the petitioner-company and the authorities involved.

The second court order discusses a series of letters and reports related to the resumption of manufacturing of slurry/emulsion explosives by a petitioner-company under license No. E23432. The District Collector, Chittorgarh, has refused to grant permission to the company to resume manufacturing due to objections raised by the Superintendent of Police and the Chief Conservator of Forest. A magisterial inquiry report has concluded that the accident that occurred in the factory premises was due to a short circuit and that the factory has adequate security arrangements. The Chief Controller of Explosives has conducted an inspection of the factory and submitted a report. The court order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The third court order pertains to the refusal of the District Collector to issue a no objection certificate to a petitioner's factory. The Chief Conservator of Forest has recommended the cancellation of the factory's permission due to its location within the boundaries of Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary and its excess area. The letter from the Deputy Conservator of Forest recommends cancellation of the permission due to the same reasons. The court order includes copies of the letters and mentions the relevant dates.

In the fourth court order, a company challenged the objections raised by the District Collector, Chittorgarh, in the matter of revocation of suspension of its licenses. The court has decided not to consider the grounds raised by the petitioner-company as the objections raised by the District Collector are without any basis and contrary to the observations and directions given by the court in an earlier order. The court has provided a detailed background of the case and the relevant orders passed by various authorities.

The fifth court order found that the District Magistrate and Divisional Commissioner violated the principles of natural justice in their orders to cancel a no objection certificate (NOC) for a company's explosives manufacturing unit. The court stated that the grounds for cancellation were not adequately specified in the notice served to the petitioner, and that the authorities did not provide the petitioner with an adequate opportunity to present their case. The court also found that the authorities considered grounds that were not even mentioned in the notice. The court ordered the annulment and setting aside of the orders to cancel the NOC. The court did not enter into the merits of the case, leaving them to be determined at an appropriate stage in appropriate proceedings.

The sixth court order pertains to a case where a District Collector cancelled the No Objection Certificate (NOC) of a company on the grounds that their factory was established on excess land and within a wildlife sanctuary. The court quashed the cancellation of the NOC and left it open for the District Magistrate to proceed against the company, if desired, but only after serving a proper notice and providing adequate opportunity of hearing to the company. The court also set aside objections raised by the District Collector in subsequent communications regarding the revocation of the company's explosives licenses. The court did not make any decision on whether the factory premises of the company were situated within the limits of the wildlife sanctuary or not.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of following due process and natural justice while taking actions against companies. The court has emphasized the need for authorities to provide adequate notice and opportunity of hearing to companies before taking any adverse actions. The court orders also provide insights into the procedures and regulations governing the manufacturing and storage of explosives in India.
