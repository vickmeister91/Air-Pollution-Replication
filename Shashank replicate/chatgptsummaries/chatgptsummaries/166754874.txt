The first court order pertains to a petition seeking to set aside a Mutation Entry and restore an earlier Mutation Entry in the records of rights pertaining to land in Taluka-Mulshi, District Pune. The impugned Mutation Entry treated the land as forest land, and the petitioner seeks to carry out non-forest activities on the land. The petitioner claims that the land was excluded from the purview of the Private Forest Act, 1975, and no notice was issued under section 35(3) of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The court reserved its judgment on April 12, 2017, and pronounced it on April 26, 2017.

The second court order discusses the issue of whether a piece of land constitutes a private forest under the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975. The court held that the land in question did not meet the criteria for being considered a private forest and therefore did not vest in the state government under Section 3 of the Act. The court also emphasized the mandatory nature of issuing notice under Section 35(3) of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 before declaring any land as private forest. The court's decision was limited to the status of the land under Section 2(f)(iii) of the Act and did not examine other provisions or laws.

The third court order sets aside an earlier order from March 14, 2012, and restores a previous mutation entry (no. 1062) for land in Devghar, Jambhulne, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune. There are no costs awarded.
