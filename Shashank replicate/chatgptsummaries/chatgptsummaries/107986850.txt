The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard an application for condonation of delay in a leave to appeal against the acquittal of respondents from charges under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The applicant, the M.P. Pollution Control Board, argued that the delay was due to departmental correspondence and should be condoned. The respondents opposed the prayer, but the court allowed the application, citing liberal construction of the Limitation Act and the fact that the delay was only 41 days. The matter was listed for a hearing in two weeks.

The case in question pertains to charges under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, which were brought against the respondents. The respondents were acquitted of these charges, and the M.P. Pollution Control Board subsequently filed an application for leave to appeal against the acquittal. However, the application was filed after the prescribed period of limitation, and the M.P. Pollution Control Board therefore sought condonation of delay.

The respondents opposed the prayer for condonation of delay, arguing that the M.P. Pollution Control Board had not provided any valid reason for the delay. However, the court allowed the application, citing liberal construction of the Limitation Act and the fact that the delay was only 41 days. The court noted that the delay was due to departmental correspondence, and that the M.P. Pollution Control Board had acted diligently in pursuing the matter.

The court's decision to allow the application for condonation of delay is significant, as it demonstrates the court's willingness to take a liberal approach to the interpretation of the Limitation Act. The court's decision also highlights the importance of diligence in pursuing legal matters, as the M.P. Pollution Control Board was able to secure condonation of delay due to its diligent pursuit of the matter.

The court's decision to allow the application for condonation of delay is also significant in that it allows the M.P. Pollution Control Board to pursue its appeal against the acquittal of the respondents. This is important in the context of environmental law, as it demonstrates the court's commitment to upholding the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

Overall, the court's decision to allow the application for condonation of delay is a positive development for the M.P. Pollution Control Board, as it allows the Board to pursue its appeal against the acquittal of the respondents. The court's decision also highlights the importance of diligence in pursuing legal matters, and the court's willingness to take a liberal approach to the interpretation of the Limitation Act.
