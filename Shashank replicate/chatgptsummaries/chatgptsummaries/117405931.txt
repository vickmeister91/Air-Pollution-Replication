The Allahabad Bank had filed a complaint case against Koutons Retails India Ltd. & Ors under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act). The lower court had passed an order in favor of the bank, which was challenged by the revisionist in a revision petition. The revisionist had raised objections regarding the evidence presented by the complainant, which were decided by the lower court. However, the court found no illegality or infirmity in the lower court's order and dismissed the revision petition.

The case pertains to a dishonored cheque issued by Koutons Retails India Ltd. & Ors in favor of Allahabad Bank. The bank had presented the cheque for payment, but it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The bank had then sent a notice to the accused, but they failed to make the payment within the stipulated time. Hence, the bank had filed a complaint case under section 138 of the NI Act.

During the trial, the bank had presented evidence in the form of the dishonored cheque, the notice sent to the accused, and the acknowledgement receipt of the notice. The accused had raised objections regarding the admissibility of the evidence, but the lower court had overruled the objections and passed an order in favor of the bank.

The revisionist had challenged the lower court's order on the grounds that the evidence presented by the complainant was not admissible. However, the court found that the lower court had correctly appreciated the evidence and had passed a well-reasoned order. The court also observed that the revisionist had not been able to point out any illegality or infirmity in the lower court's order.

The court directed the revisionist to appear before the trial court and proceed with the trial in accordance with the law. This means that the accused will have to face trial and present their defense before the trial court. The court's order is a setback for the accused, as they will have to face the trial and prove their innocence.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the NI Act. Dishonoring a cheque can lead to criminal prosecution under section 138 of the NI Act, which can result in imprisonment and fine. The accused in this case will have to face the consequences of their actions and prove their innocence before the trial court.

In conclusion, the court's order dismissing the revision petition filed by Koutons Retails India Ltd. & Ors against an order passed by a lower court in a complaint case filed by Allahabad Bank under section 138 of the NI Act is a setback for the accused. The court found no illegality or infirmity in the lower court's order and directed the revisionist to appear before the trial court and proceed with the trial in accordance with the law. The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the NI Act and the consequences of dishonoring a cheque.
