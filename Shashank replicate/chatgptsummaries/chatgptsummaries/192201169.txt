The Madras High Court recently passed a judgment on two writ petitions filed by Ranjeet Kumar against the Revenue Officer, Corporation of Chennai, and others. The first petition sought to quash a notice issued by the third respondent under Section 379(A) of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act and to direct the respondent to open the seal put on the premises. The second petition sought a writ of mandamus to renew the license of the petitioner to run a plastic manufacturing factory.

The court found that the petitioner was running the factory without a valid license and in violation of statutory provisions. The court dismissed both writ petitions. The judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of complying with statutory provisions and obtaining valid licenses before starting any business.

The first writ petition filed by the petitioner sought to quash a notice issued by the third respondent under Section 379(A) of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act. The notice was issued for the alleged violation of building rules and regulations. The petitioner contended that the notice was issued without any basis and that the seal put on the premises should be removed.

The court observed that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary licenses and approvals before starting the plastic manufacturing factory. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and had not obtained a license from the Corporation of Chennai to run the factory.

The court further observed that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act by constructing a building without obtaining the necessary approvals. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained a building plan approval from the Corporation of Chennai and had not obtained a completion certificate for the building.

The court held that the notice issued by the third respondent was valid and that the seal put on the premises was justified. The court observed that the petitioner had violated the statutory provisions and had not obtained the necessary licenses and approvals. The court dismissed the first writ petition filed by the petitioner.

The second writ petition filed by the petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to renew the license of the petitioner to run the plastic manufacturing factory. The petitioner contended that the license had expired and that the renewal application had been submitted to the Corporation of Chennai.

The court observed that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary licenses and approvals before starting the plastic manufacturing factory. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained a NOC from the TNPCB and had not obtained a license from the Corporation of Chennai to run the factory.

The court further observed that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act by running the factory without a valid license.

The judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of complying with statutory provisions and obtaining valid licenses before starting any business. The judgment also emphasizes the need for businesses to obtain the necessary approvals and licenses before starting operations.
