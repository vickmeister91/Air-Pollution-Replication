The court order pertains to a dispute between workmen and the management of M/s Birla Textile Mills regarding the closure of the mill in Delhi and its relocation to Baddi in Himachal Pradesh. The case involves the rights and benefits of the workmen employed by the industry. The court refers to directions issued by the Apex Court in 1996 and 1997 pertaining to the rights and benefits of the workmen, including continuity of employment, payment of full wages with continuity of service during the period between closure and restart of the industry, and payment of shifting bonus and compensation. The court also refers to certain issues with regard to interpretation of the directions, which led to filing of various applications, including contempt petitions before the Apex Court.

The court ruled that the period between the closure and restart of the mill should be treated as active employment, and workmen should be paid full wages with continuity in service. The workmen were to be treated as if they were in service in Delhi until the industry was restarted at the relocated place. The court also ordered the management to pay compensation to the workmen and clarified the wages payable to them. The workmen filed several petitions and demands, which were adjudicated by the Labour Court and challenged by the Union before the Apex Court. The Union's petition was dismissed, and the workmen filed individual petitions, which were allowed by the learned Single Judge of the Court. The decision was challenged in a bunch of LPAs filed on behalf of the respondent, and the learned Division Bench of the Court passed orders leaving the questions of law open. The court also noted a factual dispute regarding the payment of variable Dearness Allowance.

The court order requires the appellant(s) to file a statement showing the increase in variable Dearness Allowance in Delhi between 1996 and March 1999, and whether it was paid to workers who were relocated in March 1999 in H.P. The court also discusses the normal rule that all identically situated persons should be treated alike when given relief by the court, but there are exceptions such as laches, delays, and acquiescence. The court cites a Supreme Court case to explain that when a judgment is in personam, those who intend to benefit from it must show that their petition does not suffer from laches, delays, or acquiescence.

The court order discusses various cases and their implications. It mentions the Maharaj Krishna Bhatt case where the appellants approached the court for appointment as Sub-Inspectors of Police after the appointment of Abdul Rashid Rather. The court extended the benefit of the decision in Abdul Rashid Rather's case to the appellants. However, the court also notes that the respondents in the present case did not approach the court earlier and acquiesced into the termination orders, and approaching the court at such a belated stage was impermissible. The court cites the Rup Diamonds case to support its view that claims that have not been pursued for several years cannot be considered.

The court order discusses various cases where the principle of delay and laches was applied to deny relief to individuals who did not act promptly to challenge decisions or assert their rights. The court dismissed a writ petition for delay in approaching the court and refused to extend the benefit of judgment passed in respect of other similarly situated employees. The court also noted that delay and laches are important factors in exercise of discretionary relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Various other cases were cited to support this principle.

The court order discusses the principle of laches, which considers acquiescence on the claimant's part and any change of position that has occurred on the defendant's part in determining whether there has been a delay that amounts to laches. The order also states that the normal rule is that all similarly situated persons should be treated alike in service matters, but there are exceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as acquiescence. The order further explains that if the judgment of the court was in personam, those who want to get the benefit of the said judgment extended to them shall have to satisfy that their petition does not suffer from either laches and delays or acquiescence. The instant petition seeking extension of similar benefits as flow out from the judgment passed in LPA No. 69 of 2008, decided on 27.4.2012, and having been filed belately, would normally be covered under principle 22.2 and the petition filed would be liable to be dismissed.

The court order states that a petition seeking extension of benefits from a previous judgment would normally be dismissed due to delays, unless the previous judgment was intended to benefit all similarly situated persons. The petitioners were unable to prove that the previous judgment was in rem, and therefore, they cannot claim any benefit from it. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between workmen and the management of M/s Birla Textile Mills regarding the closure of the mill in Delhi and its relocation to Baddi in Himachal Pradesh. The court ruled that the period between the closure and restart of the mill should be treated as active employment, and workmen should be paid full wages with continuity in service. The court also ordered the management to pay compensation to the workmen and clarified the wages payable to them. The court discussed various cases and their implications, including
