The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Proficient Equipment Solutions against the Commissioner of Central Excise & Customs, Nagpur. The case involved determining whether certain activities undertaken by the appellant amounted to manufacture within Section 2(f)(iii) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and whether the goods were covered under Section 4 or/and Section 4A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 as parts of automobiles.

The Tribunal remanded the matter back to the learned Members of the CESTAT for considering the issue afresh by considering the rival submissions on behalf of both the parties. The case was heard on multiple occasions, and the learned Senior Counsel reiterated various submissions made by him during the hearing of JCB India Ltd.

The court order states that track laying or chain mounted vehicles, hydraulic excavators, and vehicles designed for off highway operations with on and off highway capabilities are considered as automotive vehicles. The machinery aspect of an automotive vehicle does not extinguish its identity as an automobile. The court also discusses the process of labelling or relabelling containers as deemed to be manufacture. The circulars and CBEC circulars are not binding instructions, and the adjudicating authority is not bound by them. The appellants are not entitled to CENVAT credit, and the plea of benefit of cum-duty cannot be extended. The extended period of limitation cannot be applied as the appellants were aware of the provisions of Section 4A.

The court order states that the appellant was aware of the provisions of Section 4A and had been paying CVD as per Section 4A for imported parts of Scania trucks. Therefore, it was their duty to take Central Excise registration and inform the local excise authorities of their activities of labelling, repacking, etc. The court also lists various parts that were being sold by the appellant and states that they are covered by the scope of the term parts, components, and sub-assemblies of automobiles. The court discusses relevant sections, notifications, and circulars related to the case. It also mentions a previous circular that is no longer valid due to a contrary judgment by the Tribunal.

The court order discusses a circular issued by the Central Board of Excise & Customs regarding the scope of entry No. 97 of the Notification No. 2/2006-C.E. (N.T.) inserted vide the amending Notification No. 11/2006-C.E. (N.T.). The circular defines the term "automobiles" and clarifies that all parts, components, and assemblies falling in any heading in the Tariff are covered. The court concludes that Loader, Backhoe Loaders & Road Rollers are motor vehicles and their parts, components, and assemblies are considered as "Parts, components, and assemblies of Automobile." The court also cites various judicial pronouncements to support its conclusion.

The court order discusses the definition of the term "automobile" and concludes that it includes a wide range of motor vehicles, not just cars. The order also states that parts, components, and assemblies of automobiles are covered by the Central Excise Act, including those of Loader, Backhoe Loader, and Road Roller. The court rejects the argument that dumpers are not automobiles just because they are used in mining areas. The order also notes that a circular from the Central Board of Excise and Customs is not binding if it contradicts judicial decisions.

The court order rejects the appellant's contention that dumpers are not automobiles and holds that they are. The order also states that motor graders, wheel loaders, dozers, and hydraulic excavators are also considered automobiles. The court notes that the definition of construction equipment vehicle includes rubber tyred and steel drum wheel mounted excavators and dozers. The court also upholds the Commissioner's submission that putting a tag on unpacked parts of automobiles amounts to manufacture under Section 2(f)(iii). The court rejects the appellant's argument that Section 2(f)(iii) only applies to excisable goods produced in India and not imported goods. The court also notes that the Notification relating to Section 4A was amended to replace the term automobile with specific headings of the Central Excise Act Tariff.

The court rejected the argument that the fact that inputs were imported is immaterial. The court found that the goods were covered by Section 2(f)(iii) and the appellant's activities amounted to manufacture. The court upheld the extended period of limitation and imposition of penalty under Section 11AC. The court also set aside the confiscation of goods and related redemption fine. The penalty imposed on the Head of Finance & Accounts of L&T Construction and Mining Machinery was set aside. The penalty imposed on M/s. Proficient Equipment Solutions, Nagpur under Rule 26 was also set aside. The court remanded the matter for the limited purpose of examining documents regarding admissibility of CENVAT credit.

In summary, the court order dealt with a case involving the determination of whether certain activities undertaken by the appellant amounted to manufacture within Section 2(f)(iii) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and whether the goods were covered under Section 4 or/and Section 4A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 as parts of automobiles. The court discussed various circulars, notifications, and sections related to the case and concluded that parts, components, and assemblies of automobiles are covered by
