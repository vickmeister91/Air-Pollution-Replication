The court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership in Indurthy Village, Marriguda Mandal, Nalgonda District. The land in question was originally owned by Kishan Rao and Srinivas Rao, and was rented out to Nallabothu Komaraiah, who later gave possession of a portion of the land to his nephew, Maddi Somaiah. The Tahsildar issued a certificate validating Maddi Somaiah's possession of the land in 1972. In 1984, the petitioners purchased 8 acres of land from Maddi Somaiah and have been cultivating it since. However, in 1993, Nallabothu Lingaiah, the son of Nallabothu Komaraiah, filed an application claiming to be the protected tenant for the entire extent of land and seeking restoration of possession. The Joint Collector and Additional District Magistrate, Nalgonda, allowed the appeal filed by Nallabothu Lingaiah and ordered restoration of possession in favor of the protected tenant. The petitioners challenged this order, arguing that they were bona fide purchasers and that the certificate validating Maddi Somaiah's possession was still in force. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order states that the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950, must be interpreted liberally and in favor of the protected tenant. The purpose of the Act is to protect the interests of the tenants, and Section 32 of the Act allows protected tenants to seek restoration of possession. The court also considers whether the claim of the protected tenant for restoration of possession is hit by delay and laches. The court emphasizes that while no time limit is prescribed to file an application seeking restoration by a protected tenant, the right has to be availed within a reasonable time. The court cites several precedents to highlight this principle. The court also emphasizes that if a possession is enjoyed by a third party with the acquiescence and approval of a protected tenant or his successors, the application for restoration under Section 32 of the Act is impermissible.

The court order states that the principle of estoppel and acquiescence are applicable to proceedings under Section 32 of the Act. If a protected tenant inducts a third party and vests possession of the property or subscribes to such transfers, they cannot fall back on provisions contained in Section 32 of the Act. The court held that if such a course of action is permitted, the whole object of the Act becomes defeated and becomes a tool in the hands of indiscriminate persons to take innocent purchasers for a ride. The court also stated that in cases of inordinate delay in invoking the provisions of a statute, an application should be rejected on that ground alone. The court found that the application for restoration of possession under Section 32 of the Act was not filed within a reasonable time and the order of the Joint Collector restoring possession is not sustainable. The court allowed the writ petition and set aside the order impugned in the writ petition.
