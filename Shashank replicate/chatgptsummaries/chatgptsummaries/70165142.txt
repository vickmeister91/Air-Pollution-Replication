The Patna High Court recently heard a case involving Reliance Infratel Ltd. and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner, Reliance Infratel Ltd., sought to quash notices issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board regarding the imposition of fees for filing consent applications. The petitioner argued that the rule of fee was illegal and arbitrary and ultra vires the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and decided to place the issue before the division bench for adjudication. The case was listed before the appropriate bench after obtaining permission of Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice.

The issue at hand was the imposition of fees for filing consent applications. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had issued notices to Reliance Infratel Ltd. regarding the imposition of fees for filing consent applications. The petitioner argued that the rule of fee was illegal and arbitrary and ultra vires the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution.

The petitioner argued that the imposition of fees for filing consent applications was not provided for under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner further argued that the imposition of fees was arbitrary and illegal and violated the principles of natural justice.

The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and held that the rule of fee was illegal and arbitrary and ultra vires the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court observed that the imposition of fees for filing consent applications was not provided for under the Act and was therefore illegal.

The court further observed that the imposition of fees was arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice. The court held that the Bihar State Pollution Control Board had no power to impose fees for filing consent applications and quashed the notices issued by the Board.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, are not violated. The decision also ensures that the Bihar State Pollution Control Board does not exceed its powers and acts within the framework of the law.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's decision in the case of Reliance Infratel Ltd. v. Bihar State Pollution Control Board is a significant one. The court's decision upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, are not violated.
