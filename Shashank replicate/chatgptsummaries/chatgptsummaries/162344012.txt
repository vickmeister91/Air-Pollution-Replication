The court order in question pertains to an application for bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for the appellant who has been in custody since 28.2.2015 in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case and that all offences are triable by a magistrate. The charge sheet has been filed, and the trial would take considerable time to conclude, therefore, he should be released on bail.

The court considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicant and observed that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court also noted that the offences alleged against the applicant are triable by a magistrate and that the charge sheet has already been filed. The court further observed that the trial would take considerable time to conclude, and therefore, the applicant should be released on bail.

The court allowed the application and directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in a sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the fact that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time. This is an important consideration as prolonged detention can have a detrimental effect on an individual's physical and mental health. Secondly, the court noted that the offences alleged against the applicant are triable by a magistrate. This means that the trial would not take place in a higher court, which would have a longer trial period. Thirdly, the court observed that the charge sheet has already been filed. This means that the prosecution has completed its investigation and has submitted its evidence to the court. Finally, the court considered the fact that the trial would take considerable time to conclude. This is an important consideration as it means that the applicant would have to remain in custody for an extended period of time if bail is not granted.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is also based on the principle of presumption of innocence. This principle holds that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is not a reflection of his guilt or innocence but is based on the fact that he has a right to be released on bail pending trial.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors, including the fact that he has been in custody for a considerable period of time, the offences alleged against him are triable by a magistrate, the charge sheet has already been filed, and the trial would take considerable time to conclude. The court's decision is also based on the principle of presumption of innocence, which holds that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in a sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.
