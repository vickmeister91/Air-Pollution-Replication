The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s Lilliput & Anr for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable as the DPCC had no authority to file it. The complainant argued that the complaint was filed by an authorized officer in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board and with the prior approval of the Member Secretary. The court considered the arguments and relevant provisions of the law and decided that the complaint was maintainable.

The court order discusses sections 19 and 24 of the EP Act, which state that no court can take cognizance of an offense under the Act except on a complaint made by the Central Government or an authorized officer. The order also cites previous court cases to interpret the language of Section 20(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, which requires written consent from the Central or State Government or an authorized person to institute a prosecution for an offense under the Act. The court clarifies that a person authorized to file a complaint can give written consent for prosecution, and this is not a delegation of power. The order also discusses a case where the delegation of powers under the Act was questioned, and the court held that the expression "take proceedings" in Section 481 of the Act means instituting a complaint and not just causing a complaint to be filed.

The court order discusses the delegation of powers under the Municipal Corporation Act and the issue of who can take proceedings against those charged with offenses under the Act. The court concludes that only the authorities mentioned in the Act can launch proceedings and that an officer of the municipality must perform their duties themselves unless expressly authorized to delegate them. The court also notes that technicalities pertaining to non-filing of a complaint by an authorized person cannot be cured at any stage of litigation.

The court order states that if a special provision for taking cognizance of an offense is present under the statute, the complainant requesting the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offense must satisfy the eligibility criteria prescribed by the statute. In this case, the present complaint was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act, and the authorization given by the DPCC was not valid. The court held that the complaint was not maintainable, and therefore, no charge could be framed against the accused. The accused was discharged, and the bail bond and surety were canceled.
