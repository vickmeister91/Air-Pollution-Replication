The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a Special Civil Application that challenged the maintainability of an appeal filed by respondent No. 1 before the Appellate Authority constituted under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner argued that the respondent had no locus standi to file the appeal, but the court held that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Board under Section 25, Section 26, or Section 27 of the Act has a right of appeal.

The court noted that the petitioner could challenge the interlocutory order in a Special Civil Application to be filed against the final decision given in the appeal by the Appellate Authority. The court directed the Appellate Authority to decide the appeal within three months from the date of receipt of the writ of this order.
