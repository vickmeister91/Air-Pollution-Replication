The case in question involves a petition filed by Amar Singh Jadaun under Section 482Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.3, Badi, Dholpur. The order in question refused to release Jadaun's tractor and trolley, which had been seized as case property in FIR No.39/2019, registered at Police Station Sarmathura, Dholpur. The tractor and trolley were seized in connection with offences under Sections 379 IPC, Section 29, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act and Sections 30, 31, 32, 41 and 42 of Indian Forest Act.

Jadaun's petition was allowed by the court, which directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property, subject to certain conditions. The petitioner was required to keep the tractor and trolley intact and not change their identification. Additionally, the petitioner was required to produce the tractor and trolley as and when the trial court required them for proposed identification of the case property.

Furthermore, the petitioner was required to execute a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it deemed fit.

The court's decision to release the tractor and trolley was based on the fact that they were not required as evidence in the case and were not likely to be used for any illegal purposes. The court also took into consideration the fact that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to impose conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley was aimed at ensuring that they were not misused or tampered with in any way. The requirement for the petitioner to execute a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties was aimed at ensuring that the petitioner would comply with the conditions imposed by the court.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of ensuring that case property is not misused or tampered with in any way. The court's decision to release the tractor and trolley subject to certain conditions was aimed at striking a balance between the interests of justice and the rights of the petitioner.
