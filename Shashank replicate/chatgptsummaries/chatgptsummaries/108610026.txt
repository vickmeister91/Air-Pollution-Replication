The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of water pollution in various districts of Rajasthan. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by Dipti Swaroop against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court also directed the registry to find out the status of a related PIL transferred by the High Court of Rajasthan.

The second court order discusses a case regarding pollution in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal. The court directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples and analyze them. The state is also directed to come up with short and long-term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination. The court imposes a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this through media. The court also requests the High Court to hand over the records of the case to them. The state is directed to submit a comprehensive plan and action report, failing which a fine will be imposed. The District Collector is directed to be present on the next hearing date.

The third court order, dated August 21, 2015, directed the State of Rajasthan to furnish a copy of the compliance report to the applicant. The State failed to comply with the directions, and the court ordered the State to furnish a copy of all compliance reports to the applicant. The court directed the State to remove all encroachments within one month from the date of the order. The State was also directed to issue a show cause notice to persons causing pollution and to remove existing structures contributing to pollution. The compliance report was to be filed by January 29, 2016. The State was also directed to issue notices to persons contributing to pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and deposit it in the Environmental Relief Fund.

The fourth court order ordered the state to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000 to be deposited in the Environment Relief Fund. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and for the state to file a compliance report. The court expressed disappointment with the state's lack of compliance and warned of appropriate action if the directions were not followed. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that those aggrieved with the state's actions should approach the National Green Tribunal. The court also discussed the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The final court order discusses the circumstances under which a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued, even if an appeal or revision is available. It states that if an inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction, or in a manner contrary to natural justice, a superior court may issue a writ to correct the error. However, the court also notes that the availability of alternative remedies may be considered, and that a writ court has discretion in deciding whether to invoke writ jurisdiction. The order ultimately dismisses a writ petition and allows the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal with appropriate applications or representations.
