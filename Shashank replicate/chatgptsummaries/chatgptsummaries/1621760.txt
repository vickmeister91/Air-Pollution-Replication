The court orders in question pertain to a dispute over a property in Calcutta. The defendant was a tenant of the property, with the Official Trustee of West Bengal acting as the landlord. The plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant for eviction from the property, citing default in payment of rent and wrongful subletting of the premises without the written consent of the landlord. During the pendency of the suit, the defendant filed a proceeding under Section 41 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882, against the plaintiff for recovery of possession of the property, claiming that the plaintiff was a sub-tenant in exclusive possession of the premises since August 1962.

The learned Judge allowed the defendant's application under Section 41 of the Act and made an order for possession. The plaintiff then filed a suit seeking a declaration that they were a tenant under the defendant in respect of the property and a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from executing the order for possession. The defendant contested the claim on its merits and also raised a plea that the suit was barred by principles of res judicata in view of the earlier two decisions between the parties.

The earlier decisions referred to a case where the defendant had been involved in a similar case with the Official Trustee, where the plaintiff had been added as a co-defendant. The court had found that the plaintiff was not a sub-tenant under the defendant, and the suit was dismissed. The plaintiff in the current case argued that the previous decision did not operate as res judicata and that the court should decide the other issues involved. However, the court held that the previous decision did operate as res judicata and barred the plaintiff's claim in the current suit.

The plaintiff appealed against the judgment and decree passed by the learned Judge, 2nd Bench, City Civil Court, Calcutta in Title Suit No. 999 of 1980. The suit had been dismissed on a preliminary issue holding the suit to be barred by principles of res judicata. The plaintiff argued that the previous decision should not be considered res judicata as it was based on a technicality and that the court should decide the other issues involved.

The court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff, stating that the previous decision should be considered res judicata and that all issues decided in the previous case should be binding in the current case. The court held that the previous decision was not based on a technicality and that the plaintiff was attempting to re-litigate the same issue that had already been decided. The court also refused the plaintiff's request for leave to appeal.

In summary, the court orders relate to a dispute over a property in Calcutta, where the plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant for eviction. The defendant had previously been involved in a similar case with the Official Trustee, where the plaintiff had been added as a co-defendant, and the court had found that the plaintiff was not a sub-tenant under the defendant. The plaintiff argued that the previous decision did not operate as res judicata, but the court held that it did and barred the plaintiff's claim in the current suit. The plaintiff appealed against the decision, but the court ultimately ruled in favor of the defendant, stating that the previous decision should be considered res judicata and that all issues decided in the previous case should be binding in the current case.
