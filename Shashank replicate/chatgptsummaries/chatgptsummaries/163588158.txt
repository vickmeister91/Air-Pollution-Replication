The court order in question pertains to criminal revisions filed by Balaraja against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate in STC No.62 of 2012. The petitioner had filed applications under section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act and under section 91 of Cr.P.C, which were dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner alleged that his signature was forged and that the opinion of a handwriting expert was necessary. However, the applications were rejected by the learned Judicial Magistrate, who observed that the accused had adopted dilatory tactics under the guise of examining defence witnesses. The court found no reason to interfere with the orders passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate and dismissed both the revisions.

The case at hand involves allegations of forgery and the use of dilatory tactics by the accused. The petitioner, Balaraja, had filed applications under section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act and under section 91 of Cr.P.C, seeking the opinion of a handwriting expert and the production of certain documents respectively. However, these applications were dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, who found that the accused was using these applications as a means of delaying the proceedings.

Balaraja had alleged that his signature had been forged and that the opinion of a handwriting expert was necessary to prove this. However, the learned Judicial Magistrate found that there was no evidence to support this claim and that Balaraja was merely using this as a means of delaying the proceedings. The court agreed with this finding and found no reason to interfere with the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate.

Similarly, Balaraja had also filed an application under section 91 of Cr.P.C, seeking the production of certain documents. However, the learned Judicial Magistrate found that these documents were not relevant to the case and that Balaraja was merely using this application as a means of delaying the proceedings. The court agreed with this finding and dismissed the revision filed by Balaraja.

Overall, the court found that Balaraja was using these applications as a means of delaying the proceedings and that there was no evidence to support his claims of forgery. The court therefore dismissed both the revisions filed by Balaraja and upheld the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate.

This case highlights the importance of ensuring that applications filed in court are relevant and supported by evidence. The court will not tolerate the use of dilatory tactics and will dismiss applications that are merely intended to delay the proceedings. It is therefore important for litigants to ensure that their applications are supported by evidence and are relevant to the case at hand. Failure to do so may result in the dismissal of their applications and a delay in the resolution of their case.
