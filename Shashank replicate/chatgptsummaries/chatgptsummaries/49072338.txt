A civil suit was filed by Mohan Lal Kukreja and Rajan Kukreja, legal heirs of Late Sh. Nischal Das, seeking a mandatory injunction to restrain the defendants, Registered Society Behariji Sewak Mandal, from carrying out illegal construction and interfering with the peaceful occupation of the suit premises. The plaintiffs claimed adverse possession of the property and accused the defendants of unauthorized construction, illegal demolition, and encroachment. The defendants denied the allegations and claimed that they were carrying out permissible repairs. The court framed issues and heard evidence from the plaintiffs, but the defendants did not lead any evidence. The court reserved its order, which was delivered on November 30, 2013, in favor of the plaintiffs.

However, the court order pertains to a case between Mohan Lal Kukreja and Registered Society Behariji Sewak Mandal, where the court found that the defendant did not encroach upon the plaintiff's property or carry out any illegal construction. The plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support their claims, and the court dismissed the case. The court also found that the suit was not bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. The parties were left to bear their own costs.

The case revolved around the ownership and possession of a property, where the plaintiffs claimed adverse possession of the property and accused the defendants of unauthorized construction, illegal demolition, and encroachment. The defendants, on the other hand, denied the allegations and claimed that they were carrying out permissible repairs. The court framed issues and heard evidence from the plaintiffs, but the defendants did not lead any evidence.

After considering the evidence presented by the plaintiffs, the court reserved its order, which was delivered on November 30, 2013, in favor of the plaintiffs. The court granted a mandatory injunction to restrain the defendants, Registered Society Behariji Sewak Mandal, from carrying out illegal construction and interfering with the peaceful occupation of the suit premises.

However, in a subsequent case between Mohan Lal Kukreja and Registered Society Behariji Sewak Mandal, the court found that the defendant did not encroach upon the plaintiff's property or carry out any illegal construction. The plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support their claims, and the court dismissed the case. The court also found that the suit was not bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. The parties were left to bear their own costs.

The court's decision in the second case contradicts its earlier decision in favor of the plaintiffs. It appears that the plaintiffs were unable to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of adverse possession and illegal construction by the defendants. The defendants, on the other hand, were able to successfully defend themselves against the allegations made by the plaintiffs.

The case highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support one's claims in court. Without proper evidence, it is difficult to convince the court of one's position, and the case may be dismissed. It also emphasizes the need for parties to ensure that all necessary parties are joined in the suit to avoid any issues of non-joinder.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a civil suit filed by Mohan Lal Kukreja and Rajan Kukreja, legal heirs of Late Sh. Nischal Das, seeking a mandatory injunction to restrain the defendants, Registered Society Behariji Sewak Mandal, from carrying out illegal construction and interfering with the peaceful occupation of the suit premises. While the court initially ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a subsequent case found that the defendant did not encroach upon the plaintiff's property or carry out any illegal construction, and the case was dismissed. The case highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support one's claims in court and ensuring that all necessary parties are joined in the suit.
