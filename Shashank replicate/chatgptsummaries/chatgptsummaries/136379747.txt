In a recent case, a petitioner filed a criminal original petition against HDFC Bank, seeking a direction to the respondent police to register a complaint against the bank for not returning original documents despite the petitioner having paid all dues. The Inspector of Police issued summons to HDFC Bank, and the bank replied that the allegation was false and that the documents were released in 2001. 

The court examined the matter and found that the loan was closed in 2001 and that the petitioner was making a false claim in 2016. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support their claim that the bank had not returned the original documents. The court also noted that the petitioner had not approached the bank or any other authority to seek redressal of their grievance before filing the petition.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not followed the due process of law and had directly approached the court without exhausting other available remedies. The court held that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition and that the petition was liable to be dismissed.

The court closed the petition with liberty to the petitioner to work out their remedy in the manner known to law. This means that the petitioner is free to approach the appropriate authority or forum to seek redressal of their grievance in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court has dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner against HDFC Bank for not returning original documents. The court has held that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition and that the petition was liable to be dismissed. The court has given the petitioner the liberty to work out their remedy in the manner known to law.
