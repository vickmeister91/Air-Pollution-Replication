The first court order pertains to a revisional petition filed by Lal Singh Arya against an interlocutory order passed in a special sessions trial. The order allowed three applications under Sections 91, 311 & 319 of the Cr.P.C. preferred by the victim. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that he was not given an opportunity to be heard before being added as an accused under Section 319. The court held that while Section 319 does not explicitly provide for prior hearing, the principle of natural justice is inherent in the provision and an accused must be heard before being added. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to implicate the petitioner in the murder of the deceased.

The second court order discusses a dispute regarding whether there can be more than one FIR in relation to the same incident or different incidents arising from the same occurrence. The court cites previous cases and concludes that the trial court should have given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before invoking Section 319 Cr.P.C. The court also states that material besides evidence adduced before the court during trial cannot be used for the purpose of invoking Section 319 for arraying the petitioner as an accused. The court sets aside the order passed by the trial court and directs the trial judge to afford the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before deciding the application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. in accordance with the law laid down by the Apex Court.

The court order in the case of Lal Singh Arya is significant as it clarifies the principle of natural justice in relation to Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. The provision allows a court to add any person, not being the accused before it, to the proceedings if it appears from the evidence that such person has committed any offence for which he could be tried together with the accused. The court held that while the provision does not explicitly provide for prior hearing, the principle of natural justice requires that an accused must be heard before being added. This is in line with the fundamental principle of audi alteram partem, which means that no one should be condemned unheard.

The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to implicate the petitioner in the murder of the deceased. This is significant as it shows that the court carefully considered the evidence before making its decision. It is important for courts to carefully consider the evidence before adding any person as an accused under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. This ensures that the rights of the accused are protected and that justice is served.

The court order in the second case is significant as it clarifies the law regarding the invocation of Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. The provision allows a court to add any person, not being the accused before it, to the proceedings if it appears from the evidence that such person has committed any offence for which he could be tried together with the accused. The court held that material besides evidence adduced before the court during trial cannot be used for the purpose of invoking Section 319 for arraying the petitioner as an accused. This means that the court cannot rely on material that has not been presented before it during the trial to add any person as an accused under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C.

The court also held that the trial court should have given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before invoking Section 319 Cr.P.C. This is in line with the principle of natural justice discussed in the first court order. It is important for courts to give all parties an opportunity to be heard before making any decision that affects their rights.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed above are significant as they clarify the law regarding the invocation of Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice in relation to the provision. The orders emphasize the importance of carefully considering the evidence before adding any person as an accused under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. and giving all parties an opportunity to be heard before making any decision that affects their rights. These principles are essential for ensuring that justice is served and the rights of all parties are protected.
