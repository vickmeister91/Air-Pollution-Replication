In a recent court order, Bachnaram, who was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act, was granted bail in connection with FIR No. 99/2016 of Police Station Sandwa District Churu. The court directed Bachnaram to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each for his appearance before the trial court on each date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The Arms Act, on the other hand, regulates the possession, manufacture, and sale of firearms in India. Bachnaram was arrested for violating these laws, and the court deemed it necessary to grant him bail.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody until their trial. The court may grant bail if it is satisfied that the accused will not abscond or tamper with evidence and will cooperate with the investigation. In Bachnaram's case, the court found it appropriate to grant him bail, subject to certain conditions.

The court directed Bachnaram to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that they will appear before the court on each date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial. The sureties are persons who guarantee that the accused will comply with the conditions of the bond. They are required to deposit a certain amount of money with the court as security.

The court's decision to grant bail to Bachnaram is significant as it reflects the principle of presumption of innocence. This principle holds that a person is innocent until proven guilty. By granting bail, the court has recognized that Bachnaram has not been convicted of any offence and is entitled to his freedom until his trial is completed.

In conclusion, the court's order granting bail to Bachnaram in connection with FIR No. 99/2016 of Police Station Sandwa District Churu is a significant development in the case. The court has recognized the principle of presumption of innocence and has granted bail subject to certain conditions. Bachnaram will have to execute a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each for his appearance before the trial court on each date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial.
