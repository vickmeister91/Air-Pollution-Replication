The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner to quash an order cancelling his long-running Jamabandi of land in Bokaro, Jharkhand. The land was initially settled in the name of the petitioner's grandfather in an auction proceeding in 1933. The petitioner's Jamabandi was cancelled on the grounds that it was illegal and false as per section 4(h) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950. The petitioner argued that the concerned authorities ignored documents produced by him which were about 80 years old and that the long-running Jamabandi cannot be cancelled by initiating a proceeding under Section 4(h) of the Act, 1950 as a summary proceeding. The court heard both parties and perused the materials available on record.

The second court order discusses a case where a land was recorded as Gair Abad Malik, showing the nature of the land as Jungle Jhari, which was notified as protected forest. The Circle Officer recommended for cancellation of Jamabandi under Section 4(h) of the Act, 1950, and the matter was referred to the Court of Additional Collector, Bokaro, and Misc. 4(h) Case No.110 of 2016-17 was instituted, which was disposed of by the impugned order dated 9.9.2016, and the same was confirmed by the State Government vide letter contained in Memo No.6387 dated 15.12.2016. The petitioner contended that the proceeding under section 4(h) of the Act, 1950, can be initiated only to look into the legality of the transfer of land made after 1st January 1946 so as to find out whether the same had been made with an object to defeat the provisions of this Act or for causing loss to the State or for obtaining higher compensation. The court found that the learned court below has exceeded its jurisdiction while passing the impugned order. The respondents claimed proprietary right upon the said land on the ground that the same is Gair Abad Malik (Jungle-jhari) and as such, by reasons of the promulgation of the Act, 1950, the same has vested in the Government. The court found that the case of the petitioner is that before the issuance of the said notification, the land was already acquired by his ancestor vide Certificate Case No.191/1933.

The third court order pertains to the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and a judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkapad etc. vs. Union of India & Ors. The order clarifies that the provisions of the Act apply to all forests, irrespective of ownership or classification, and that the term 'forest' includes any area recorded as forest in government records. The order quashes an impugned order and consequential orders passed by the respondent authorities but allows them to take appropriate recourse before a civil court if they claim title of the government over the said land.
