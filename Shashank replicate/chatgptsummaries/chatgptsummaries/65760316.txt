The court has recently issued two orders in relation to writ petitions filed by different parties. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by Shah Brothers, a partnership firm, seeking the issuance of a writ, order or direction to the State Government to issue Transit Challans to the petitioner. The respondent-Union of India and the State of Jharkhand have raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition. The court has directed the petitioner to furnish all necessary details and documents within one week by filing a supplementary affidavit to its Revision Application. The matter has been posted for hearing on 15.05.2018.

The second order relates to a demand for non-payment issued by the respondent-State and stopped them from issuing mining challans to the petitioner. The court has quashed the demand and constituted a committee to correct the demand for financial year 2005-06. The respondent-State needs to clarify their stand taken in the counter-affidavit. The matter has been adjourned to seek instructions on whether the respondent-State intends to challenge the revisional order. The case will be finally disposed of on 27.06.2018.
