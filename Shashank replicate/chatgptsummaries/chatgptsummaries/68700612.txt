The Custom, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal recently heard a case between M/S. Jubilant Industries Ltd and Cce, Ghaziabad regarding liability to service tax on certain activities carried out by PMSL during the period April 07 to Nov 2010. The demand for service tax was confirmed along with interest and penalties. The appellant filed a petition for withdrawing the appeal in respect of the normal period of limitation and wanted to contest only the demand beyond the normal period of limitation. The High Court ordered that the Tribunal should take note of section 86(4) of Finance Act, 1994 and pass an appropriate order on merits. The dispute was about whether the activity done by the appellant amounted to the manufacture of excisable goods and excise duty on such goods was being paid by Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd.

The court order pertains to a contract between PMSL and JUBILANT for the coordination of purchases, logistics, supervision of storage and consumption of raw materials, production planning and supervision, quality control, warehousing of products, and their dispatch. JUBILANT is required to make payment within 30 days of receipt of the bill for job charges after reconciling the complete accounts of manufactured products. The court determines that the activity undertaken by PMSL during the period of April 2007 to September 2009 was a manufacturing activity and cannot be classified as business support service and subjected to service tax. The appeal for the period of October 2009 to November 2010 is dismissed as withdrawn.
