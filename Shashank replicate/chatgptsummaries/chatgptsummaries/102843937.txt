The Supreme Court of India recently heard a petition for Special Leave to Appeal filed by the Secretary of the Kerala State Coastal Management Authority against DLF Universal Limited and others. The case involves several petitions related to a final judgment and order passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in 2016. The court reserved judgment after hearing arguments from both sides and granted permission for written submissions to be filed within a week.

The case revolves around the alleged violation of coastal zone regulations by DLF Universal Limited and others. The Kerala State Coastal Management Authority had issued a notice to DLF Universal Limited in 2011, alleging that the company had violated the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991 by constructing a building in an area that was designated as a Coastal Regulation Zone. The company challenged the notice in the National Green Tribunal, which dismissed the petition in 2013. The company then approached the High Court of Kerala, which also dismissed the petition in 2016.
