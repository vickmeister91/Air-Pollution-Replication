The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by P.C. Natarajan and others on behalf of three village panchayats. The petitioners sought to quash an order by the District Collector, Ramanathapuram, which permitted the installation of pump wells in three villages to draw water for drinking purposes for Mandapam Town Panchayat. The petitioners argued that the scheme would deprive villagers of their water rights and violate environmental protection laws.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the scheme was necessary due to a lack of water sources in the area and that measures had been taken to prevent depletion of good quality water and intrusion of sea water. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered relevant reports before making a decision.

The court order states that the District Collector has chosen a sand-dune area to supply drinking water to Mandapam Town Panchayat, which is situated 15 km away, after obtaining reports from geological experts and the State Ground Water Division. The order dismisses the contention of the villagers that their wells will become dry and there is a possibility of seepage of sea water. The court finds no reason to reject the reports of the experts and states that the order passed by the District Collector after a thorough enquiry cannot be said to be invalid.

The writ petition filed by the villagers seeking to quash the District Collector's order was dismissed by the court. The court found that the scheme was necessary to provide drinking water to Mandapam Town Panchayat and that the reports of the experts supported the decision of the District Collector. The court also noted that measures had been taken to prevent depletion of good quality water and intrusion of sea water.

The court order highlights the importance of balancing the needs of different communities when it comes to water resources. While the villagers had concerns about their water rights and the potential impact of the scheme on the environment, the court found that the scheme was necessary to provide drinking water to Mandapam Town Panchayat. The court also noted that measures had been taken to address the concerns raised by the villagers.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of considering all relevant factors when making decisions about water resources. It is important to balance the needs of different communities and to take steps to protect the environment while ensuring that everyone has access to clean drinking water. The court's decision in this case reflects a careful consideration of all relevant factors and a commitment to finding a solution that works for everyone involved.
