The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Gurdev Singh regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In another court order, the State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples from distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state had planned to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal to prevent contamination, but the court requested a report on the progress of these plans. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court ordered the District Collector of Ganga Nagar to be present on the next hearing date and warned that a cost would be imposed if the state failed to submit the long and short term plans and action taken report. The court also directed the state to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order pertained to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water in Sriganganagar. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to pollution and to show cause as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The court observed that the notices issued were not in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal. The State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, or appropriate action would be taken. The court also directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water.

In another court order, the Counsel for the State was given another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also ordered the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to the environment. The court also discussed the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The final court order stated that the petitioner was seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concluded that the Tribunal had ample power to condone the delay and that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of this country. The writ petition was dismissed accordingly. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Such application/representation shall be filed by 31st December, 2016. Till 31st December, 2016, the State authorities were restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s).
