The Karnataka High Court received a public interest litigation from residents of Banashankari Extension I Stage, Block-I, who were concerned about the location and operation of industries and industrial enterprises in a residential area in violation of the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act. The petitioners alleged that the industries were being run in Sy. Nos. 39/1, 39/2A and 39/2B of Yediyur Nagasandra village, Bangalore, and that the concerned authorities had failed to enforce relevant laws and regulations. The petitioners sought a declaration that the change in land use was illegal, and a writ of mandamus to remove the industrial units and enforce the law. The respondents denied the allegations and argued that the writ petition was not maintainable due to laches and lack of legal right. The court considered the arguments and examined the relevant provisions of the Act before making a decision.

The court order discusses a case where industrial buildings were constructed in an area earmarked for residential use in violation of the Karnataka Town & Country Planning Act. The court found that the concerned authorities and industrialists did not rebut the allegations made against them, and therefore, the allegations were presumed to be true. The court also noted that there was no compliance with various provisions of the law, including Section 14 to 17 of the Act, Section 32 of the B.D.A. Act, Section 505 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, Sections 6 to 10 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, and Sections 13 and 17 to 20 of the Karnataka Religious and Charitable Endowments Act. The court held that the petitioners had established their case against the authorities and establishments involved.

The court order states that any extension or layout of buildings must have written approval from the Authority and comply with their specified conditions. The transfer of land to industrialists must also comply with certain regulations. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving the environment and protecting it as a basic human right. The court also notes that citizens have the right to sue for the enforcement of statutory obligations and that the court has the duty to weigh the public interest of justice against the public authority's conduct. The court finds that there is sufficient evidence of air and noise pollution affecting the public and that the writ petition should be allowed. The court cites several British court decisions that support the principle of citizens having standing to bring matters to court to vindicate the rule of law and protect the public interest.
