The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Parmanand Korche, who was apprehensive of being arrested in a case registered against him under Sections 34(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Excise Act, 1915 and 467 and 471 of the IPC. The prosecution alleged that Korche, who is the Assistant District Excise Officer, was responsible for the transportation of 1000 cartons of factory-made country liquor from M/s. Great Galleon Ltd. (CS-1B) (Bottling Unit) Garra, Balaghat, to the named Warehouse situated at Umaria upon a transit permit. However, the holograms affixed on the bottles of liquor were not in accordance with the procedure and rules, and the batch numbers mentioned in the transit permit did not match those inscribed on the cartons.

The court granted bail with certain conditions, including that Korche must appear before the Investigating Officer on or before 27.10.2016 for interrogations and submission of documentary proofs of his permanent residential address and contact numbers, if any. The court also directed Korche to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses. The court further ordered that Korche must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.

In another case, the Madras High Court granted bail to a man who was accused of cheating and forgery. The accused, S. Senthil Kumar, was alleged to have forged documents and cheated a bank of Rs. 1.5 crore. The prosecution argued that Kumar had created fake documents to obtain a loan from the bank and had subsequently defaulted on the repayment. The prosecution further alleged that Kumar had absconded after the fraud was discovered and had been on the run for several months.

However, the defense argued that Kumar had been falsely implicated in the case and that he had not committed any fraud or forgery. The defense further argued that Kumar had cooperated with the investigation and had surrendered before the court voluntarily. The defense also pointed out that Kumar had no criminal antecedents and that he was a law-abiding citizen.

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to Kumar on the condition that he deposit a sum of Rs. 1 lakh as security and that he cooperate with the investigation. The court also directed Kumar not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and to attend all court hearings.

In a third case, the Delhi High Court granted bail to a man who was accused of raping a minor girl. The accused, Ravi Kumar, was alleged to have raped a 14-year-old girl in his house. The prosecution argued that Kumar had lured the girl to his house on the pretext of giving her a job and had then raped her. The prosecution further alleged that Kumar had threatened the girl with dire consequences if she reported the matter to the police.

However, the defense argued that Kumar had been falsely implicated in the case and that the girl had fabricated the allegations against him. The defense further argued that there was no medical evidence to support the allegations and that the girl had given contradictory statements to the police.

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to Kumar on the condition that he deposit a sum of Rs. 25,000 as security and that he cooperate with the investigation. The court also directed Kumar not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and to attend all court hearings.

In conclusion, the courts have granted bail to the accused in these cases on the condition that they cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings. The courts have also directed the accused not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission and to deposit a sum of money as security. The courts have taken into account the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense and have granted bail after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case.
