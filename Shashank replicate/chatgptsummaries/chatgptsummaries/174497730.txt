The first court order pertains to an industrial dispute between Shri Vinod Kumar and M/s. J.N. Enterprises. The dispute arose due to the termination of Shri Vinod Kumar's employment and whether it was illegal or unjustifiable. The court had initially passed an ex-parte order in favor of Shri Vinod Kumar, but the management filed an application to set aside the order. The matter was remanded back to the labor court for fresh disposal, and the workman challenged the order in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court. The original reference file had gone missing, and the workman filed a fresh statement of claim in 2014. The management claimed that the establishment was closed down due to orders from the Supreme Court and other authorities. The court proceeded with the matter and heard both parties' arguments.

The second court order discusses a claim made by a former employee of a factory who alleges that his services were illegally terminated. The management denies having any relationship with the claimant and states that the factory has been closed since 1997. The court frames issues related to the closure of the factory and the existence of an employer-employee relationship. The burden of proof is on the claimant to prove the relationship, but no evidence is presented. The court ultimately finds in favor of the management and dismisses the claim.

The third court order, in the case of "Ravi N. Tikoo Vs. Deputy Commissioner (S.W.) & Ors.", establishes that the burden of proof in an industrial claim rests on the workman, who must provide cogent and reliable evidence to establish their employment. The court also stated that engagement and appointment of a workman can be established through direct or circumstantial evidence, and that a self-serving affidavit is not sufficient proof. In this particular case, the claimant failed to provide any evidence to prove their employment, and therefore, the question of their services being illegally or unjustifiably terminated does not arise. The workman is not entitled to any relief.

In summary, the court orders highlight the importance of providing evidence to establish an employer-employee relationship in industrial disputes. The burden of proof lies with the workman, and a self-serving affidavit is not sufficient proof. In the absence of evidence, the court is likely to rule in favor of the management. The court orders also demonstrate the importance of maintaining proper records and documentation to avoid disputes and legal complications.
