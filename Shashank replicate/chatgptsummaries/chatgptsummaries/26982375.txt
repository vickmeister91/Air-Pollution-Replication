The Gujarat High Court recently issued two court orders pertaining to the protection of the Gosabara Wetland in Porbandar under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first court order was in response to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking protection for the wetland, alleging that fishing activity in the area was causing harm to the birds that visit the wetland. The second court order cancelled fishing licenses of fishermen who were granted permission to fish in the wetland where hunting of birds is also prohibited.

In the first court order, the court heard arguments from the petitioner, the state authorities, and a private respondent who argued that fishing is the only source of livelihood for the people in the area. The court noted that all licenses for fishing in the wetland had been cancelled and that no permanent ban had been imposed on fishing. The court restricted the case to the Gosabara Wetland at Porbandar only.

The court observed that the Gosabara Wetland is an important habitat for migratory birds and is recognized as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The court also noted that the wetland is protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and that any activity that causes harm to the wildlife in the area is prohibited.

The court heard arguments from the petitioner that fishing activity in the wetland was causing harm to the birds that visit the area. The petitioner argued that the fishing nets used by the fishermen were trapping and killing the birds. The state authorities argued that fishing was a traditional activity in the area and that it was the only source of livelihood for the people in the area.

The court noted that all licenses for fishing in the wetland had been cancelled and that no permanent ban had been imposed on fishing. The court also observed that the state authorities had taken steps to protect the wetland, including the appointment of a wetland officer and the formation of a wetland management committee.

The court restricted the case to the Gosabara Wetland at Porbandar only and directed the state authorities to take appropriate steps to protect the wetland. The court also directed the state authorities to file a compliance report within a specified time frame.

In the second court order, the court cancelled fishing licenses of fishermen who were granted permission to fish in the wetland where hunting of birds is also prohibited. The petitioner had requested that the wetland be declared a protected area under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, but the court cannot decide on the feasibility of this without satisfactory evidence.

Until a decision is made, fishing and hunting activities are prohibited, and the District Collector and Superintendent of Police must ensure that no such activities take place. The court has issued directions for the examination of the matter and appropriate decision-making within a specified time frame.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court has taken steps to protect the Gosabara Wetland in Porbandar under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has cancelled fishing licenses of fishermen who were granted permission to fish in the wetland where hunting of birds is also prohibited. The court has also directed the state authorities to take appropriate steps to protect the wetland and file a compliance report within a specified time frame. The court has restricted the case to the Gosabara Wetland at Porbandar only and has issued directions for the examination of the matter and appropriate decision-making within a specified time frame.
