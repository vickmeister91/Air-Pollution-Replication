The court order in question pertains to a case between Neemo Rani and the State of Punjab. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was dealt with by the ACJM, Ludhiana. The petitioner's lawyer had requested the withdrawal of the revision petition, and the prayer was allowed. The petition was subsequently dismissed as withdrawn. The order was passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa on 26th March 2015.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, it appears that the petitioner had sought the production of certain documents or things in relation to the proceedings.

The ACJM, Ludhiana, had presumably considered the petitioner's application and made a decision on whether or not to issue the summons or order sought. It is not clear from the available information what the decision was, or whether the petitioner was satisfied with it.

However, it is clear that at some point after the ACJM's decision, the petitioner's lawyer requested the withdrawal of the revision petition. It is not clear why the lawyer made this request, or what the implications of the withdrawal were for the petitioner's case.

In any event, the prayer for withdrawal was allowed, and the petition was dismissed as withdrawn. This means that the petitioner's case was effectively closed, and no further action could be taken on it.

The order was passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa, who is a judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. It is not clear from the available information whether the order was made in the context of an appeal or some other type of proceeding.

Overall, the available information about this court order is quite limited, and it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the case or its outcome. However, it appears that the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was dealt with by the ACJM, Ludhiana, and that the petitioner subsequently withdrew their revision petition. The order dismissing the petition as withdrawn was passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa on 26th March 2015.
