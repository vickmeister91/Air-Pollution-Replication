The court order pertains to a bail application filed by the petitioner, Hansa@hansram, under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner had been arrested in connection with an FIR registered against him for various offenses. The court considered the arguments presented by the petitioner's counsel and granted the bail application. The order states that the accused petitioner will be released on bail, subject to certain conditions.

The first condition for the petitioner's release on bail is that he must furnish a personal bond. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that he will appear before the court as and when required. The amount of the bond is usually determined by the court based on the seriousness of the offense and the financial status of the accused. The order does not specify the amount of the personal bond that the petitioner is required to furnish.

The second condition for the petitioner's release on bail is that he must provide two sureties. A surety is a person who undertakes to ensure that the accused will appear before the court as and when required. The sureties must be individuals who are financially sound and have a good reputation in society. The order does not specify the identity of the sureties that the petitioner is required to provide.

The order further states that the sureties must be approved by the learned trial court. The learned trial court is the court that will hear the case against the petitioner. The court will examine the sureties to ensure that they are suitable and reliable. The sureties will also be required to furnish a bond stating that they will ensure the petitioner's appearance before the court.

The order also specifies that the petitioner must comply with any other conditions that may be imposed by the learned trial court. This means that the court may impose additional conditions for the petitioner's release on bail, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case.

The order concludes by stating that the petitioner's release on bail is subject to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This means that the learned trial court has the discretion to refuse the petitioner's release on bail if it is not satisfied with the conditions imposed or if it believes that the petitioner is likely to abscond or interfere with the investigation.

In summary, the court order grants bail to the petitioner, Hansa@hansram, subject to the conditions that he furnishes a personal bond, provides two sureties approved by the learned trial court, and complies with any other conditions that may be imposed by the learned trial court. The order emphasizes that the petitioner's release on bail is subject to the satisfaction of the learned trial court, which has the discretion to refuse the petitioner's release on bail if it deems fit.
