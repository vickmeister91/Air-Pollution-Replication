The court order pertains to various appeals filed by United India Insurance Co. Ltd. against awards passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in different cases involving accidents. In the first case, the insurer claimed that the liability of satisfying the award had been erroneously fastened on them and challenged the award on quantum. The claimants also filed an appeal seeking enhancement of compensation. The court took note of the factual context of the case and the issues framed by the Tribunal. The insurer had taken a specific objection with regard to the maintainability of the claim petition against it, but the Tribunal did not frame this vital issue. The court noted the plea taken by the insurer and the owner of the offending vehicle and observed that they needed to be taken into consideration.

In the second case, the court discusses a situation where an insurance policy was cancelled due to the premium cheque being dishonoured by the bank. The accident occurred during the period when the insurance policy was valid, but the insurer claims that they cannot be held liable as the policy was cancelled. The claimants argue that the insurer cannot escape liability as it is imposed by the Motor Vehicles Act. The court examines relevant provisions of the Act and concludes that the insurer cannot avoid liability to satisfy the award for third party claims, even if the policy has been cancelled, but can only recover the amount from the insured.

The court order also discusses the requirements for a policy of insurance for motor vehicles used in public places. The policy must be issued by an authorized insurer and cover liability for death, injury, or property damage caused by the use of the vehicle. The insurer is liable to indemnify the insured in case of loss suffered by a third party. The order also mentions Section 149, which outlines the duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards against persons insured in respect of third party risks.

Section 149 of the Act, 1988, is further discussed in the court order. It states that once a certificate of insurance has been issued in favor of the person who has taken out the policy, the insurer is liable to discharge any liability towards a third party, even if the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel the policy. The liability is towards the insured, who becomes liable to pay compensation to the third party, and is in relation to the use of the vehicle owned by the insured. The court also notes that the insurer is not liable towards the vehicle's owner, who has taken out the insurance cover by paying the premium to the insurer. The court further discusses the liability of the insurer in a specific case where the insured was not the registered owner of the offending vehicle at the time of insurance, and the insurer had insured the wrong person. The court concludes that the insurer is not liable to indemnify the insured in such a case.

In another case, the court order states that the insurance company cannot be held liable for the lapse of the registered owner of a vehicle who failed to ensure that he was actually insured by the insurer. The insurance company is only liable to pay compensation to the third party if a certificate of insurance has been issued in favor of the person for whom the policy has been effected, even if the policy has been cancelled due to a breach committed by the insured. The court also states that the insurer cannot be called upon to indemnify the insured and pay compensation to the third party unless the insured is held liable to compensate the third party in legally constituted proceedings.

Finally, the court order allows an appeal for an enhancement of the awarded compensation in a separate case, modifying the amount to be paid to the claimants. The court also states that the insurance company cannot be held responsible for negligence in a case where the policy of insurance was taken out by the new owner of a vehicle in the name of the previous owner, who had already transferred ownership.

In summary, the court order discusses various aspects of insurance liability in cases involving motor accidents. It emphasizes the duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards against persons insured in respect of third party risks, even if the policy has been cancelled. The court also clarifies that the insurer is not liable towards the vehicle's owner, who has taken out the insurance cover by paying the premium to the insurer. The court further discusses the liability of the insurer in specific cases where the insured was not the registered owner of the offending vehicle at the time of insurance, and the insurer had insured the wrong person. The court also allows an appeal for an enhancement of the awarded compensation in a separate case, modifying the amount to be paid to the claimants.
