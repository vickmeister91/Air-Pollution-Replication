The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently passed an order in a writ petition filed by Gram Panchayat Majrian. The petition sought to restrain the State from extending the notification under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). The court, however, found the petition to be premature and based on mere apprehension.

The court referred to a prior occasion where it had given extensive directions to the State regarding the PLPA notification. The court had directed the State to ensure that the provisions of the PLPA were implemented in letter and spirit. The court had also directed the State to take necessary steps to ensure that the forest cover in the State was protected.

The court observed that the PLPA was enacted to protect the forest cover in the State and to prevent the degradation of the environment. The court noted that the PLPA had been in force for several decades and had been instrumental in protecting the forest cover in the State.

The court further observed that the PLPA notification had been extended from time to time in the past, and there had been no adverse impact on the environment. The court noted that the State had also taken several steps to protect the forest cover in the State, including the establishment of a State Forest Department and the creation of a Forest Conservation Fund.

The court emphasized that the mandate of law must be adhered to and respected. The court noted that the PLPA was a legislation enacted by the State Legislature and was binding on all concerned. The court observed that any violation of the PLPA would be dealt with strictly in accordance with law.

The court disposed of the present writ petition, but allowed the petitioner to approach the court if any notification was issued in violation of the directions given by the court. The court directed the State to ensure that the provisions of the PLPA were implemented in letter and spirit and that the forest cover in the State was protected.

In conclusion, the court order in the writ petition filed by Gram Panchayat Majrian highlights the importance of protecting the forest cover in the State of Punjab. The court has emphasized that the PLPA is a legislation enacted by the State Legislature and must be adhered to and respected. The court has also directed the State to take necessary steps to ensure that the provisions of the PLPA are implemented in letter and spirit and that the forest cover in the State is protected.
