The court order in question pertains to two petitions filed by Abdulgan Abdul Rahim Pocha against the State of Gujarat. The petitioner claimed that they were not issued royalty passes despite being given a mining lease, and that the lease had not been cancelled despite the area being declared forest land. The court found that once land is declared forest land, it cannot be leased out for mining activities, and therefore the petitioners were not entitled to any relief. The petitions were summarily dismissed, but the court stated that if the petitioners were entitled to any right under the law, they could apply to the respondent authorities.

The first petition filed by Abdulgan Abdul Rahim Pocha pertained to the issue of royalty passes. The petitioner claimed that despite being given a mining lease, they were not issued royalty passes. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Gujarat Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2017, and found that the issuance of royalty passes was mandatory under the rules. However, the court also noted that the petitioner had not made any representation to the respondent authorities regarding the non-issuance of royalty passes. The court therefore held that the petitioner had not exhausted the available remedies and dismissed the petition.

The second petition filed by Abdulgan Abdul Rahim Pocha pertained to the cancellation of the mining lease. The petitioner claimed that the lease had not been cancelled despite the area being declared forest land. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Gujarat Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003, and found that once land is declared forest land, it cannot be leased out for mining activities. The court therefore held that the mining lease granted to the petitioner was illegal and void ab initio. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any representation to the respondent authorities regarding the cancellation of the mining lease. The court therefore held that the petitioner had not exhausted the available remedies and dismissed the petition.

In both petitions, the court noted that the petitioner had not made any representation to the respondent authorities regarding the issues raised in the petitions. The court emphasized that the petitioner should have first exhausted the available remedies before approaching the court. The court also stated that if the petitioners were entitled to any right under the law, they could apply to the respondent authorities.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two petitions filed by Abdulgan Abdul Rahim Pocha against the State of Gujarat. The court found that once land is declared forest land, it cannot be leased out for mining activities, and therefore the petitioners were not entitled to any relief. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any representation to the respondent authorities regarding the issues raised in the petitions and therefore had not exhausted the available remedies. The court dismissed both petitions but stated that if the petitioners were entitled to any right under the law, they could apply to the respondent authorities.
