The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case where a religious organization claimed that they should be allowed to use microphones and loudspeakers during religious activities without interference from authorities. The court acknowledged that the right to propagate religion is guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution, but it is subject to restrictions under Article 19(1)(a) which guarantees the freedom of speech and expression. The court held that the use of microphones and loudspeakers should be limited to the followers present and should not cause annoyance or injury to the public or affect their fundamental rights.

The court recognized that the use of microphones and loudspeakers can cause noise pollution and affect public health. Therefore, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board should maintain noise level registers and indicate the level of noise permitted by the use of microphones. The court also stated that the person or business dealing with microphones and loudspeakers should seal the volume and noise level according to the directions of the Pollution Control Board. This will ensure that the use of microphones and loudspeakers does not exceed the permissible noise levels and cause harm to the public.

The court order imposes restrictions on the use of loudspeakers in West Bengal. Loudspeakers are not allowed to operate in the streets between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. except for certain authorized purposes. The volume and noise level of loudspeakers should be approved by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and enforced by the police and administration. Before granting permission for the use of loudspeakers, the police must inspect and seal the noise level. This will ensure that the use of loudspeakers does not exceed the permissible noise levels and cause harm to the public.

The court order emphasizes the importance of preserving public health and protecting citizens' fundamental rights. The court recognized that the use of microphones and loudspeakers can cause annoyance and injury to the public and affect their fundamental rights.
