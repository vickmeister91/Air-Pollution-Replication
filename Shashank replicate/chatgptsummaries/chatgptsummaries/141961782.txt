The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Niku Khan @ Mohammed Deen, seeking to quash an order passed by the learned Special Judge, NDPS Act Cases, Hanumangarh. The petitioner had earlier filed a complaint against police personnel, and in response to this complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against the petitioner and his wife, falsely implicating them in a crime.

The petitioner's primary prayer in the petition was that the call-details of the concerned police personnel be provided to him under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.). The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to summon the call and location details of the mobile phones of the police personnel for the relevant period.

The court's decision to allow the petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had made a prima facie case for the disclosure of the call-details of the police personnel. The court noted that the petitioner had alleged that the FIR was lodged against him and his wife in retaliation for the complaint he had filed against the police personnel. The court also observed that the petitioner had provided some evidence to support his claim, such as the fact that the FIR was lodged after a considerable delay and that the police had not conducted any investigation into the complaint filed by the petitioner.

In light of these facts, the court held that the call-details of the police personnel were relevant to the case and that the petitioner had a right to access this information under Section 91 of the Cr. P.C. The court also noted that the disclosure of this information would not prejudice the investigation or trial of the case in any way.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. By allowing the petitioner access to the call-details of the police personnel, the court has ensured that the investigation and trial of the case will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.

Furthermore, the court's decision also highlights the need for police personnel to act in accordance with the law and to refrain from using their power to settle personal scores or to intimidate individuals who file complaints against them. The court's decision sends a strong message to law enforcement agencies that they will be held accountable for their actions and that they must act in accordance with the law at all times.

In conclusion, the court's decision to allow the petitioner access to the call-details of the police personnel is a significant step towards ensuring transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. The decision reaffirms the importance of the rule of law and sends a strong message to law enforcement agencies that they must act in accordance with the law at all times.
