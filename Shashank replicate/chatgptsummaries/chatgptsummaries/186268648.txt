The court recently dismissed a third bail application by Kalla, also known as Lakhan Singh, who has been in jail since 2013. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which had not yet been decided. The court directed the Registry to write a letter to the Superintendent of Police and Investigating Officer to produce the case-diary and witnesses before the trial court. The trial court was directed to decide the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. within a month.

Kalla had been seeking bail for the third time, but the court denied his request. He had been in jail for several years, and his application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. had not yet been decided. The court directed the Registry to write a letter to the Superintendent of Police and Investigating Officer to produce the case-diary and witnesses before the trial court. This was done to ensure that the trial court had all the necessary information to make a decision on Kalla's application.

The court's decision to dismiss Kalla's bail application was based on several factors. First, Kalla had already been denied bail twice before, and the court did not see any reason to grant him bail this time. Second, Kalla had been in jail for a long time, and the court felt that he should remain in custody until his trial was completed. Finally, the court wanted to ensure that the trial court had all the necessary information to make a decision on Kalla's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to direct the Registry to write a letter to the Superintendent of Police and Investigating Officer was an important one. This was done to ensure that the trial court had all the necessary information to make a decision on Kalla's application. The case-diary and witnesses were important pieces of evidence that the trial court needed to consider before making a decision on Kalla's application.

The court also directed the trial court to decide Kalla's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. within a month. This was done to ensure that Kalla's application was decided in a timely manner. The court recognized that Kalla had been in jail for a long time, and it wanted to ensure that his application was decided as soon as possible.

In conclusion, the court recently dismissed Kalla's third bail application and directed the Registry to write a letter to the Superintendent of Police and Investigating Officer to produce the case-diary and witnesses before the trial court. The trial court was directed to decide Kalla's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. within a month. The court's decision was based on several factors, including Kalla's previous bail applications, the length of time he had been in jail, and the need for the trial court to have all the necessary information to make a decision on his application.
