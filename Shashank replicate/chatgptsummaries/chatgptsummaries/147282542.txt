The court order pertains to a case involving the transportation and smuggling of red crowned roof turtles, which are on the verge of extinction and are found only in the ecosystem of river Chambal. Thameem Ansari filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings of Criminal Case No.1648/2017 pending before Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sagar, arising out of a complaint filed by the Deputy Conservator of Forest and In-Charge of Regional Tiger Strike Force Sagar (M.P.) in connection with P.O.R.No.28060/02 registered at Forest Department, Tiger Reserve Force, Sagar under Section 2, 9, 39, 44, 48A, 49B, 51, 52 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The applicant, Thameem Ansari, was arrested in connection with the case and disclosed that he had purchased 450 turtles of three different varieties, including expensive red crowned roof turtles, for a sum of Rs.3 lacs. The case also involves the seizure of 2500 live turtles from the house of his agent Venkatesh. The applicant has filed the petition against the filing of supplementary complaint and the cognizance taken by the learned CJM, Sagar on that complaint against him.

The court found that the complaint against Ansari was not maintainable as there is no provision for filing a supplementary complaint to add a new accused. The court also found that the complaint was filed by an unauthorized person and there was no evidence connecting Ansari to the crime. The court quashed the proceedings against Ansari in the case.

The court also discussed the admissibility of a supplementary complaint filed against an individual accused of smuggling red crowned roof turtles. The court determined that if an allegation against a person is mentioned in a complaint, they will be deemed an accused of that complaint, regardless of whether their name is mentioned in the cause title. The court also noted that the doctrine of double jeopardy does not protect a person from being tried and punished twice for different offenses arising from the same set of facts.

The court emphasized that if the offenses are distinct, the ban on double punishment cannot be invoked. The case cited involves a person charged with offenses under both the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Indian Penal Code for killing an elephant and removing its tusks. The court held that the offenses were distinct and the accused could be charged under both laws. The current case involves the illegal keeping and transportation of Indian Star Tortoise and Red Crowned Roof Turtles, and the court holds that the charges under the Wildlife Protection Act are distinct from those under the Custom Act, and the accused can be charged under both.

The court also discussed the applicability of certain judgments in a case where two different agencies registered cases against the accused for two different Acts. The court explained that when a complaint is filed by a public servant acting in discharge of their official duties, it is not obligatory for the Magistrate to inquire into the case before summoning the accused residing beyond their jurisdiction. The court also cited relevant provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Madhya Pradesh Rules of 1974 to establish the authority of the Deputy Conservator of Forest to file a complaint and make investigations into offenses against the Act.

The court order states that a complaint has been filed under Section 55 of the Act and the complainant is authorized to file the complaint. The applicant has admitted to being involved in smuggling of red crowned roof turtle and purchased it from a co-accused. The court has dismissed the petition filed by the applicant and allowed him to raise objections at an appropriate stage during the trial. The case is pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sagar and the applicant has the opportunity to cross-examine the complainant during before charge evidence.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case involving the transportation and smuggling of red crowned roof turtles, which are on the verge of extinction and are found only in the ecosystem of river Chambal.
