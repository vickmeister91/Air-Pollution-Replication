The court order pertains to two separate cases where the applicants had raised grievances against the charge sheet and summoning order passed against them under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. In the first case, Abhimanyu Singh had been accused of accumulating more wealth than his known sources of income. Singh had filed an application to quash the charge sheet and summoning order passed against him in Criminal Case No. 36 of 2005. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined the evidence presented.

Singh had argued that the charge sheet was filed against him without proper sanction for prosecution. However, the court rejected his argument and concluded that he had disproportionate and unexplained expenditure. The court found that Singh had failed to explain the source of his income and had accumulated wealth beyond his known sources of income. Therefore, the court dismissed Singh's application to quash the charge sheet and summoning order passed against him.

In the second case, the applicant had been accused of having disproportionate and unexplained expenditure. The investigating officer had calculated the expenditure at the rate of 50% of the total income, which was contrary to the directions and guidelines given in the Vigilance Manual. The applicant had raised a grievance that the investigating officer had committed gross illegality and irregularity in calculating his income.

The court examined the evidence presented and found that the investigating officer had indeed wrongly calculated the maturity amount of FDR. The court also found that the investigating officer had calculated the expenditure at the rate of 50% of the total income, which was contrary to the directions and guidelines given in the Vigilance Manual. Therefore, the court allowed the application and quashed the charge sheet and summoning order passed against the applicant.

In both cases, the court had examined the evidence presented and had come to a conclusion based on the facts of the case. In the first case, the court had found that Singh had disproportionate and unexplained expenditure, while in the second case, the court had found that the investigating officer had committed gross illegality and irregularity in calculating the applicant's income. The court had also found that the investigating officer had wrongly calculated the maturity amount of FDR.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of following proper procedures and guidelines while investigating cases of corruption. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to explain the source of their income and to avoid accumulating wealth beyond their known sources of income. The court's decision serves as a reminder that corruption is a serious offense and that those found guilty of it will be held accountable for their actions.
