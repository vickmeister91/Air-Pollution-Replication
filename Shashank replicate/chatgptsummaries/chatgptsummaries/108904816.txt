One court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity, and the petitioners seek the quashing of the demand notice, a refund of the NPV deposited, and other appropriate orders. The court summarizes the facts of the case, including the policy letter dated 07.02.2000, the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on 01.04.2015, and the demand notice issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Udaipur on 17.10.2017. The court notes that the controversy is common to all the writ petitions and decides to hear them together.

Another court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the compensation amount, while the rest either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they were being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and for the common area, which is being utilized by the cluster members. The respondents argued that the status of the cluster had changed since the diversion and that some lease holders were not interested in extending the validity period of the diversion. The court considered various documents and submissions from both sides before reserving its judgment.

In another court order, the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, and approval was given for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs.17,59,06,000/- for the extension of the period of diversion proposal. Out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court has decided that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders in the cluster shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare, and after such division, the share of each mining lease holder as per one hectare shall be paid by him, inclusive his individual lease NPV.

In conclusion, the court orders mentioned in the summaries pertain to various disputes related to mining leases and forest clearances in the State of Rajasthan. The court has considered various submissions and documents from both sides before reserving its judgment in some cases, while in others, it has directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for the mining lease holders individually and divide the common area equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare. However, specific details about the content of the petitions and the court's ruling are not provided in some of the summaries.
