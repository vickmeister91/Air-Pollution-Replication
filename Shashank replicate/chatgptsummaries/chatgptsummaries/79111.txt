The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Sunita Tiwari against the State of U.P. and others, challenging the validity of an order passed by the Additional District Magistrate. The petitioner's husband had died in a fatal accident caused by a broken high tension electric wire, and she had filed an application under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991, which was dismissed as not maintainable. The petitioner's counsel argued that the view taken by the authority concerned was incorrect and in contravention of a previous judgment. The court referred to the previous judgment and held that electricity is a hazardous substance and that the accident caused by it is covered under the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The court allowed the writ petition.

The court order states that electricity is considered a hazardous substance under Section 2(d) of the Act of 1991 and does not need to be specified in a notification by the Central Government to be considered hazardous. The court cites previous cases that have established this interpretation. The court also notes that Section 3(2) of the Act imposes strict liability without fault in case of accidents involving hazardous substances, and that the lack of a policy by the electricity board does not absolve them of liability. The court quashes an order that had deemed an application under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 as not maintainable and orders it to be decided afresh within six months.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the liability of electricity boards in cases of accidents caused by broken electric wires. The court has held that electricity is a hazardous substance and that accidents caused by it are covered under the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. This means that victims of such accidents can claim compensation under the Act. The court has also held that the lack of a policy by the electricity board does not absolve them of liability. This means that electricity boards cannot escape liability by claiming that they did not have a policy in place.

The court's decision is based on a careful interpretation of the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The Act imposes strict liability without fault in case of accidents involving hazardous substances. This means that the person or entity responsible for the hazardous substance is liable to pay compensation to the victims of the accident, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. The court has held that electricity is a hazardous substance under the Act and that accidents caused by it are covered under the Act.

The court's decision is also based on previous judgments that have established the interpretation that electricity is a hazardous substance. The court has cited these judgments in support of its decision. This shows that the court's decision is not based on a novel interpretation of the law but is in line with previous judgments.

The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the liability of electricity boards in cases of accidents caused by broken electric wires. The court has clarified that electricity is a hazardous substance and that accidents caused by it are covered under the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991.
