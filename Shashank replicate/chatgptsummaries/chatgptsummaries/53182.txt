In a recent court order, the issue at hand was a plaintiff's suit seeking a permanent injunction against the defendant from letting out noxious fluids into a river. The defendant had objected to the suit's maintainability under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The trial court had upheld the objection, but the appellate court disagreed and remanded the matter for inquiry. The defendant then filed a revision petition against the appellate court's order.

The crux of the matter was whether Section 58 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 prohibited the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain a suit or proceeding restraining the defendant from causing pollution. The defendant argued that the Act provided for a specific mechanism for dealing with pollution-related issues, and therefore, the civil court had no jurisdiction in the matter.

However, the court held that the appellate court's interpretation was correct and that Section 58 of the Act did not prohibit the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain a suit or proceeding restraining the defendant from causing pollution. The court noted that the Act did not provide an exclusive remedy for pollution-related issues and that the civil court's jurisdiction was not ousted by the Act.

The court further observed that the Act provided for the establishment of pollution control boards and the delegation of powers to them. However, this did not mean that the civil court's jurisdiction was ousted. The court held that the pollution control boards and the civil court had concurrent jurisdiction in matters related to pollution.

The court also noted that the Act provided for the imposition of penalties for causing pollution. However, this did not mean that the civil court's jurisdiction was ousted. The court held that the imposition of penalties was a separate issue and did not affect the civil court's jurisdiction to entertain a suit or proceeding restraining the defendant from causing pollution.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the defendant's revision petition and upheld the appellate court's order. The court's order is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters related to pollution and reinforces the importance of protecting the environment. The court's order also highlights the need for a coordinated approach between pollution control boards and civil courts in dealing with pollution-related issues.
