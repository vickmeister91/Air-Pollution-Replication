The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Shatish Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court order directs the State to take steps to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of distributories and canals. The State and local authorities are directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. Compliance reports regarding publication of notices and action taken for enforcement of the direction imposing the compensation or damages are to be placed before the court. The court also directs the removal of encroachments within one month and the payment of compensation of Rs. 25,000/- by persons contributing to pollution. The State is directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure.

The court has ordered the removal of existing structures in an area meant for maintenance of a canal as they are causing contamination of the canal water. The state has been directed to remove these structures and file a compliance report. The court has also ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court has directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court has suggested that the persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has already ordered that any person resisting the action of the State Authorities be directed to present before the NGT.

The Supreme Court of India has dismissed a writ petition seeking to challenge the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to hear a case related to environmental pollution caused by a factory. The court held that the NGT has ample power to condone the delay in filing the application and that the petitioner should exhaust all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by 31st December 2016.

The court has ordered that any application or representation related to the case must be filed by December 31, 2016. Until then, the state authorities are not allowed to take any action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone any delay in filing the application/representation and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed according to further orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition has been disposed of.

In summary, the court orders pertain to cases related to environmental pollution caused by factories and untreated effluent discharge into canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The NGT has directed the state to take effective measures to prevent pollution and provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court has ordered the removal of encroachments and structures causing contamination of canal water and the imposition of damages or compensation on persons found contaminating distributory or canal water. The court has also directed the state to prepare a comprehensive scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for the removal of encroachments. The Supreme Court has dismissed a writ petition challenging the jurisdiction of the NGT and has ordered that any application or representation related to the case must be filed by December 31, 2016.
