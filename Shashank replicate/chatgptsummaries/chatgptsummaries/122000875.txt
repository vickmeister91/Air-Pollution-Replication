In a recent court order, an application submitted by the applicants under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. read with section 207 was rejected by the court. The reason for the rejection was that the accused persons were prolonging the trial at the stage of final judgement. The court found no illegality or infirmity with the order impugned so as to warrant interference in this revision.

The court also vacated the stay order that was passed on 14/10/2014. The trial court was directed to hear the final arguments and pronounce the judgement in accordance with law before 30th June, 2015.

The court's decision to reject the application was based on the fact that the accused persons were prolonging the trial at the stage of final judgement. This is a common tactic used by defendants in criminal cases to delay the proceedings and avoid a verdict. However, the court found no merit in the defendants' arguments and decided to proceed with the trial.

The court's decision to vacate the stay order was also significant. A stay order is a court order that temporarily suspends the proceedings in a case. In this case, the stay order was preventing the trial court from hearing the final arguments and pronouncing the judgement. By vacating the stay order, the court allowed the trial court to proceed with the case and reach a verdict.

Overall, the court's decision was a significant step towards ensuring that justice is served in this case. By rejecting the defendants' attempts to prolong the trial and vacating the stay order, the court has cleared the way for the trial court to reach a verdict. This is an important development in the case and will hopefully lead to a just outcome for all parties involved.
