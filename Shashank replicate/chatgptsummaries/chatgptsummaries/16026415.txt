The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Pushkar against the State of Rajasthan seeking the quashing of FIR No. 384/2014 registered at Police Station Bayana District Bharatpur for the offence under Section 33, 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petition is covered by a previous decision given by the court in SB Cr.Misc. Petition No. 2002/2015 titled as Mousam Khan Vs. State of Raj. & Anr.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, allowed the petition and quashed the FIR and all subsequent proceedings arising from it. However, the court granted the complainant the liberty to file a complaint with regard to the alleged offence if so advised.

The Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is an act to consolidate and amend the law relating to forests, the transit of forest-produce and the duty leviable on timber and other forest-produce in Rajasthan. The act provides for the protection, conservation, and management of forests and wildlife in the state.

Section 33 of the act deals with the prohibition of certain acts in reserved forests, protected forests, and unclassed forests. It prohibits the cutting, uprooting, damaging, or destroying of any tree or timber, or the collection, removal, or damage of any forest produce, without the permission of the forest officer.

Section 41 of the act deals with the power of the forest officer to arrest without warrant. It empowers the forest officer to arrest without a warrant any person who commits an offence under the act or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed or is about to commit an offence.

Section 42 of the act deals with the power of the forest officer to search without warrant. It empowers the forest officer to search without a warrant any person, vehicle, vessel, or receptacle, if he has reason to believe that any forest produce in respect of which an offence has been committed or is about to be committed is concealed therein.

In the present case, the petitioner had challenged the FIR registered against him under these sections of the act. The court, after considering the arguments of the petitioner's counsel, quashed the FIR and all subsequent proceedings arising from it.

The court relied on a previous decision given by the court in SB Cr.Misc. Petition No. 2002/2015 titled as Mousam Khan Vs. State of Raj. & Anr. In that case, the court had quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner under similar sections of the act.

The court observed that the present case is covered by the previous decision given by the court in Mousam Khan's case. The court held that the FIR registered against the petitioner is liable to be quashed on the same grounds as in Mousam Khan's case.

The court further observed that the complainant is at liberty to file a complaint with regard to the alleged offence if so advised. This means that the complainant can file a fresh complaint against the petitioner for the alleged offence under the act.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Pushkar against the State of Rajasthan seeking the quashing of FIR No. 384/2014 registered at Police Station Bayana District Bharatpur for the offence under Section 33, 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The court allowed the petition and quashed the FIR and all subsequent proceedings arising from it, but granted the complainant the liberty to file a complaint with regard to the alleged offence if so advised. The court relied on a previous decision given by the court in SB Cr.Misc. Petition No. 2002/2015 titled as Mousam Khan Vs. State of Raj. & Anr. and held that the present case is covered by the previous decision given by the court in Mousam Khan's case.
