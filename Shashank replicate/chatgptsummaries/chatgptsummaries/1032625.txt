The case at hand involves a Senior Environmental Engineer who is a Member Secretary under the Board. The petitioner has challenged the legality and validity of a communication issued by the Government of Assam in the Environment and Forests Department. The communication directed the petitioner to hand over charge of Member Secretary to the senior-most Officer/Engineer on his superannuation with effect from 28.2.2007. The issue calls for determination of whether the Government in the Environment and Forest Department is authorized to issue the impugned letter asking the petitioner to act in a particular way on the ground of attaining the age of superannuation with effect from 28.2.2007.

The court found that the Board is fully aware that it is the creation of the State and the Board has been provided with financial aid. Therefore, the Government has control over the Board. The court order discusses the control that the Government of Assam has over the Board, particularly in matters such as borrowing powers, budget, leave, appointment of staff, and creation of posts. The court concludes that the Board cannot act independently without the approval of the State Government. Therefore, the issue of raising the age of superannuation for Board employees cannot be taken unilaterally.

The writ petition filed by the petitioner is dismissed, and the petitioner is directed to carry out the communication dated 26.2.2007. The court order highlights the importance of the State Government's control over the Board and its employees. The Board cannot act independently without the approval of the State Government. The court order also emphasizes the need for the Board to follow the rules and regulations set by the State Government.

In conclusion, the court order emphasizes the importance of the State Government's control over the Board and its employees.
