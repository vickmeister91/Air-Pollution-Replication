Roop Kishore had appealed against his conviction and fine for violating the Motor Vehicle Act by stopping a bus at an undesignated spot. He argued that the challan was prepared illegally and that the police officer who prepared it was not authorized to do so. However, the court found that the trial court had legally and reasonably dealt with all the pleas taken by the appellant and that there was no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment. The court also held that the absence of any independent witness did not affect the veracity of the prosecution case.

The court order states that there is no legal requirement for public persons to be joined as witnesses in traffic challans if the evidence of police officials is reliable. The court also notes that a vehicle can be impounded for violations other than permit violations, and that the decision of a Constitution Bench in M.C. Mehta's case must be followed over the decision of a Division Bench in Nanded Prabhani's case. The appeal filed by the appellant is dismissed, and the trial court record is to be sent back.

The case of Roop Kishore is an interesting one as it highlights the importance of following traffic rules and regulations. Roop Kishore was convicted and fined for violating the Motor Vehicle Act by stopping a bus at an undesignated spot. He argued that the challan was prepared illegally and that the police officer who prepared it was not authorized to do so. However, the court found that the trial court had legally and reasonably dealt with all the pleas taken by the appellant and that there was no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment. This means that Roop Kishore's conviction and fine were justified.

The court also held that the absence of any independent witness did not affect the veracity of the prosecution case. This is an important point as it shows that the evidence of police officials can be relied upon even if there are no independent witnesses. This is because police officials are trained to handle such situations and their evidence can be considered reliable.

The court order also states that a vehicle can be impounded for violations other than permit violations. This means that if a vehicle is found to be violating any other traffic rules and regulations, it can be impounded. This is an important point as it shows that the law is strict when it comes to traffic violations.

The court also noted that the decision of a Constitution Bench in M.C. Mehta's case must be followed over the decision of a Division Bench in Nanded Prabhani's case. This means that the decision of the Constitution Bench is more important and must be followed even if there is a conflicting decision by a Division Bench. This is an important point as it shows that the decisions of higher courts must be followed even if there are conflicting decisions by lower courts.

In conclusion, the case of Roop Kishore highlights the importance of following traffic rules and regulations. The court found that his conviction and fine were justified and that the evidence of police officials can be relied upon even if there are no independent witnesses.
