The court order in question pertains to a dispute over jurisdiction in a civil suit filed by Madan Lal against a firm and its partners. The plaintiff claimed jurisdiction of the Ferozepore Courts under the Displaced Persons Ordinance, but the Subordinate Judge found that the plaintiff was not a resident of the Ferozepore District and returned the plaint for presentation to the proper court. The plaintiff did not file an appeal against this order, and instead presented the plaint in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, first class, Fazilka.

The contesting defendants objected to this on the grounds that the question of jurisdiction had already been decided by the Subordinate Judge, first class, Ferozepore. The Subordinate Judge, Fazilka, held that he had jurisdiction to try the suit, but the defendant filed a revision application against this decision. The court held that the decision of the Subordinate Judge, first class, Ferozepore, was final and that the Subordinate Judge, Fazilka, had no jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.

The court made the rule absolute and ordered that the parties bear their own costs. This ruling highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and respecting the decisions of the court. It also emphasizes the need for clear and consistent guidelines regarding jurisdiction in civil suits.

The Displaced Persons Ordinance, which the plaintiff had cited as the basis for his claim of jurisdiction in the Ferozepore Courts, was enacted in 1948 to provide relief and rehabilitation to persons who had been displaced from their homes and properties during the partition of India. The ordinance established special courts to hear disputes related to the resettlement of displaced persons, and gave these courts exclusive jurisdiction over such matters.

However, the ordinance also contained provisions allowing for the transfer of cases from one court to another if the court in which the case was originally filed did not have jurisdiction. In this case, the Subordinate Judge had determined that the plaintiff was not a resident of the Ferozepore District, and therefore did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.

The plaintiff's decision to present the plaint in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, first class, Fazilka, rather than filing an appeal against the Subordinate Judge's decision, was a risky move. It ultimately proved unsuccessful, as the court held that the decision of the Subordinate Judge, first class, Ferozepore, was final and that the Subordinate Judge, Fazilka, had no jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.

This ruling underscores the importance of following proper legal procedures and respecting the decisions of the court. It also highlights the need for clear and consistent guidelines regarding jurisdiction in civil suits, particularly in cases involving displaced persons and other vulnerable populations.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to established legal procedures and respecting the decisions of the court. It also underscores the need for clear and consistent guidelines regarding jurisdiction in civil suits, particularly in cases involving vulnerable populations such as displaced persons.
