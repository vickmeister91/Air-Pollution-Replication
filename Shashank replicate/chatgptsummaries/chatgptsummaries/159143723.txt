The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/S. Sai Krupa Dhanalaxmi Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other authorities. The petitioner had sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit. 

The court found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and allowed the operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court also referred to a similar case and followed the decision of the Division Bench in that case. The closure notice was quashed, and there was no order as to costs.

The petitioner had contended that the closure notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity of being heard. The petitioner had also submitted that the closure notice was issued on the basis of a report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner, which was not in accordance with the law. The petitioner had further submitted that the closure notice was issued on the ground that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent to operate the crushing unit, which was not correct.

The court observed that the petitioner was a valid licensee and had obtained the necessary consent to operate the crushing unit. The court also observed that the closure notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity of being heard, which was in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court further observed that the report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner was not in accordance with the law and that the closure notice was issued on the ground that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent to operate the crushing unit, which was not correct.

The court referred to a similar case and followed the decision of the Division Bench in that case. In that case, the court had held that the closure notice cannot be issued without giving an opportunity of being heard to the person concerned. The court had also held that the report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner should be in accordance with the law and that the closure notice cannot be issued on the ground that the necessary consent has not been obtained.

The court, therefore, quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and allowed the operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court also did not pass any order as to costs.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's recent judgment in the writ petition filed by M/S. Sai Krupa Dhanalaxmi Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other authorities is a significant one. The court's decision to quash the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and allow the operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order is a welcome relief for the petitioner. The court's observation that the closure notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity of being heard, which was in violation of the principles of natural justice, is a reminder to the authorities to follow the due process of law. The court's decision to follow the decision of the Division Bench in a similar case is a reaffirmation of the importance of consistency in judicial decisions.
