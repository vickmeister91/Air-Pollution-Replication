The Supreme Court of India has recently issued a series of orders related to the appointment of officials to State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The court has emphasized the importance of professionalism and technical expertise in these appointments, and has directed state governments to make appointments with due care and consideration.

One of the court orders set aside a decision by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to direct state governments to reconsider appointments to SPCBs and to lay down guidelines for such appointments. The court noted that while the NGT had highlighted the importance of ensuring that SPCB members had the necessary expertise and qualifications, it had exceeded its jurisdiction in making such directions. The court emphasized the importance of protecting and preserving the environment and the need for state governments to make appointments to SPCBs with due care and consideration.

Another court order discussed the importance of professionalism in SPCBs and the need for qualified individuals to be appointed as members and secretaries. The court cited letters from the Ministry of Environment and Forests encouraging the appointment of academicians, professionals, experts, and technologists to the SPCBs. The court noted that despite these recommendations, some SPCBs continue to make appointments without due consideration to the required qualifications. The court also cited a decision of the Jharkhand High Court which highlights the need for appropriate appointments to the SPCBs.

A third court order concerned the appointment of Thakur Bal Mukund Nath Shahdeo as the Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) in 2002. The court found that Shahdeo did not possess the qualifications required for the position and ordered his appointment to be quashed. Despite this decision, the State Governments continued to make unprofessional appointments to the SPCBs, leading to a communication from the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2005 urging the proper constitution of the SPCBs and Pollution Control Committees.

The court has also emphasized the need for technical qualifications and experience in environmental protection for the Chairperson, Member Secretary, and Members of Pollution Control Boards (PCBs). The court has noted that many non-technical and politically motivated individuals have been appointed to these positions, leading to ineffective functioning of PCBs. The court has cited recommendations from the MGK Menon Committee and various studies that emphasize the need for technically qualified professionals to be appointed to these positions. The Supreme Court Monitoring Committee (SCMC) has requested information from State/Union Territory governments regarding the qualifications of PCB members and will take necessary action based on the information provided. The court has urged State Governments to appoint technically qualified professionals to these positions to ensure effective functioning of PCBs.

The court has also discussed the nonchalance shown by the State Governments in appointing professionals and experts to the SPCBs to preserve and protect the environment. The NGT examined the expertise and qualifications of members of the SPCBs of almost all states and found that about ten states and one Union Territory had members who lacked the qualifications suggested by the Central Government. The NGT directed the State Governments to reconsider the appointment of the Chairperson and members of the SPCBs and laid down guidelines for their appointment. The appellants objected to the exercise of jurisdiction by the NGT in directing the State Governments to reconsider the appointment of the Chairperson and members of the SPCBs and laying down guidelines for their appointment. The court referred to relevant sections of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 to address this objection.

The court has also discussed the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in relation to disputes regarding the appointment of officials to State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The court concludes that the NGT does not have jurisdiction over such disputes, as they do not relate to a substantial question relating to the environment. The court suggests that the appointment of officials to SPCBs should be made based on guidelines and parameters set by the executive, and that competent, honest, independent persons of outstanding ability and high reputation should be appointed. The court also refers to recommendations made by various committees regarding the structural organization and functioning of SPCBs.

Finally, the court has directed the Executive in all states to frame appropriate guidelines or recruitment rules within six months to ensure that suitable professionals and experts are appointed to the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The order cites various committees and authorities that have recommended the appointment of qualified and impartial individuals to the SPCBs. The court warns that unless corrective measures are taken, petitions may be filed against the state for the issuance of a writ of quo warranto in respect of the appointment of the Chairperson and members of the SPCBs.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of professionalism and technical expertise in the appointment of officials to State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The court has directed state governments to make appointments with due care and consideration, and has warned that corrective measures must be taken to ensure that qualified and impartial individuals are appointed to these positions.
