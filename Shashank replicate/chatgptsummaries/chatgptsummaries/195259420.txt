In a recent court case, Sandeep Gupta's application under Section 91 of the CrPC was rejected by the court. The application was in relation to a complaint filed by Rakesh Chajed, which had already been rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge. The court found no jurisdictional error in the previous order and dismissed Gupta's petition under Section 482 of the CrPC.

Section 91 of the CrPC allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other material that may be necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Gupta had filed an application under this section, seeking the production of certain documents in relation to Chajed's complaint.

Chajed's complaint had alleged that Gupta had committed certain offences under the Indian Penal Code, including cheating and criminal breach of trust. The complaint had been filed before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, who had rejected it on the grounds that it was a civil dispute and not a criminal offence.

Gupta had then filed an application under Section 91 of the CrPC before the Additional Sessions Judge, seeking the production of certain documents to support his defence. However, this application was also rejected by the judge.

Gupta then approached the court, challenging the rejection of his application under Section 91 of the CrPC. He argued that the documents he had sought were necessary for his defence and that the rejection of his application had caused him prejudice.

However, the court found no merit in Gupta's arguments and dismissed his petition under Section 482 of the CrPC. The court held that there was no jurisdictional error in the impugned order and that Gupta had failed to make out a case for interference by the court.

Section 482 of the CrPC empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. However, the court can only exercise these powers in exceptional cases where there is a clear case of abuse of process or miscarriage of justice.

In this case, the court found that there was no abuse of process or miscarriage of justice and that the rejection of Gupta's application under Section 91 of the CrPC was justified. The court held that Gupta had failed to show that the documents he had sought were necessary for his defence and that the rejection of his application had caused him any prejudice.

In conclusion, the court rejected Sandeep Gupta's application under Section 91 of the CrPC in relation to a complaint filed by Rakesh Chajed. The court found no jurisdictional error in the previous order and dismissed Gupta's petition under Section 482 of the CrPC. The court held that there was no abuse of process or miscarriage of justice and that the rejection of Gupta's application was justified.
