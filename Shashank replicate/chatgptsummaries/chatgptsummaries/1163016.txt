The Standard Chartered Bank Pensioner's Association filed a writ petition claiming that the bank was not providing pension benefits to its retired employees as per the industry-wise settlement made by 58 banks and their workmen on 29th October 1993. The bank had issued a notice to retired employees asking them to opt for the industry-wise pension scheme or continue with the prevailing scheme of the bank. The retired employees at Kolkata opted for the industry-wise settlement, but the bank later withdrew the option. 

The Reserve Bank of India was directed to consider the representation made by the petitioners and dispose of the same within four months. However, the court dismissed the writ petition as private companies are normally not amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court order states that private companies may not be subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, except in cases where there are statutory provisions that they must comply with. 

The petitioners in this case were seeking enforcement of a contractual settlement, which cannot be done through a writ petition. The court suggests that the petitioners can file a civil suit instead. The court also notes that the observations made in previous cases do not apply to the current case, and that the writ petition is not maintainable. The appeal is dismissed, and there will be no order as to costs.
