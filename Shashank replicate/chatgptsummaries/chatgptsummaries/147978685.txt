The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to criminal cases involving allegations of corruption and illegal gratification. In the first case, the prosecution appealed against the acquittal of the respondent who was accused of demanding a bribe for a land mutation entry. The prosecution argued that the evidence of demand and acceptance was established and that the procedural safeguards were followed. However, the defense argued that the mutation entry was already made prior to the alleged demand and acceptance, and therefore, there was no question of illegal gratification. The court has yet to make a decision in this case.

The second court order discusses a case where the prosecution accused the defendant of demanding and accepting illegal gratification. The defendant argued that the prosecution failed to prove that the recovered amount was for a corrupt act. The court referred to various legal precedents and concluded that the prosecution failed to prove that the defendant demanded illegal gratification. The court also discussed the legal definition of criminal misconduct by a public servant and found that the prosecution failed to prove this charge as well.

In the third court order, the accused was not found guilty of criminal misconduct as there was no demand for illegal gratification and no evidence to prove it. The burden of proof was on the prosecution, but they could not prove their case. The court cites previous cases where the mere recovery of tainted money is not enough to convict the accused without evidence of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification. The court upholds the trial court's decision to acquit the accused.

The fourth court order states that an appellate court has the power to review the evidence in an appeal against acquittal and come to its own conclusion. The court should consider all matters on record and express the reasons for its decision. In this case, the appeal has been dismissed, and the judgment and order of the trial court have been confirmed. The accused's bail bonds, if any, have been discharged, and the case has been sent back to the trial court.

In all of these cases, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused demanded and accepted illegal gratification. The burden of proof was on the prosecution, and they could not provide sufficient evidence to prove their case. The court cited previous cases where the mere recovery of tainted money is not enough to convict the accused without evidence of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification. The court also discussed the legal definition of criminal misconduct by a public servant and found that the prosecution failed to prove this charge as well.

The court orders emphasize the importance of following procedural safeguards and providing sufficient evidence to prove allegations of corruption and illegal gratification. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and they must provide evidence of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification to convict the accused. The court also highlights the power of the appellate court to review the evidence and come to its own conclusion in an appeal against acquittal.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of following procedural safeguards and providing sufficient evidence to prove allegations of corruption and illegal gratification.
