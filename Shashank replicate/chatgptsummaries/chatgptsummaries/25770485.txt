The court orders discussed pertain to a wildlife case in which the accused was found guilty of contravening the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The State/Central Bureau of Investigation (Wildlife) had appealed against the sentence passed by the Ld. Trial Court, which released Sunita Kumar on probation for six months. The appellant alleged that the Ld. Trial Court did not consider the gravity of the offences committed by the accused person and had taken a lenient view while sentencing the accused, which was inadequate and against the provisions of section 51(5) of the WL(P) Act, 1972. The sub-section 5 of section 51 of the said Act bars the release of the convict held guilty for offences mentioned in Chapter-V A on probation unless the convict is under the age of 18 years.

The case involved the illegal trade of shahtoosh shawls made from the wool of Tibetan Antelope. The appellant had filed a complaint against the accused, who was found in possession of 17 such shawls without a license. The court summarized the pre-charge evidence presented by the complainant, which included testimony from witnesses who were part of the raiding team and identified the accused and the seized shawls. The court order suggested that the trial court's decision to release the convict on probation was against the mandatory provisions of the law and should be set aside.

The court found sufficient evidence to frame charges against the accused and convicted her, but instead of sentencing her, released her on probation and imposed a fine. The appellant argued that this release on probation was illegal under section 51(5) of the Act. Additionally, an application had been filed for condonation of delay in filing the appeal, which the respondent opposed. The court heard arguments from both sides and was considering the matter.

In another court order, the CBI had filed an appeal in a wildlife case after a delay of more than three months. The court had to decide whether to condone the delay or not. The court observed that while the law requires a broad view in the matter of condonation of limitation, parties concerned are supposed to follow their matters with due diligence. The court also noted that the State cannot claim any special treatment and must be treated like any other litigant. The court referred to previous cases where delay was condoned or not condoned based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Ultimately, the court dismissed the appeal on the ground of delay as the CBI failed to provide any acceptable and cogent reasons for the delay.

In the last court order, the CBI's appeal was dismissed due to a delay in filing the appeal. The court found that the CBI did not provide a sufficient explanation for the delay of over three months in considering whether the judgment was fit for appeal or not. The court also dismissed the CBI's application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act. As a consequence, the appeal was dismissed, and the trial court record was sent back.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed pertain to a wildlife case in which the accused was found guilty of contravening the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The State/Central Bureau of Investigation (Wildlife) had appealed against the sentence passed by the Ld. Trial Court, which released Sunita Kumar on probation for six months.

The CBI's appeal was dismissed due to a delay in filing the appeal, and the court also dismissed the CBI's application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act.
