Dr. Hema Jain filed a revision petition against an order passed by Ld. MM-01, Dwarka Court, New Delhi, in relation to FIR No. 85/14 under Section 8/24 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 and 506 IPC. The revisionist challenged the dismissal of her application for directing the prosecution to place on record her statement recorded during investigation and another application for recalling witnesses for further cross-examination. The Ld. MM dismissed both applications, stating that the CD placed on record had never been exhibited in the testimony of any witness and that the charge-sheet did not mention any statement of the accused. The revision petition was filed under Section 397 r/w 401 Cr.P.C.

The court dismissed two applications made by the accused, one for the prosecution to file the statement of the accused recorded during the investigation and the other for two witnesses to be recalled for further cross-examination. The court cited previous judgments to explain that orders that substantially affect the rights of the accused cannot be considered interlocutory and therefore cannot be revised. The court also referred to Section 397(2) of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which allows the High Court or any Sessions Judge to call for and examine the records of any proceeding to exercise powers of revision.

The court order grants the power of revision to examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior Criminal Court for the purpose of ensuring correctness, legality, or propriety of any finding, sentence, or order. The term "interlocutory order" is defined as an order other than a final decision, and orders that substantially affect the rights of the accused or decide certain rights of the parties cannot be considered interlocutory orders. The purpose of the bar on the power of revision in relation to any interlocutory order is to bring about expeditious disposal of cases.

The court order discusses the meaning of "interlocutory order" in relation to criminal cases and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The purpose of the term is to reduce delays in the various stages of a criminal case. The order also distinguishes between interlocutory orders and final orders, with the former not determining the rights of the parties and only addressing one aspect of the trial. The specific case being discussed involves a request for the prosecution to file a statement of the accused and recall certain witnesses, which the court determines to be an interlocutory order and therefore not subject to revision.

The court has dismissed a revision petition seeking to direct the respondent to bring on record the statement of the accused and to summon two witnesses for further cross-examination. The court cited Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. and Neelam Mahajan & Anr. Vs. State & Ors. to support its decision that the impugned order is an interlocutory order and therefore not maintainable. The revision file has been consigned to the record room and a copy of the judgment has been sent to the trial court for information.

In summary, the court order pertains to a revision petition filed by Dr. Hema Jain against an order passed by Ld. MM-01, Dwarka Court, New Delhi, in relation to FIR No. 85/14 under Section 8/24 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 and 506 IPC.
