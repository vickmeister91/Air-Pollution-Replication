In a case filed by the Shella Action Committee (SAC), the petitioner claimed that the respondents, including two corporate bodies and a cement factory, were operating in violation of various laws and causing loss of revenue to the state of Meghalaya and the indigenous people residing within the Sixth Schedule area. The petitioner claimed to be a registered society formed to protect the poor, illiterate, and indigenous people of Shella village. However, the court found that the petitioner had no proof of being a registered society and had some personal grudge against the respondents. The court also referred to a previous judgment in which the issues raised by the petitioner were already answered. The court dismissed the petition.

The court order allows Lafarge's IA No. 1868 of 2007 with no order as to costs and dismisses SAC's IA No. 2937 of 2010. The interim order passed by the court on 5-2-2010 shall also stand vacated. The judgment notes that most members of SAC were not residents of Shella Village and that the villagers were satisfied with Lafarge's mining company, which provided health care facilities, drinking water facilities, employment, schools, etc. The order also includes agreed conditions between the parties, including the deposit of a sum of Rs. 55 crores towards five times of the normal NPV, the setting up of an SPV, and compliance with all conditions imposed earlier. The order also mentions the transfer of land from LMMPL to LUMPL.

The court order pertains to the transfer of land from Lum Mawshun Minerals Pvt. Ltd. to Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd. The State Government permitted the transfer of 150.6 hectares of land at Shella/Nongtrai from LMMPL to LUMPL after following due process of law under the Meghalaya Transfer of Land (Regulation) Act, 1971. The project of respondent No.8 has started contributing substantially to the State exchequer and is also contributing to the economy and livelihood of the local people through various measures in terms of CSR activities. The court dismissed the PIL filed by the Shella Action Committee as the real landowners, whose lands have been transferred, are satisfied and not aggrieved.

The court order states that if any landowner claims that their land has been transferred without payment, it is a title dispute that cannot be decided by the court in this case. The respondents have provided evidence of the benefits of their mining activities, including financial contributions to the local community and the government. The petitioner's claim of land title is unfounded, as they have not produced any evidence of illegal transfer. The state authorities followed regulations when granting permission for land transfer.

The court order dismisses a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the petitioner against the transfer of land to respondents No. 7, 8, and 9. The court finds that the petitioner has no substantial cause and has filed the PIL with ill design. The court also notes that the mining operation by respondents No. 7 to 9 has generated revenue and contributed to the economic growth and welfare of the area. The court orders the petitioner to pay costs of Rs. 20,000 and dismisses the PIL without prejudice to any pending or future suits regarding the title of the land.

In summary, the court orders in these cases pertain to the transfer of land from Lum Mawshun Minerals Pvt. Ltd. to Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd. The State Government permitted the transfer of 150.6 hectares of land at Shella/Nongtrai from LMMPL to LUMPL after following due process of law under the Meghalaya Transfer of Land (Regulation) Act, 1971.
