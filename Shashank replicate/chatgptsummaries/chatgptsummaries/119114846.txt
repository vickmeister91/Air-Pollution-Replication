In a recent court order, Kamlesh and Umed were granted bail after being accused of hunting a Chital in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The two had been in custody since September 4, 2017, and had no prior criminal history. The court directed them to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC or Trial Court. Additionally, the applicants were instructed to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect India's wildlife and biodiversity. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including birds and reptiles, without a permit from the government. The act also prohibits the trade in wildlife and their products, as well as the destruction of their habitats.

In this case, Kamlesh and Umed were accused of violating the act by hunting a Chital, which is a species of deer found in India. The act provides for severe penalties for such offenses, including imprisonment for up to seven years and fines of up to Rs. 25,000.

However, the court granted bail to the accused, taking into account their lack of criminal history and the fact that they had been in custody for a considerable period. The court also imposed certain conditions on their release, such as the requirement to furnish a bail bond and comply with the provisions of the Cr.P.C.

Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. provides for certain conditions that must be met by a person seeking bail. These include the requirement to attend court on all scheduled dates, not to leave the country without the court's permission, and not to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The court's decision to grant bail in this case is significant as it highlights the importance of considering the individual circumstances of each case when deciding on bail. While the offense of hunting a protected species is undoubtedly serious, the court recognized that the accused had no prior criminal history and had been in custody for a considerable period.

Furthermore, the court's decision to impose certain conditions on the accused's release demonstrates the need to ensure that those accused of such offenses are held accountable for their actions. By requiring the accused to comply with the provisions of the Cr.P.C., the court has ensured that they will be held responsible for their actions and will not be able to evade justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Kamlesh and Umed in this case is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to protect India's wildlife and biodiversity. While the offense of hunting a protected species is undoubtedly serious, the court recognized the individual circumstances of the accused and imposed certain conditions on their release to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions. This decision serves as a reminder of the importance of considering the individual circumstances of each case when deciding on bail and the need to ensure that those accused of such offenses are held accountable for their actions.
