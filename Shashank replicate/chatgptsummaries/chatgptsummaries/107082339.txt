In a recent case registered under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, an application was made by the accused, Mahesh, under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the production of the income tax return of the complainant, Mathura Prasad Sharma. However, the court rejected the application on the grounds that the income tax return of the complainant was not relevant to the case.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or thing that it considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, Mahesh had argued that the income tax return of the complainant was necessary to establish his financial status and credibility as a witness in the case.

However, the court found that the income tax return of the complainant was not relevant to the case. The court noted that the case was registered under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds. The court found that the income tax return of the complainant had no bearing on the issue of dishonour of cheques and therefore rejected the application.

Mahesh subsequently filed a revision petition challenging the order of the court. However, the revision was also rejected by the court. The court reiterated that the income tax return of the complainant was not relevant to the case and therefore there was no reason to produce it.

This case highlights the importance of relevance in the production of documents in a court of law. While Section 91 of Cr.P.C. provides for the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, the court must ensure that the document or thing is relevant to the case at hand. In this case, the court found that the income tax return of the complainant was not relevant to the issue of dishonour of cheques and therefore rejected the application for its production.

It is also important to note that the court has the discretion to reject an application for the production of a document or thing even if it is relevant to the case. This discretion is based on various factors such as the nature of the document or thing, the stage of the proceedings, and the interests of justice. In this case, the court exercised its discretion to reject the application for the production of the income tax return of the complainant.

In conclusion, the court rejected an application made by the accused, Mahesh, for the production of the income tax return of the complainant, Mathura Prasad Sharma, in a case registered under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court found that the income tax return of the complainant was not relevant to the case and therefore rejected the application. The revision filed by Mahesh was also rejected by the court. This case highlights the importance of relevance in the production of documents in a court of law and the discretion of the court to reject an application even if the document or thing is relevant to the case.
