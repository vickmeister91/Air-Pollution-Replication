The court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of a complaint filed against the petitioners for allegedly stealing confidential information from their employer, M/s Greyb Consultancy Service Ltd., and using it for their own gain by starting a rival company. The complaint was filed under Section 379, 406 read with Section 120-B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Section 72 of Information Technology Act, 2000. The court rejected the petition and upheld the summoning order passed by the learned Magistrate under Sections 378, 406 and 120-B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Section 72 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

The court order states that the petitioners are residing outside the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate at Panchkula, and therefore, the order could not be passed without holding an inquiry in terms of Section 202 (1) Cr.P.C. The petitioners argued that there was non-compliance of provisions of Section 210 Cr.P.C. and that the allegations in the complaint and the evidence led in support thereof at the preliminary stage do not make out a prima facie offense for which the petitioners have been summoned. The court found substance in the contention on behalf of the petitioners and held that examination of the complainant in this case as CW-1 by the trial Court was basically an act of taking cognizance of the complaint. The court also referred to a previous case where the duty of a Magistrate receiving a complaint was set out in Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order states that the scope of enquiry under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is limited to determining the truth or falsehood of the allegations made in the complaint, for the purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case for issue of process has been made. The court also notes that an amendment to Section 202 makes it obligatory for the Magistrate to enquire into the case himself or direct investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, before summoning the accused residing beyond his jurisdiction. The court finds that the Magistrate in this case failed to carry out any enquiry or order investigation as contemplated under the amended Section 202, and therefore the impugned order cannot be sustained. The court also notes that the Magistrate was not bound to seek a report of the police in terms of Section 210 Cr.P.C. as no matter was pending with the police.

The court order pertains to a case where the complainant was allegedly cheated using secret data made available to the accused during their employment. The court has set aside the order of summoning and remitted the matter to the Magistrate to proceed further in accordance with the law. The order was issued on December 11, 2013. The document has been attested for accuracy and integrity.

In summary, the court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of a complaint filed against the petitioners for allegedly stealing confidential information from their employer and using it for their own gain by starting a rival company. The court rejected the petition and upheld the summoning order passed by the learned Magistrate. However, the court also found that the Magistrate failed to carry out any enquiry or order investigation as contemplated under the amended Section 202, and therefore the impugned order cannot be sustained. The court has set aside the order of summoning and remitted the matter to the Magistrate to proceed further in accordance with the law.
