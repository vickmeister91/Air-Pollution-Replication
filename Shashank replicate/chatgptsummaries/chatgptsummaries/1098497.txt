The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of villages Batamandi and Ganguwala against the expansion of a fermentation plant by M/s. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited. The petitioners allege that the respondents have violated various provisions of law and started construction without legal permission, which will cause environmental degradation. The court had directed the Deputy Commissioner to ensure that no unauthorized construction activity is carried out. 

A committee was set up to investigate the legality, propriety, and correctness of the setting up of the two units and to report on whether any laws relating to land acquisition, transfer, possession, ecological or environmental norms or laws have been violated. The committee was also directed to find out whether the setting up of these units or their expected/anticipated functioning ultimately has any potential of creating nuisance in the area adversely affecting the lives of the people living in the area. 

The court heard arguments on various issues, including legal, procedural, and environmental issues, and the respondent No. 4 admitted to some violations but claimed to have remedied them. The court considered the violation of the Development Plan of Paonta Sahib and noted that no expansion of the plant of respondent No. 4 at Ganguwala could have been permitted, especially an expansion of 15 times from 8 TPA to 120 TPA. 

The court order discusses the violation of various legal provisions by M/s. Ranbaxy Laboratories in setting up their plant in Paonta Sahib. The Development Plan for the area was violated, and the State Government did not take note of the fact that no further expansion should be permitted for the company. The land was purchased without proper permission, and there was a violation of the TCP Act. The Factories Act was also violated, and no approval was obtained for the hazardous process. The Zoning Atlas was also violated, and the plant was set up in a highly aerial sensitive area. The court found clear violations of the Development Plan and TCP Act and held that the plant was being set up in total violation of the Development Plan for Paonta Sahib. 

The court order discusses the potential water pollution impact of the fermentation plant of Ranbaxy Laboratory and the importance of the Zoning Atlas and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in determining the siting of industries. The court finds that no proper EIA has been conducted for the proposed expansion of the plant and criticizes the Pollution Control Board for allowing the manufacture of Statin drugs without obtaining any EIA. The court also considers the issue of water usage by the plant and the report of the Central Ground Water Board, which recommends that the plant be permitted to draw water beyond the depth of 70 meters below ground level and that regular monitoring be done to ensure no adverse impact on the availability or quality of ground water. The court orders the respondent No. 4 to take suitable remedial actions if any adverse impact is discovered. 

The court order discusses a case involving a company's proposed expansion of its pharmaceutical plant in India. The court considers issues related to water availability, effluent discharge, solid waste management, and air pollution. The court notes that the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has not conducted site-specific studies on groundwater availability, but the CGWB and the Expert Body on the subject believe that the groundwater resources in the area are sufficient to meet the additional demand of the company. The court accepts the recommendations of the Committee on issues related to effluent discharge and solid waste management, but directs the company to provide details on the diesel generating sets proposed to be used and for the pollution control boards to submit recommendations on their potential impact on air pollution. 

The court order discusses the violations of various laws and regulations by Ranbaxy Plant and the recommendations made by a committee regarding the impact of the plant on the environment. The court directs the plant to furnish details of the diesel generating sets proposed to be used and to address the issue of incinerator stack emissions. The court also directs the plant to prepare a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environment Management Plan (EMP) before any further construction can take place. The court further directs the plant to ensure that the presence of Dioxin and Furans in the flue gases emitted from the incinerator is reduced to levels below the limits recommended by the Central Pollution Control Board before the plant can be permitted to be set up. 

The court order states that a plant cannot be set up unless it complies with the limits recommended by the Central Pollution Control Board. The plant proponent must provide clear scientific data on how they will reduce the emission of dioxin and furans. The report of the Committee and the recommendations of the Central Pollution Control Board must be considered, and prescribed norms for gases must be laid down within 8 weeks. Public hearings will be held after the EIA and EMP are filed. The expansion of the fermentation plant at Ganguwala cannot be permitted until a comprehensive EIA and EMP is prepared and all requisite permissions are obtained. The formulation plant at Batamandi can be set up subject to specific directions. 

The court appreciates the work done by the Committee and experts. Social issues recommendations are beyond the scope of the reference made by the court to the Committee.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of villages Batamandi and Ganguwala against the expansion of a fermentation plant by M/s. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited.
