The court order pertains to a case where Sushila Devi filed a complaint alleging that her husband was killed by the Special Operation Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was directed to investigate the matter, and after several status reports and supplementary charge-sheets, some accused were arrested and charged, while others remained absconding. The court was asked to decide whether it should continue to monitor the investigation after the charge-sheet had been filed. The court decided to continue monitoring the case.

The court order discusses a case in which the CBI moved the court for registration of an FIR against four absconding accused persons. One of the accused was found murdered, and an important witness died in a road accident. The court is considering whether to monitor the case, with some arguing that monitoring is necessary to ensure a fair trial, while others argue that monitoring is unnecessary once a charge-sheet has been filed and the matter is before a competent court. The court cites previous cases to support the position that monitoring ends once the investigation is completed and a charge-sheet is filed.

The court order states that once an investigating agency appointed by the court completes its investigation, files a charge-sheet, and takes steps in accordance with the law before a competent court, it is not necessary for the court to continue monitoring the trial. The court has already held in previous decisions that monitoring of a case is continued until the investigation continues. However, once the investigation is completed, it is not proper for the court to keep monitoring the trial. Therefore, the court directs that it is not necessary to monitor the matter any further since it is in the domain of the competent court. All applications are disposed of accordingly.

The court order pertains to two cases where the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was investigating the matter. In the first case, Sushila Devi filed a complaint alleging that her husband was killed by the Special Operation Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police. The CBI was directed to investigate the matter, and after several status reports and supplementary charge-sheets, some accused were arrested and charged, while others remained absconding. The court was asked to decide whether it should continue to monitor the investigation after the charge-sheet had been filed. The court decided to continue monitoring the case.

In the second case, the CBI moved the court for registration of an FIR against four absconding accused persons. One of the accused was found murdered, and an important witness died in a road accident. The court is considering whether to monitor the case, with some arguing that monitoring is necessary to ensure a fair trial, while others argue that monitoring is unnecessary once a charge-sheet has been filed and the matter is before a competent court. The court cites previous cases to support the position that monitoring ends once the investigation is completed and a charge-sheet is filed.

The court order states that once an investigating agency appointed by the court completes its investigation, files a charge-sheet, and takes steps in accordance with the law before a competent court, it is not necessary for the court to continue monitoring the trial. The court has already held in previous decisions that monitoring of a case is continued until the investigation continues. However, once the investigation is completed, it is not proper for the court to keep monitoring the trial. Therefore, the court directs that it is not necessary to monitor the matter any further since it is in the domain of the competent court. All applications are disposed of accordingly.

The court's decision to continue monitoring the first case is significant as it shows the court's commitment to ensuring that justice is served. The fact that some accused persons were arrested and charged while others remained absconding indicates that the investigation is ongoing and that there is a possibility of further arrests and charges. By continuing to monitor the case, the court is sending a message that it will not tolerate any attempts to subvert the course of justice.

In the second case, the court's decision not to monitor the matter any further is in line with its previous decisions. The court has consistently held that once the investigation is completed and a charge-sheet is filed, it is not necessary for the court to continue monitoring the trial. This is because the matter is now in the domain of the competent court, which is responsible for ensuring that justice is served.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of the rule of law and the need for a fair and impartial justice system. By ensuring that investigations are conducted properly and that trials are fair, the court is upholding the principles of justice and protecting the rights of citizens. It is important for the court to continue to monitor cases where necessary to ensure that justice is served and that the rule of law is upheld.
