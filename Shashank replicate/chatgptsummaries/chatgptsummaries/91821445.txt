The court order in question pertains to a contempt petition filed by Santosh Shrikrishna Pachalag against Mr. K. P. Bakshi, Additional Chief. The petitioner had alleged that Mr. Bakshi had violated the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, by allowing the use of loudspeakers without permission in Navi Mumbai.

The court noted that there was no single place of religion in Navi Mumbai using a loudspeaker without permission in 2018, according to a chart appended at Exhibit-A. The court also observed that the data in the chart on pages 17 to 20 showed that there were several instances of loudspeakers being used without permission in various places in Navi Mumbai.

The court granted time of four weeks to the sixth respondent to file an additional affidavit giving all necessary particulars about the action taken under section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. This section deals with the powers of the Central Pollution Control Board to take measures to prevent and control environmental pollution.

The court also granted the State one month to file an affidavit dealing with the allegations made on the basis of data in the chart on pages 17 to 20. The State was directed to provide details of the action taken against the violators of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.

The court ordered that the contempt petition be placed on 27th November 2018 under the caption of "Fresh Admission". This means that the case will be heard afresh and all parties will have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the issue of noise pollution and the need for strict enforcement of the rules and regulations governing the use of loudspeakers. The court's direction to the State to provide details of the action taken against violators is a welcome step towards ensuring that the rules are followed and the environment is protected.

In conclusion, the court's order in the contempt petition filed by Santosh Shrikrishna Pachalag against Mr. K. P. Bakshi is an important step towards addressing the issue of noise pollution in Navi Mumbai. The court's direction to the State to provide details of the action taken against violators is a positive development and will hopefully lead to stricter enforcement of the rules and regulations governing the use of loudspeakers.
