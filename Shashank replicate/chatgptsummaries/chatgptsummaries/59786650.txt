The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of proceedings in a criminal case against the petitioner for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The allegations were that 15 monkeys died after being caught in a muddy area of a tailing dam maintained by a company where the petitioner was working as Assistant General Manager. The court found that even if the allegations were taken at face value, the offence under the Act would not be made out and therefore allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and conservation of endangered species. The Act also provides for penalties for offences committed against wildlife, including imprisonment and fines.

In the present case, the petitioner was accused of offences under the Act for the death of 15 monkeys in a tailing dam maintained by the company where he was working as Assistant General Manager. The allegations were that the monkeys had died after being caught in a muddy area of the dam. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking quashing of the proceedings against him.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The section provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

The court, in its order, noted that the allegations against the petitioner were that he had failed to take adequate measures to prevent the death of the monkeys. However, the court found that even if the allegations were taken at face value, the offence under the Act would not be made out. The court observed that the Act provides for penalties for offences committed against wildlife, but the offence in question did not fall within the ambit of the Act.

The court further observed that the Act provides for penalties for offences committed against wildlife, but the offence in question did not fall within the ambit of the Act. The court noted that the Act provides for penalties for hunting, poaching, or trading in wildlife, but there was no allegation that the petitioner had engaged in any such activity. The court also noted that the Act provides for penalties for destruction of wildlife habitats, but there was no allegation that the petitioner had destroyed any habitat.

The court, therefore, allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings against the petitioner. The court observed that the allegations against the petitioner did not make out an offence under the Act and that the proceedings against him were therefore liable to be quashed.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of proceedings in a criminal case against the petitioner for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found that even if the allegations were taken at face value, the offence under the Act would not be made out and therefore allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings.
