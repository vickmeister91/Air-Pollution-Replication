The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case in which an employee of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board was promoted to the post of Environmental Engineer but later reverted to the feeder post of Assistant Environmental Engineer. The petitioner argued that his promotion was based on a conscious decision taken after examining his eligibility and other incidental issues, and that the reversion was bad and had the effect of setting aside the final gradation list without any challenge to it. The respondents argued that the promotion was based on an erroneous procedure and flouted government norms and the Board's own service regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and will issue a judgement.

The court order discusses a writ petition filed by a petitioner who was reverted to a feeder post after being promoted. The respondents argue that no legally protected right of the petitioner was infringed and that the promotion was not in conformity with the state government's promotional norms. The petitioner denies the allegations and challenges the decision as violative of the principles of natural justice. The court finds that the respondents' attempt to justify their action based on service jurisprudence is not applicable to the case and that compliance with the principles of natural justice would have served a purpose.

The court order discusses exceptions to the principle of natural justice, where a fair hearing would make no difference and no legal duty to provide a hearing arises. However, such exceptions can only be resorted to by courts when the facts are indisputable and the failure to comply with the principles of natural justice causes no prejudice to the party complaining. The court also emphasizes the autonomy of a statutory body and the need for it to exercise its own discretion, rather than being influenced by external authorities. The order ultimately sets aside the decision of the Board due to its failure to exercise its own discretion and instead following the opinion of an external authority.

The court order states that the Secretary of the Board was not bound by the opinion expressed by the Principal Secretary and should have exercised independent judgment. The court cites previous cases where discretionary power must be exercised by designated officials and not influenced by external authorities. The Board in this case interpreted the opinion as a direction and did not apply independent judgment, rendering the order unsustainable in law and set aside. The petitioner is to be restored to the promotional post and receive financial benefits within a specified time frame. No costs are awarded, and a certified copy of the order will be supplied to the parties upon request.

In summary, the case involved a dispute over the promotion of an employee of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. The petitioner argued that his promotion was based on a conscious decision taken after examining his eligibility and other incidental issues, and that the reversion was bad and had the effect of setting aside the final gradation list without any challenge to it. The respondents argued that the promotion was based on an erroneous procedure and flouted government norms and the Board's own service regulations.
