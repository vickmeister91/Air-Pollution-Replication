The case in question involves a petition filed by Ramniwas, son of Shri Sovransingh, under Section 482Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.3, Badi, Dholpur. The order in question refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner, which were case property of case FIR No.65/2019, registered at Police Station Sarmathura, Dholpur, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Section 29, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act and Sections 30, 31, 32, 41 and 42 of Indian Forest Act.

The petitioner argued that the Supreme Court has held that the vehicle should not be permitted to remain parked in the police station as it shall gather rust and shall not remain useful. The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and allowed the petition. The trial court was directed to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the vehicle should not be allowed to remain parked in the police station as it would gather rust and become useless. The court also took into consideration the fact that the tractor and trolley were case property and therefore subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that case property is not allowed to deteriorate while in police custody. It also emphasizes the need for courts to take into consideration the practical implications of their decisions, such as the impact on the usefulness of seized property.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that seized property is properly cared for and that courts take into consideration the practical implications of their decisions.
