The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving hazardous chemical plants in densely populated areas. The first order involves a caustic chlorine plant owned by Delhi Cloth Mills Ltd. that had several units engaged in the manufacture of hazardous and lethal chemicals and gases. Following a major leakage of oleum gas in December 1985, the Delhi Administration issued an order directing the plant to cease operations. The court appointed several expert committees to assess the situation and make recommendations. The court ultimately allowed the plant to restart operations subject to stringent conditions, but also recommended the establishment of Environment Courts to deal with cases involving environmental pollution and conflicts over natural resources.

The second court order discusses the liability of corporations in cases of negligence and the remedies available for those affected. The case in question involves a leakage of oleum gas from a unit of Shriram Foods and Fertiliser Industries, which affected several people and resulted in the death of an advocate. The court is deciding whether to allow the caustic chlorine plant of Shriram Foods and Fertiliser Industries to be restarted, and has appointed various committees to inspect the plant and make recommendations for minimizing hazards to workers and the public. The court is also adjudicating claims for compensation on behalf of victims of the gas leakage.

The third court order involves the Lt. Governor of Delhi constituting an expert committee to investigate the causes of the oleum gas spillage and its after-effects, to examine safety procedures, and to fix responsibility for the leakage of oleum gas. The committee recommended that the caustic chlorine plant of Shriram be relocated to eliminate risk to the community. The court considered whether the plant should be allowed to reopen and concluded that, while the risk to the community could be minimized, it could not be completely eliminated. The court allowed the reopening of certain plants, but only after ensuring that safety measures were in place. The court also emphasized the need for a national policy on the location of toxic or hazardous industries.

The fourth court order discusses the reopening of the caustic chlorine plant of Shriram, which had been closed due to safety concerns. The court appointed a committee to inspect the plant and ensure that all recommendations for safety had been implemented. The committee found that all recommendations had been complied with, and the plant could be reopened. However, there were concerns about the potential hazard of chlorine gas, and the court had to balance the safety of the community with the interests of the workmen and the company. Ultimately, the court allowed the plant to be reopened with strict safety conditions.

The fifth court order allows the caustic chlorine plant to be restarted, but with certain conditions to be strictly observed by the management of Shriram. The interests of the workmen must also be considered, as permanently closing down the plant would lead to their unemployment and impoverishment. The court also addresses issues of water and air pollution caused by Shriram's plants, and requires compliance with the Water and Air Acts. The Delhi Municipal Corporation is criticized for not cleaning up a chocked sewer, which has prevented Shriram from discharging its domestic effluent. The court permits Shriram to restart its power plant and other manufacturing plants, but two orders prohibiting their use are being challenged in court.

The sixth court order has suspended two orders against Shriram, allowing them to reopen their plants temporarily, but with strict conditions. An expert committee will monitor the operation and maintenance of the caustic chlorine plant, ensuring the implementation of recommendations made by previous committees. The management must designate operators responsible for safety devices and measures, and the head of the caustic chlorine division must be responsible for their efficient operation. The Chief Inspector of Factories and the Central Board will inspect the plant regularly, and a committee of representatives from two unions will oversee safety arrangements. The management must provide training and instruction to workers, maintain vigilance, and deposit a sum of money as security for compensation claims.

The final court order has ordered Shriram to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs.15 lacs to the satisfaction of the Registrar of the Court, which will be encashed in case there is any escape of chlorine gas resulting in death or injury to any workman or person living in the vicinity. The amount will be used towards compensation for victims of chlorine gas. Shriram must also deposit Rs.20 lacs and furnish the bank guarantee within two weeks, or the permission to restart the plant will be withdrawn. The court suggests setting up a High Powered Authority to oversee hazardous industries and a national policy for locating such industries in areas with little risk to the community. The court also recommends setting up an independent Ecological Sciences Research Group to provide scientific and technological input for cases involving environmental pollution and ecological destruction. The petitioner is appreciated for bringing the public interest litigation, and Shriram must pay Rs.10,000 as costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of ensuring the safety of workers and the community in industries that deal with hazardous chemicals and gases. The courts have taken a cautious approach, allowing the reopening of plants only after ensuring that strict safety measures are in place and that the risk to the community is minimized as much as possible. The orders also emphasize the need for a national policy on the location of toxic or hazardous industries and the establishment of Environment Courts to deal with cases involving environmental pollution and conflicts over natural resources. The liability of corporations in cases of negligence and the remedies available for those affected are also
