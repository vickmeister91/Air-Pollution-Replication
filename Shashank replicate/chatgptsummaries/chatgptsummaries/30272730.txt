The court order in question pertains to a repeat application for bail under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P. C.) filed by Mehtab, who was arrested on 11th July 2016 for hunting deer in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. It is worth noting that Mehtab had previously filed an application for bail, which was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file the same after three months.

In this latest application, Mehtab sought bail on the grounds that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that he was not a habitual offender. The court considered the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense and ultimately allowed the application.

However, the court did impose certain conditions on Mehtab's release. Specifically, he was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- along with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. Additionally, he was required to abide by certain conditions under Section 437 (3) of the Cr. P. C.

These conditions included reporting to the investigating officer as and when required, refraining from tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, and not leaving the jurisdiction of the trial court without prior permission. Mehtab was also directed to surrender his passport, if any, and to not apply for a new one without the court's permission.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail to Mehtab does not mean that he has been acquitted of the charges against him. Rather, it simply means that he will be released from custody pending the outcome of the trial.

In reaching its decision, the court considered a number of factors, including the seriousness of the offense, the strength of the evidence against Mehtab, and his criminal history. Ultimately, the court found that Mehtab was not a flight risk and that he was unlikely to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

It is worth noting that the court's decision to grant bail is not final and can be challenged by the prosecution. Additionally, Mehtab will be required to appear in court as and when required and to cooperate with the investigation.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a repeat application for bail under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. filed by Mehtab, who was arrested for hunting deer in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the application and directed Mehtab to abide by certain conditions, including furnishing a personal bond and surety, reporting to the investigating officer, and surrendering his passport. While the decision to grant bail does not mean that Mehtab has been acquitted of the charges against him, it does allow him to be released from custody pending the outcome of the trial.
