The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Karaikal Port Private Limited against the National Green Tribunal and other government bodies. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Tribunal for the constitution of a Joint Committee with the participation of the Central Pollution Control Board and the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee. The petitioner argued that they were not given an opportunity to present their case and that they had established the Mechanised Coal Handling System, which had been approved by the PPCC. The court considered the arguments and ordered that the writ petition be dismissed.

The court order states that the Prevention of Control of Pollution Act cannot be used in this case as it is the responsibility of the State Boards to handle the matter. The court also clarifies the role of various authorities in the Joint Committee and allows the private respondent to be present during inspections. The proposed action can only be taken after the report is filed before the National Green Tribunal and both parties are heard. The Committee has been given six weeks to submit the report. The writ petition is disposed of and related cases are closed. The order is to be sent to various authorities.

The court order lists the contact information for the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of Puducherry and the Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu's Health and Family Welfare Department. The order is related to a case with the reference number W.P. No. 33942 of 2018 and was issued on January 29, 2019.
