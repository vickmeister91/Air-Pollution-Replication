The court order in question pertains to a case between Alok Thakur and Manoj Sharma. Thakur had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. seeking the production of various financial documents from Sharma, including the partnership deed, particulars of the amount of partnership, and income tax documents. Thakur claimed that he needed these documents to understand the financial capacity of Sharma, who was the complainant/respondent in the case.

However, the trial court dismissed Thakur's application, stating that it was filed with ulterior motives to prolong the proceedings. Thakur then appealed to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, but the court upheld the decision of the trial court and dismissed the petition at the motion stage.

The use of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows a court to order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court must be satisfied that the document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding.

In this case, Thakur argued that the financial documents he requested were necessary to understand the financial capacity of Sharma, who was the complainant/respondent in the case. However, the court found that Thakur's application was filed with ulterior motives to prolong the proceedings, rather than for any legitimate purpose.

The court's decision to dismiss Thakur's application at the motion stage means that the case will continue without the production of the requested financial documents. It is unclear what impact, if any, this decision will have on the outcome of the case.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of using legal procedures for legitimate purposes and not for ulterior motives. It also underscores the court's discretion in ordering the production of documents and things under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the need for parties to provide a legitimate reason for requesting such documents.
