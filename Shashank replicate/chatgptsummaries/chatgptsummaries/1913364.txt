The court order pertains to the cutting and removal of bamboo from the Shoolpaneshwar forest area in Gujarat. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was directed to investigate allegations of illegal cutting of trees and bamboo in the sanctuary. The CBI found that Forest Department officials and the Central Pulp and Paper Mills Limited (CPM) violated the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and other laws. The court established that bamboo cutting is a regular process and should be systematic and controlled. The government is responsible for safeguarding wild life, and the management of cutting operations should be entrusted to Forest Department officials. The court also noted that the CPM's contract with the state is set to expire soon, and the government has decided to undertake the work of harvesting bamboo in the area departmentally.

The court order discusses the harvesting of bamboo in the Shoolpaneshwar area and the role of the government and non-governmental organizations in ensuring that the harvesting is done in accordance with expert opinions and without harming wildlife. The court also questions the validity of an order passed by a single judge and concludes that the FIRs filed by the CBI should be quashed, but the materials gathered by the CBI can be used for departmental or other action by the government. One judge disagrees with the majority opinion on the power of the High Court to direct the CBI to investigate without consent of the State Government.
