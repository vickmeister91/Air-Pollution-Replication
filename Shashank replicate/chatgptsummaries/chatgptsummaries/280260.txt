The Delhi Science Forum filed a writ petition against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for acquiring agricultural land without obtaining approval from the Central Government. The petitioner argued that the water level in the area had gone down, and the first respondent was digging ground water in violation of a ban. The first respondent admitted to starting construction in violation of the Delhi Development Act and rules. 

The case was heard in the Delhi High Court, and the court ordered that no further construction should be allowed on the land in question. However, the parties could proceed with obtaining approval from the Central Government in accordance with the law. The court found that the first respondent had not taken any steps to obtain approval for three years, and during that time, a mass housing project was undertaken. 

The court noted that the acquisition of agricultural land without obtaining approval from the Central Government was a violation of the law. The petitioner argued that the construction had caused a depletion of the water table in the area, which was already a water-stressed region. The court found that the first respondent was digging ground water in violation of a ban, which had been imposed to protect the water table. 

The court observed that the first respondent had admitted to starting construction in violation of the Delhi Development Act and rules. The court noted that the first respondent had not obtained the necessary approvals from the Central Government, and had started construction without obtaining the required clearances. The court found that the first respondent had acted in violation of the law, and had caused damage to the environment and the water table in the area. 

The court ordered that no further construction should be allowed on the land in question, until the parties obtained approval from the Central Government in accordance with the law. The court directed the first respondent to stop digging ground water in violation of the ban, and to take steps to restore the water table in the area. The court also directed the first respondent to pay compensation to the petitioner for the damage caused to the environment and the water table. 

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court ordered that no further construction should be allowed on the land in question, until the parties obtained approval from the Central Government in accordance with the law. The court found that the first respondent had acted in violation of the law, and had caused damage to the environment and the water table in the area.
