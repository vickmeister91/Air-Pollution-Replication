The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ petition challenging a consent order issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to run a rice mill. The petitioner had argued that the consent order was arbitrary and illegal, and that it violated the principles of natural justice. The court, however, ruled that the petitioner had an effective alternative remedy available to them, and that the writ petition was therefore not maintainable.

The court noted that the petitioner had the right to file an appeal against the consent order within 30 days of its issuance, and that since the period of limitation had not expired, the petitioner had an effective alternative remedy available to them. The court also observed that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy before approaching the court with the writ petition.

The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition, but gave the petitioner the liberty to move the appellate authority challenging the consent order. The court also kept the contentions of the petitioner on the merits open, meaning that the petitioner could raise the same arguments before the appellate authority.

The case highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court with a writ petition. The court has consistently held that writ jurisdiction should not be invoked if an effective alternative remedy is available to the petitioner. This is because the writ jurisdiction is a discretionary jurisdiction, and the court will not exercise its discretion if the petitioner has not exhausted all other available remedies.

In this case, the court found that the petitioner had an effective alternative remedy available to them, and that they had not exhausted this remedy before approaching the court with the writ petition. The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition, but gave the petitioner the liberty to move the appellate authority challenging the consent order.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making. The petitioner had argued that the consent order was arbitrary and illegal, and that it violated the principles of natural justice. While the court did not go into the merits of these arguments, it did note that the contentions of the petitioner on the merits were being kept open. This means that the petitioner can raise the same arguments before the appellate authority, and that the appellate authority will have to consider these arguments while deciding the appeal.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court with a writ petition, and of following the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making. It also highlights the need for effective and efficient appellate mechanisms to ensure that administrative decisions are subject to meaningful review.
