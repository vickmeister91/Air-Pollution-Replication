The court, however, did not find any strong reasons to interfere with the order passed by the trial court. The court noted that the trial court had correctly applied the law and that Ekbote had not been able to show any error in the trial court's decision. The court also observed that Ekbote had not cross-examined the complainant and that the complainant's evidence was yet to be fully examined.

Despite this, the court allowed Ekbote to make the application again after cross-examination of the complainant. The court noted that Ekbote had a right to seek the production of documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and that he could make the application again once the complainant had been cross-examined. The court, therefore, disposed of the petition and allowed Ekbote to make the application again at a later stage.

The court observed that Ekbote had not been able to show any strong reasons for the stay of the trial court proceedings and that the trial court had correctly applied the law.
