The court order pertains to a regular second appeal that has been pending since 1982. The appellant had challenged an eviction order passed against him for non-conforming use of leased property. The court notes that the appellant has exhausted all legal remedies available to him, including a writ petition and a letters patent appeal, and that an eviction order has been passed against him under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971. The court dismisses the appeal and states that the question of regularization of non-conforming use is now redundant.

The court order in question pertains to a long-standing legal dispute that has been ongoing since 1982. The appellant had challenged an eviction order that had been passed against him for non-conforming use of leased property. The court notes that the appellant had exhausted all legal remedies available to him, including a writ petition and a letters patent appeal. Despite this, an eviction order had been passed against him under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971.

In light of these circumstances, the court dismisses the appeal. The court notes that the question of regularization of non-conforming use is now redundant. This means that the appellant's argument that he should be allowed to continue using the leased property in a non-conforming manner is no longer relevant. The court's decision effectively upholds the eviction order that had been passed against the appellant.

The court order also highlights the fact that the appellant had exhausted all legal remedies available to him. This means that he had pursued all possible avenues of legal recourse in an attempt to challenge the eviction order. Despite this, the court found that the eviction order was valid and that the appellant had no further legal options available to him.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of pursuing legal remedies in a timely and effective manner. It also highlights the fact that, in some cases, legal challenges may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Nonetheless, the court's decision in this case provides clarity and closure to a long-standing legal dispute.

The court order states that the question of regularization of non-conforming use of the suit premises is still a substantial question of law, but it cannot be entertained as it violates Section 11 of the CPC and the second appeal is only permissible when a substantial question of law arises. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

The court order in question pertains to a legal dispute involving the regularization of non-conforming use of the suit premises. The court notes that this is still a substantial question of law. However, the court also notes that this question cannot be entertained as it violates Section 11 of the CPC. This section of the CPC states that a court shall not try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.

In light of this, the court finds that the second appeal is only permissible when a substantial question of law arises. Since the question of regularization of non-conforming use of the suit premises has already been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit, the court finds that it cannot be entertained in this case. As a result, the appeal is dismissed.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the rules and procedures set out in the CPC. It also serves as a reminder that legal disputes can be complex and multifaceted, and that it is important to carefully consider all relevant legal issues before pursuing a legal challenge.
