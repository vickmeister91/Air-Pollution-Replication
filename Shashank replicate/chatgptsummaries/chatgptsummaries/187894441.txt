The first court order pertains to an appeal filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax against Wipro Limited. The dispute is related to the assessment year 1985-86, where Wipro claimed a deduction under Section 80H and 80I for establishing a new factory for manufacturing industrial Vanaspathi. The Assessing Officer rejected the claim, stating that the existing unit was only modernized by adding a few machineries. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and the Tribunal granted relief to Wipro, stating that a new industrial unit was established. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided to consider only two out of three substantial questions of law raised by Wipro. The court also explained the background of the case and the contentions of both parties.

The court noted that the first substantial question of law raised by Wipro was whether the Tribunal was justified in holding that the new industrial unit was established by the assessee. The court observed that the Tribunal had considered all the relevant facts and had come to a conclusion that a new industrial unit was established by the assessee. The court further noted that the Tribunal had relied on the evidence produced by the assessee, which included the certificate of registration of the new unit, the electricity connection, and the sales tax registration. The court held that the Tribunal's finding was a finding of fact and could not be interfered with.

The second substantial question of law raised by Wipro was whether the Tribunal was justified in holding that the assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 80H and 80I. The court noted that Section 80H and 80I provided for deduction in respect of profits and gains derived from the industrial undertakings. The court observed that the Tribunal had considered the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and had come to a conclusion that the assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 80H and 80I. The court held that the Tribunal's finding was a finding of fact and could not be interfered with.

The court did not consider the third substantial question of law raised by Wipro, which was whether the Tribunal was justified in holding that the assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 80J. The court noted that the Tribunal had not given any finding on this issue and had remanded the matter to the Assessing Officer for fresh consideration. The court held that since the Tribunal had not given any finding on this issue, it was not necessary to consider this question of law.

In conclusion, the court upheld the order of the Tribunal and dismissed the appeal filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax. The court held that the Tribunal had considered all the relevant facts and had come to a conclusion that a new industrial unit was established by the assessee and that the assessee was entitled to deduction under Section 80H and 80I.

The second court order pertains to an appeal by an assessee who claimed deduction under Section 80HH and 80I for setting up a new industrial unit. The assessing officer denied the claim, stating that no new machinery was erected in the relevant assessment year and that the purchased machinery was not new. The court considered the judgments cited by the assessee but found them inapplicable to the present case. The court also noted that the assessing officer did not need to inspect the unit as the case was decided based on documents provided by the assessee. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of the revenue and denied the assessee's claim for deduction.

The court noted that the assessee had claimed deduction under Section 80HH and 80I for setting up a new industrial unit. The court observed that the assessing officer had denied the claim on the ground that no new machinery was erected in the relevant assessment year and that the purchased machinery was not new. The court noted that the assessee had relied on certain judgments to support its claim for deduction. However, the court found that those judgments were not applicable to the present case.

The court further noted that the assessing officer had not inspected the unit and had decided the case based on the documents provided by the assessee. The court held that the assessing officer was not required to inspect the unit as the case was decided based on the documents provided by the assessee.

In conclusion, the court upheld the order of the assessing officer and dismissed the appeal filed by the assessee. The court held that the assessee was not entitled to deduction under Section 80HH and 80I as no new machinery was erected in the relevant assessment year and the purchased machinery was not new.
