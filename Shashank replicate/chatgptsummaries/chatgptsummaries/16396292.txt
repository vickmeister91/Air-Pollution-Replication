The court order pertains to two separate cases involving the installation and operation of a hot mix plant without proper permission and license. The first case involves a writ petition filed by two private parties seeking to quash the installation of a hot mix plant without permission from the Panchayat under the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. The appellant, who had obtained consent to establish and operate the plant from the Pollution Control Board, challenged an interim order directing the Panchayat to decide whether a license was required under Section 233(b)(2) of the Act.

The court heard both the writ petition and the appeal together and observed that once the plant was operated in accordance with the conditions specified in the consent, the question of pollution may not arise. The court noted that the Pollution Control Board had already granted consent to establish and operate the plant, which means that the plant had already undergone a thorough assessment of its environmental impact. The court also noted that the plant was being operated in accordance with the conditions specified in the consent, which means that the plant was being operated in a manner that would not cause any harm to the environment.

The court further observed that the Panchayat had not provided any evidence to suggest that the plant was causing any pollution or harm to the environment. The court also noted that the Panchayat had not provided any evidence to suggest that the plant was operating in violation of any of the conditions specified in the consent. Therefore, the court held that the interim order directing the Panchayat to decide whether a license was required under Section 233(b)(2) of the Act was not justified and quashed the same.

The second case involves a hot mixing plant and whether it requires permission or a license to operate. The Pollution Control Board had given consent to establish and operate the plant, but there were concerns about pollution levels. The court found that the plant did not require permission under Section 233 or a license under Section 232 of the Act, as it was a temporary plant used for construction purposes. The court also noted that the plant was being used for the construction of a national highway, which was in the public interest.

The court observed that the plant was being operated in accordance with the conditions specified in the consent granted by the Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the plant was being operated for a temporary period and was being used for construction purposes only. Therefore, the court held that the plant did not require permission under Section 233 or a license under Section 232 of the Act.

The court further observed that the construction of a national highway was in the public interest and that the operation of the plant was necessary for the completion of the project. The court noted that the plant was being operated in a manner that would not cause any harm to the environment and that the concerns about pollution levels were unfounded. Therefore, the court disposed of the case accordingly.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate cases involving the installation and operation of a hot mix plant without proper permission and license. The court observed that the plants were being operated in accordance with the conditions specified in the consent granted by the Pollution Control Board and that the concerns about pollution levels were unfounded. The court also noted that the operation of the plants was necessary for the completion of public projects and that the plants did not require permission or license under the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. Therefore, the court quashed the interim order directing the Panchayat to decide whether a license was required under Section 233(b)(2) of the Act and disposed of the case accordingly.
