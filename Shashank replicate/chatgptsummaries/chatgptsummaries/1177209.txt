The Karnataka High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by M Shivanna and others against M/S Gemini Distilleries Pvt Ltd. The petitioners alleged that the respondent was causing water and air pollution by discharging effluents during the manufacture of spirit, and that the land around the distillery had been affected. The petitioners sought the closure of the manufacturing unit and restoration of the water and soil quality in the area.

The court, after hearing both parties, directed the Pollution Control Board to ensure that the conditions of the consent order granted to the respondent were duly complied with. The court also directed the respondent to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs with the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority within a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The amount was to be utilized for the restoration of the environment in the area.

The court observed that the respondent had obtained a consent order from the Pollution Control Board for the establishment and operation of the distillery. The consent order contained various conditions, including the installation of an effluent treatment plant, the maintenance of a green belt around the distillery, and the submission of regular reports to the Pollution Control Board.

The court noted that the respondent had violated several of these conditions, leading to the pollution of the environment in the area. The court also observed that the respondent had not taken adequate measures to restore the environment, despite being directed to do so by the Pollution Control Board.

The court, therefore, directed the Pollution Control Board to ensure that the respondent complied with all the conditions of the consent order. The court also directed the respondent to submit a report to the Pollution Control Board within a period of four weeks from the date of the order, detailing the steps taken to comply with the conditions of the consent order.

The court further directed the respondent to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs with the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority within a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The amount was to be utilized for the restoration of the environment in the area.

The court also directed the Pollution Control Board to conduct regular inspections of the distillery to ensure that the conditions of the consent order were being complied with. The court warned that any violation of the conditions of the consent order would result in the closure of the manufacturing unit.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict compliance with the conditions of consent orders granted by the Pollution Control Board. The court's direction to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs for the restoration of the environment is also noteworthy, as it emphasizes the polluter pays principle.

The court's order is a reminder to all industries that they must take adequate measures to protect the environment and comply with the conditions of consent orders granted by the Pollution Control Board. Failure to do so can result in severe consequences, including the closure of the manufacturing unit and the imposition of hefty fines.
