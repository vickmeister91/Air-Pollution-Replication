The first court order pertains to an application filed by Rajendra Singh, Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Central Coal Fields, Ranchi, to quash the entire proceeding pending against him in connection with the Weights and Measures Case No. 18 of 1980. The case was related to the use of unstamped weighing scales in a coal dump of M/s. Bharat Coking Coal Limited, a Government of India Undertaking. Singh argued that he was not responsible for the offence committed by the company and that the case against him should be quashed.

The court examined the provisions of law and observed that if the offence under Section 25 of the Weights and Measures Act has been committed by a company, then every person who was in charge of or responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence shall be deemed guilty of the offence, provided he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence. The court also referred to previous court decisions related to similar offences.

Based on these observations, the court held that Singh, as the Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Central Coal Fields, was in a position of responsibility and management in the company and could be held liable for the offence committed by the company. The court, therefore, dismissed Singh's application to quash the case against him.

The second court order discusses various cases and their observations regarding the requirement of details in a complaint or report for taking cognizance of an offense. The court concludes that at the initial stage, it is sufficient to establish that the accused was in a position of responsibility or management in the company and that some offense has been committed. The court upholds the order of taking cognizance against the petitioner, who was mentioned as the managing director and manager in the complaint. However, the petitioner can still appear before the court and make a case for his innocence.

The third court order states that if the accused can prove their innocence and provide evidence to support their case, they may receive a favorable ruling. However, if they are unable to do so, they will face the consequences of the law for their offense.

Taken together, these court orders highlight the importance of establishing responsibility and management in cases of corporate offences. The law holds every person who was in charge of or responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence liable for the offence committed by the company, unless they can prove their innocence or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence. At the initial stage, it is sufficient to establish that the accused was in a position of responsibility or management in the company and that some offense has been committed. However, the accused can still appear before the court and make a case for their innocence. If they are unable to do so, they will face the consequences of the law for their offense.
