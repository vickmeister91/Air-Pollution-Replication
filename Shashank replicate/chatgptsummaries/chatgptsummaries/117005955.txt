In a recent court hearing, a petition was filed by Ramjan Sultan Rayma and another individual against the Union of India and four others regarding environmental regulations and waste disposal. The petitioners were seeking relief from the court in regards to the disposal of waste and the impact it was having on the environment. However, the court ultimately dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners had an alternative remedy available to them under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted by the Indian government to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the establishment of a Western Bench of the National Green Tribunal in Pune, which is the alternative remedy that the court referred to in its dismissal of the petition.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the petitioners had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal was specifically established to deal with cases related to environmental protection and conservation, and that the petitioners should have first approached the Tribunal before seeking relief from the court.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was not accompanied by any costs being awarded to either party. This means that neither the petitioners nor the respondents will be required to pay any legal fees or other costs associated with the case.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when seeking relief from the courts. In this case, the petitioners were required to first approach the National Green Tribunal before seeking relief from the court. Failure to do so resulted in the court dismissing the petition without awarding any costs to either party.
