The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Deepak Grit Udyog and others seeking to restrain the State of Haryana and its authorities from closing down their stone crushers situated around the city of Gurgaon. The petitioners argued that the closure of their stone crushers would result in a loss of livelihood for them and their employees. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it was an attempt by the wealthy section of society to sacrifice the health and welfare of thousands of people.

The court referred to an earlier judgment in Ishwar Singh v. State of Haryana and others, which had directed the closure and shifting of stone crushers to identified zones due to the health hazards they posed. The court noted that the present petitioners had not challenged the notifications imposing restrictions on stone crushers and that the matter was pending before the government for further decision. The court held that the present petition was barred by the principle of res judicata, which prevents a new decision or investigation on the same matter that has already been adjudicated.

The court also mentioned the general principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata, which are based on equity, justice, and good conscience. The principle of res judicata is based on the idea that a matter that has been finally decided by a competent court cannot be re-agitated by the same parties or their privies. The principle of constructive res judicata, on the other hand, applies when a matter that could have been raised in an earlier proceeding but was not, is deemed to have been decided in that proceeding.

The court concluded that the writ petition was not maintainable and was dismissed in limine. The court also mentioned that allowing stone crushers to continue their profession at a specified place, which affects the health and safety of people, cannot be equated with any fundamental right as enshrined in the Constitution of India.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the earlier judgment in Ishwar Singh v. State of Haryana and others, which had directed the closure and shifting of stone crushers to identified zones due to the health hazards they posed. The court's decision also highlights the importance of the principle of res judicata in preventing the re-litigation of matters that have already been decided by a competent court.

Furthermore, the court's decision emphasizes the need to balance the interests of different sections of society. While the petitioners argued that the closure of their stone crushers would result in a loss of livelihood for them and their employees, the court held that the health and welfare of thousands of people should not be sacrificed for the benefit of a few.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by M/S. Deepak Grit Udyog and others highlights the importance of the principle of res judicata in preventing the re-litigation of matters that have already been decided by a competent court. The court's decision also emphasizes the need to balance the interests of different sections of society and prioritize the health and welfare of the general public.
