The recent court order pertains to a building permit issued by a Panchayat for the construction of an Ayurvedic Health Centre in Kerala. However, the construction was later interdicted by the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority on the grounds that it was within the coastal management zone and therefore prohibited. The petitioner, in this case, filed a review petition before the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, New Delhi, seeking a direction to consider and pass orders on the matter.

The court has directed the National Coastal Zone Management Authority to consider and pass orders on the review petition within three months. Additionally, the court has ordered that status quo be maintained in respect of the construction until then. This means that the construction cannot proceed until the National Coastal Zone Management Authority has made a decision on the review petition.

The issue at hand is the construction of an Ayurvedic Health Centre within the coastal management zone. The coastal management zone is an area that is regulated by the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011. The notification aims to protect the coastal environment and restricts certain activities within the coastal zone. The construction of buildings within the coastal zone is one such activity that is restricted.

The petitioner, in this case, had obtained a building permit from the Panchayat for the construction of the Ayurvedic Health Centre. However, the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority interdicted the construction on the grounds that it was within the coastal management zone and therefore prohibited. The petitioner then filed a review petition before the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, seeking a direction to consider and pass orders on the matter.

The court has now directed the National Coastal Zone Management Authority to consider and pass orders on the review petition within three months. This means that the National Coastal Zone Management Authority will have to examine the matter and make a decision on whether the construction of the Ayurvedic Health Centre can proceed within the coastal management zone.

The court has also ordered that status quo be maintained in respect of the construction until the National Coastal Zone Management Authority has made a decision on the review petition. This means that the construction cannot proceed until the National Coastal Zone Management Authority has made a decision on the matter.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertains to the construction of an Ayurvedic Health Centre within the coastal management zone in Kerala. The construction was interdicted by the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority on the grounds that it was within the coastal management zone and therefore prohibited. The petitioner filed a review petition before the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, seeking a direction to consider and pass orders on the matter. The court has now directed the National Coastal Zone Management Authority to consider and pass orders on the review petition within three months and has ordered that status quo be maintained in respect of the construction until then.
