The Jharkhand High Court recently heard several writ petitions regarding the rejection of lease renewal applications by the Department of Industries, Mines and Geology, Government of Jharkhand. The petitioners argued that the exercise of such power by the State Government was not valid after the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2015 was enacted. The court considered the individual facts of each petitioner and their submissions, including compliance with environmental and forest clearance regulations. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners and ordered the renewal of their leases.

In another case, the court discussed a mining lease renewal and various allegations made against the lessee, including delay in obtaining environmental clearances and mining in safety zones beyond the lease hold area. The petitioner argued that the impugned order rejecting the renewal application is bad in law and that the M.M.D.R. Act, 1957 post 2015 amendment, does not contemplate any procedure for denying extension or rejecting applications for renewal or extension of the period of lease. The court also discusses various provisions of the M.M.D.R. Act and Rules and concludes that the State Government's denial of extension is completely unconnected to the scheme of the Act and Rules and is beyond the competence of the State.

The court also discussed the legal issues surrounding the extension of a mining lease. The petitioner's application for renewal of the lease was rejected, and they were asked to hand over the lease area to the Mines Department. The petitioner claims to have obtained all necessary clearances and compliance with lease conditions. The court considers the legal arguments of both the petitioner and the Union of India, including the interpretation of the Amendment Act, 2015. The court also refers to previous judgments on the subject.

The court notes that the amendment was made to address the delay in the renewal of mining leases, which had led to the closure of several mines. The court also notes that the amendment provides for the creation of a District Mineral Foundation and a National Mineral Exploration Trust. The court further discusses the provisions of Section 8A of the Act, which deals with the extension of mining leases. The court notes that the State Government cannot deny the benefit of deemed extension under Section 8A(5) and 8A(6) without following the procedure prescribed by law. The court also notes that the State Government has the power to take action for determination of the lease in terms of Rule 27(5) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, if the lessee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the lease.

The court also discussed two cases related to mining leases in Jharkhand. In the first case, the petitioner argues that the state government rejected renewal applications for mining leases in an arbitrary and illegal manner, citing examples of other states where leases were extended without such refusals. The state government argues that the petitioner violated various rules and conditions, including the Forest Conservation Act and environmental clearance requirements. In the second case, the petitioner seeks an extension of their mining lease, which was rejected by an inter-departmental committee. The petitioner argues that they have not operated the lease since 2011 and have obtained necessary approvals, while the state government argues that the petitioner has violated various rules and has not obtained necessary clearances.

The court also ruled that the Central Government Revisional Tribunal is not an independent and effective alternative forum, and that the impugned order violates principles of natural justice and errors of law. The court has also clarified that lessees who have not complied with the terms and conditions of the lease or have failed to obtain statutory clearances/compliance/consent to operate shall not be entitled to carry out mining operations and avail of the benefits of deemed extension. The State Government is required to give lessees an opportunity to satisfy that the terms and conditions of the lease have been complied with and that all postulated statutory clearances/compliances/consent have been obtained before carrying out mining operations.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court has made several rulings regarding the renewal and extension of mining leases in the state. The court has emphasized the importance of compliance with environmental and forest clearance regulations and has clarified the legal provisions surrounding the extension of mining leases. The court has also called for the Central Government to lay down specific guidelines/circular to be followed in a uniform manner in such matters.
