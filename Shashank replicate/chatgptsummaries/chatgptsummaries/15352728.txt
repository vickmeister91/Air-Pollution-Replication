In a recent case, a petitioner filed a writ petition seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash an order issued by the District Collector granting permission to the fifth respondent to construct a church in a prohibited area within the Coastal Regulation Zone. The petitioner argued that the construction was in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone notification and that no clearance was obtained from the competent authority.

The court, however, dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal. The court cited a previous judgment that environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal.

The Coastal Regulation Zone notification was issued in 2011 to regulate activities in the coastal zone and protect the coastal environment. The notification prohibits construction activities within 500 meters of the high tide line and restricts other activities within the coastal zone.

The petitioner argued that the construction of the church was in violation of the notification as it was being constructed within the prohibited area. The petitioner also argued that no clearance was obtained from the competent authority, which is required under the notification.

The court, however, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. The court cited a previous judgment in which it was held that environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 to handle environmental disputes and enforce environmental laws. The tribunal has the power to hear cases related to the protection of the environment, conservation of forests and other natural resources, and the prevention and control of pollution.

The court's decision to direct the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal is in line with the principle of judicial economy. The principle of judicial economy requires that courts should avoid hearing cases that can be better handled by other specialized tribunals.

In this case, the National Green Tribunal is better equipped to handle the environmental issues raised by the petitioner. The tribunal has the expertise and resources to assess the environmental impact of the construction of the church and determine whether it is in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone notification.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of protecting the coastal environment. The Coastal Regulation Zone notification was issued to protect the coastal environment and regulate activities in the coastal zone. The court's decision to direct the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal ensures that the environmental issues raised by the petitioner are properly addressed and that the coastal environment is protected.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petition and direct the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal is in line with the principle of judicial economy and highlights the importance of protecting the coastal environment. The National Green Tribunal is better equipped to handle environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act, and its expertise and resources ensure that environmental disputes are properly addressed.
