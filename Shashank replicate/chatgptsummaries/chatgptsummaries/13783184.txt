The case in question involves a petition filed by Sonam under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking monthly maintenance from her husband, Bhavneet Singh Arora. During the proceedings, Sonam filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. read with Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act to summon documents relating to the monthly income of her husband. However, the court rejected the application, stating that Sonam could produce the documents herself and that it was not proper to direct the respondent to produce the documents.

Sonam was not satisfied with the court's decision and filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. challenging the order. However, the court found no illegality in the order and dismissed the petition.

The issue at hand is whether the court's decision to reject Sonam's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was justified. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that any document produced for inspection in court must be authenticated if the court so requires.

In this case, Sonam argued that the documents relating to her husband's monthly income were necessary for the determination of the maintenance amount. However, the court rejected her application, stating that she could produce the documents herself. The court's decision was based on the principle that it is not proper to direct the respondent to produce the documents.

Sonam's criminal misc. petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. challenged the court's decision to reject her application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the court found no illegality in the order and dismissed the petition. This means that the court's decision to reject Sonam's application stands.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Sonam's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was based on the principle that it is not proper to direct the respondent to produce the documents. While Sonam argued that the documents were necessary for the determination of the maintenance amount, the court found that she could produce the documents herself. Sonam's criminal misc. petition challenging the court's decision was dismissed, meaning that the court's decision to reject her application stands.
