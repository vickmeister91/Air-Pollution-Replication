The Orissa High Court recently heard a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by local residents seeking the cancellation of a lease granted to the Sri Sri Ravishankar University Trust. The petitioners claimed that the trust was misusing the land and violating the terms of the lease, causing the government to lose revenue. However, the court found that the lease was granted following due procedure of law and that the petitioners had no locus standi to raise the issue. The court dismissed the petition, stating that it was an abuse of legal process.

The Sri Sri Ravishankar University Trust had been granted a lease for a piece of land in Orissa, India, on which it had established a university. The local residents, who had filed the PIL, claimed that the trust was misusing the land and violating the terms of the lease. They argued that the trust was using the land for commercial purposes, which was not allowed under the terms of the lease, and that this was causing the government to lose revenue.

The court, however, found that the lease had been granted following due procedure of law and that the petitioners had no locus standi to raise the issue. Locus standi refers to the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in court. In this case, the court found that the petitioners did not have the right to bring the PIL as they were not directly affected by the alleged misuse of the land.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claims of misuse of the land. The court found that the trust was using the land for educational purposes, as allowed under the terms of the lease, and that there was no evidence of any commercial activity on the land.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that it was an abuse of legal process. The court noted that the petitioners had filed the PIL without any basis and that it was an attempt to harass the trust. The court also noted that the petitioners had not followed the proper procedure for filing a PIL and had not obtained the necessary permission from the court before filing the petition.

In another case, the court had to consider an application filed under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. The application alleged that there had been a violation of fundamental rights due to air pollution caused by a factory in the area.

The court found that there was compliance with the Air Pollution Control Act and no contravention of fundamental rights. The court noted that the application was an abuse of legal process and that the court must protect society from such misuse. The court has a duty to enforce fundamental rights but also to ensure that the weapon under Article 32 is not misused.

The court dismissed the application and stated that the jurisdiction of the court should not be utilized for personal interest. The court noted that the application had been filed without any basis and that it was an attempt to harass the factory. The court also noted that the applicant had not followed the proper procedure for filing an application under Article 32 and had not obtained the necessary permission from the court before filing the application.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of following due process of law and not misusing the legal system for personal gain. The court noted that the legal system should be used to protect the rights of individuals and society as a whole, and not to harass or intimidate others. The court also emphasized the importance of obtaining the necessary permission from the court before filing a PIL or an application under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution.
