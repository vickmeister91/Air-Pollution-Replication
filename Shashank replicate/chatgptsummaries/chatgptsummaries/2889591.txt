The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Inder Singh under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bheem, District Rajsamand, dismissing his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner and another co-accused are facing criminal prosecution for various offences under IPC since 2000. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning fifteen documents, which was opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor. The learned trial Court examined the matter and declined the prayer by the impugned order. The court observed that while Section 91 Cr.P.C. clothes the criminal Court with the jurisdiction to summon documents, an accused cannot claim it as a matter of right. The court found that the learned trial Court had not committed any manifest error of law which has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The petition was dismissed.

The case in question involves a petition filed by Inder Singh, who is facing criminal prosecution for various offences under IPC since 2000. Singh had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning fifteen documents, which was opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor. The learned trial Court examined the matter and declined the prayer by the impugned order. Singh then filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bheem, District Rajsamand.

The court observed that while Section 91 Cr.P.C. clothes the criminal Court with the jurisdiction to summon documents, an accused cannot claim it as a matter of right. The court found that the learned trial Court had not committed any manifest error of law which has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The court further observed that the power to summon documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The court held that the learned trial Court had exercised its discretion judiciously in declining the prayer for summoning the documents.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The court held that the petitioner had failed to show that the impugned order was passed without jurisdiction or in violation of any principle of natural justice. The court further held that the petitioner had not shown that the impugned order had resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

The court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, where it was held that the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where the High Court is satisfied that the ends of justice require interference. The court held that the present case did not fall within the ambit of the Bhajan Lal case and that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for interference under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Inder Singh under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bheem, District Rajsamand, dismissing his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court held that the learned trial Court had not committed any manifest error of law which has resulted in a miscarriage of justice and that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for interference under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
