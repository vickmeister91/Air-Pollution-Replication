The court order in question pertains to a case where the question was raised whether a magistrate had the power to exercise Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) on a particular date. The magistrate in question had been invested with enhanced powers under Section 30 in Karnal District, but was later transferred to Gurgaon District without any fresh notification under Section 30. The court held that the magistrate's powers under Section 30 could not be assumed to extend to Gurgaon District without a fresh notification, and therefore his conviction of the petitioners under Section 307/34 of the Penal Code was in excess of his powers.

The case in question involved the conviction of the petitioners under Section 307/34 of the Penal Code by a magistrate who had been invested with enhanced powers under Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) in Karnal District. However, the magistrate was later transferred to Gurgaon District without any fresh notification under Section 30. The question before the court was whether the magistrate had the power to exercise Section 30 on a particular date in Gurgaon District.

The court held that the magistrate's powers under Section 30 could not be assumed to extend to Gurgaon District without a fresh notification. The court noted that Section 30 of the CPC provides for the appointment of a magistrate with enhanced powers to try certain cases in a particular area. The appointment of such a magistrate is made by the state government or the high court, and the notification appointing the magistrate specifies the area in which he or she is authorized to exercise the enhanced powers.

The court observed that the notification appointing the magistrate in question specified that he was authorized to exercise the enhanced powers under Section 30 in Karnal District. However, there was no fresh notification appointing him to exercise the enhanced powers in Gurgaon District. Therefore, the court held that the magistrate's powers under Section 30 could not be assumed to extend to Gurgaon District without a fresh notification.

The court further held that the magistrate's conviction of the petitioners under Section 307/34 of the Penal Code was in excess of his powers. The court noted that Section 307 of the Penal Code provides for punishment for attempt to murder, and Section 34 provides for punishment for acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention. The court observed that the magistrate had convicted the petitioners under these sections based on the evidence on record, but his conviction was in excess of his powers as he did not have the authority to exercise Section 30 in Gurgaon District.

In light of these findings, the court accepted the petition, set aside the previous orders, and directed that the petitioners be tried afresh in accordance with the law. The court's decision highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that magistrates are authorized to exercise enhanced powers in the areas where they are required to do so. It also underscores the need for magistrates to exercise their powers within the limits prescribed by law, and not to exceed their authority.
