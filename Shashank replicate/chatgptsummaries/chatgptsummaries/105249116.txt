The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a writ petition challenging an order passed by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board without giving any show cause notice to the petitioner. The order was passed on the basis of a complaint lodged upon the Chief Minister Helpline. The respondents argued that the order was appealable to the National Green Tribunal. The petitioner was running an industry without obtaining mandatory consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The Supreme Court had directed the Pollution Control Boards to issue notices to all industrial units requiring "consent to operate" to make their primary effluent treatment plants fully operational within three months. The court granted liberty to private individuals and organizations to address complaints to the concerned Pollution Control Board if any industry is in default. The court directed the concerned municipalities and/or local bodies to operate the existing common effluent treatment plants.

The court order also directs concerned municipalities and local bodies to evolve norms to recover funds for the purpose of generating finances to install and run common effluent treatment plants. The concerned state governments will supervise the process of evolving the norms and prioritize cities, towns, and villages that discharge industrial pollutants and sewer directly into rivers and water bodies.

The court also directs the setting up of sewage treatment plants and provides a rigid implementation mechanism for the directions. The concerned Pollution Control Board is directed to initiate civil or criminal action against defaulters, and private individuals and organizations can approach the National Green Tribunal for appropriate orders.

The court clarifies that the directions and time lines expressed in the order will not dilute any time lines and directions issued by courts or benches of the National Green Tribunal before. The court also requires each concerned state and union territory to make provision for an online, real-time, continuous monitoring system to display emission levels in the public domain.

In summary, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has issued a comprehensive order to address pollution control in the state. The court has directed the Pollution Control Boards to issue notices to all industrial units requiring "consent to operate" to make their primary effluent treatment plants fully operational within three months. The court has also granted liberty to private individuals and organizations to address complaints to the concerned Pollution Control Board if any industry is in default. The court has directed the concerned municipalities and/or local bodies to operate the existing common effluent treatment plants and to evolve norms to recover funds for the purpose of generating finances to install and run common effluent treatment plants.
