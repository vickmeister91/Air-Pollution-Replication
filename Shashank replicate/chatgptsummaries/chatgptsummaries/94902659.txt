The Indian judiciary has recently issued two court orders pertaining to the felling and cutting of trees in the state of Punjab. The first order was passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and restrained the entire state of Punjab from felling and cutting any tree. The order was challenged by Punj Lloyd Ltd. - VRC Construction (I) Pvt. Ltd. in a petition seeking its quashing. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without taking into account the projects that had been officially cleared and had the requisite sanctions.

The second order was passed by the Supreme Court of India, which suspended the ban on felling trees for four months to allow the state government to execute ongoing projects, including a highway, and to enable the government to provide information on trees removed and planted. The court left it open for the tribunal to pass any fresh orders on the projects already approved after considering the information provided by the state government. The parties involved can approach the tribunal to raise any contentions as may be open to them in law.

The NGT order was passed on 4th January 2021, in response to a petition filed by an environmental activist, Vikram Ahuja, who had sought a ban on tree felling in Punjab. The NGT had directed the state government to ensure that no trees were felled or cut in the state until further orders. The NGT had also directed the state government to submit a report on the number of trees felled or cut in the state in the last five years.

The petition filed by Punj Lloyd Ltd. - VRC Construction (I) Pvt. Ltd. sought the quashing of the NGT order on the grounds that it was passed without taking into account the projects that had been officially cleared and had the requisite sanctions. The petitioner argued that the NGT order had caused a delay in the execution of the projects, resulting in cost overruns and financial losses.

The Punjab government had also filed a civil appeal against the NGT order in the Supreme Court, seeking the vacation of the stay part of the order with respect to the ongoing project of widening National Highway No. 71. The Supreme Court had permitted the state government to approach the NGT for vacation of the stay part of the order.

The Supreme Court order, passed on 15th February 2021, suspended the ban on felling trees for four months to allow the state government to execute ongoing projects, including the widening of National Highway No. 71. The court also directed the state government to provide information on the number of trees removed and planted in the state in the last five years.

The court left it open for the NGT to pass any fresh orders on the projects already approved after considering the information provided by the state government. The parties involved can approach the tribunal to raise any contentions as may be open to them in law.

The court order has been welcomed by the Punjab government, which had argued that the NGT order had caused a delay in the execution of the projects, resulting in cost overruns and financial losses. The government has assured the court that it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the projects are executed in an environmentally sustainable manner.

The court order has also been welcomed by the construction industry, which had argued that the NGT order had caused a delay in the execution of the projects, resulting in cost overruns and financial losses. The industry has assured the court that it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the projects are executed in an environmentally sustainable manner.

The court order has been criticized by environmental activists, who had sought a ban on tree felling in Punjab. The activists have argued that the court order will lead to further destruction of the environment and will have long-term consequences for the state.

In conclusion, the court orders passed by the NGT and the Supreme Court of India pertaining to the felling and cutting of trees in Punjab have been the subject of much debate and controversy. While the orders have been welcomed by the construction industry and the Punjab government, they have been criticized by environmental activists. The court orders have highlighted the need for a balance between development and environmental sustainability, and the need for a transparent and accountable system for the execution of projects.
