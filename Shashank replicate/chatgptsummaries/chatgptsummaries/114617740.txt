In a recent court order, Ajendra was granted bail after being in custody since January 22, 2016, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The only allegation against Ajendra was that he had purchased 1 kilogram of beef, and the person from whom he purchased it had already been released on bail. The court allowed the bail application and directed Ajendra to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount for his appearance in the trial court.

The case against Ajendra was registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, which prohibits the killing, hunting, or capturing of any wild animal, including cows. The act also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any part of a wild animal, including beef. Ajendra was accused of purchasing 1 kilogram of beef, which is a violation of the act.

However, the court found that the only allegation against Ajendra was that he had purchased the beef, and the person from whom he purchased it had already been released on bail. The court also noted that Ajendra had been in custody for a significant amount of time and that there was no evidence to suggest that he posed a flight risk or that he would tamper with evidence.

Based on these factors, the court granted bail to Ajendra and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount for his appearance in the trial court. This means that Ajendra will be released from custody but will be required to appear in court for his trial.

The granting of bail to Ajendra is significant because it highlights the importance of ensuring that individuals are not held in custody for extended periods of time without sufficient evidence to support their detention. The court's decision to grant bail to Ajendra suggests that the judiciary is committed to upholding the rights of individuals and ensuring that they are not subjected to arbitrary detention.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Ajendra is a positive development in the ongoing efforts to protect the rights of individuals and ensure that they are not subjected to arbitrary detention. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that individuals are not held in custody for extended periods of time without sufficient evidence to support their detention. Overall, the court's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that justice is served and that the rights of individuals are protected.
