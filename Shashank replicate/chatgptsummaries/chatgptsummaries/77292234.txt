The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to a petitioner's request to call for documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). In the first case, the petitioner filed a petition to quash records in a private complaint filed by the respondent for offenses under the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner argued that the respondent had no locus standi to file the complaint as the power of attorney granted to him was revoked. The petitioner also filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for documents available in other cases to prove their defense. However, the respondent resisted the petition, stating that the petitioner had not provided substantial evidence to prove that the documents were necessary for deciding the case. The learned Magistrate dismissed the petition, and the petitioner filed a Criminal Original Petition, arguing that the Magistrate had made a grave error in rejecting the petition.

In the second case, the petitioner challenged their liability and the locus standi of the respondent to file and prosecute the case against them. They filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for records in other cases to prove their defense. The court has the power to summon any document if it finds it necessary or desirable in the interests of justice. However, the trial court must exercise its discretion properly and judiciously and not indulge in fishing or roving inquiry. The petitioner filed the petition to call for records to prove their defense.

The third court order discusses Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows for the production of necessary or desirable documents for investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings. The accused's entitlement to seek such an order typically comes at the stage of defense. The court allows the petitioner's request for relevant documents and directs the lower court to provide a copy to the petitioner for a fair chance to defend themselves. The order of the lower court is set aside, and the petitioner must adhere to the proper procedure when calling for records/documents.

In all three cases, the petitioners sought to call for documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to prove their defense. The court recognized the importance of allowing the accused a fair chance to defend themselves and acknowledged their entitlement to seek such an order at the stage of defense. However, the court also emphasized the need for the trial court to exercise its discretion properly and judiciously and not indulge in fishing or roving inquiry. The court set aside the lower court's order in the third case and directed the lower court to provide a copy of the relevant documents to the petitioner. 

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of allowing the accused a fair chance to defend themselves by providing them with relevant documents. However, the court also emphasizes the need for the trial court to exercise its discretion properly and judiciously when considering such requests. The court's decisions in these cases demonstrate a commitment to upholding the principles of justice and fairness in the legal system.
