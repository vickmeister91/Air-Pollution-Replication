The court has issued three separate orders related to mining activities in the state of Haryana. The first order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Sandeep Sangwan, seeking the quashing of an auction notice issued by the Director, Mines and Geology, Haryana, for the auction of minor mineral quarries for extraction of Boulder, Gravel, and sand for nine months. The petitioner argued that the proposed mining violated a notification issued by the Central Government requiring Prior Environmental Clearance (PEC) and a judgment of the court. The court found merit in the petitioner's argument and held that the State cannot act in violation of orders of the court or provisions of Environmental Protection law. The court directed the State to enforce the notification dated 14.9.2006 requiring prior environmental clearance for mining activities and monitor mining operations regularly and vigorously to bring them in conformity with the terms and conditions imposed while granting the prior environmental clearance.

The second order mandates that the State of Haryana must apply for determining the Terms of Reference and get the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report prepared for the entire mining area falling within the fragile Shivalik ranges of Himalayas. No public auction shall be held, and no license/contract/lease or right for extraction of minerals from the Shivalik ranges of Himalayas shall be granted by the State of Haryana until the final Environment Impact Assessment Report is prepared and made available as a public document to the prospective bidders. The Expert Appraisal Committee is directed to prepare the final Environment Impact Assessment Report within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the application from the State Government and thereafter to grant or reject the prior environmental clearance within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the application of the project proponent/successful bidders. The mining activities may continue till 28th February 2010, however, only on the basis of the contract/license granted to the highest bidders through a transparent public auction held after wide publicity and subject to the terms and conditions, as are imposed while granting a five-year contract and further subject to strict compliance of such terms and conditions.

The third order requires the Department of Industries and Commerce to identify an expert to conduct an environmental impact study within 90 days. The study must be submitted to the Punjab Pollution Control Board for consultation and then to the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority within 45 days. The Authority must appraise the project and submit recommendations to the State Expert Appraisal Committee within 60 days, and appropriate orders must be passed within 30-40 days. The State is restrained from proceeding with the auction of mining rights until environmental clearance is granted. The State can resubmit its application for clearance and follow the modified procedure permitted by the concerned authorities. The writ petition is disposed of.

In summary, the court orders aim to regulate mining activities in the state of Haryana and ensure compliance with environmental protection laws. The first order directs the State to enforce the notification requiring prior environmental clearance for mining activities and monitor mining operations regularly. The second order mandates the preparation of an Environment Impact Assessment Report for the entire mining area falling within the fragile Shivalik ranges of Himalayas before any mining rights are granted. The third order requires an environmental impact study to be conducted, and appropriate orders must be passed before any mining rights are granted. The court's orders aim to balance the economic benefits of mining with the need to protect the environment and ensure sustainable development.
