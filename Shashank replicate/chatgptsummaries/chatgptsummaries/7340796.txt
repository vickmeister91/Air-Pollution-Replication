The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the custody and disposal of property seized by police officers during investigations into criminal cases. The first order pertains to an application filed by Deepak Kumar Roy to quash an order rejecting his prayer for the release of his Bolero vehicle, which was seized by the police during an investigation into a case of robbery. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the petitioner had produced registration and insurance documents as well as tax token including Voter identity card in proof of the ownership of the vehicle. However, the court rejected the prayer for release of the vehicle on the ground that the insurance policy had expired and the petitioner did not submit his driving license. The court referred to relevant sections of the Cr.P.C. dealing with the custody and disposal of property pending trial and concluded that the vehicle could not be released.

The second court order discusses the procedure for the disposal or delivery of property seized by police officers, as well as the powers of the court to make appropriate orders regarding such property. The order also provides directions for the release of vehicles and goods during inquiry and trial, and emphasizes the need for prompt and judicious exercise of jurisdiction under section 451 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The order further directs measures to be adopted to safeguard the interest of the prosecution and provides additional directions for the custody and disposal of seized vehicles.

The third court order directs that seized vehicles should be released within 30 days of the application, with photographs taken and a panchnama prepared. The insurer must submit an undertaking to remit proceeds from the sale/auction of the vehicle if the rightful ownership does not vest with them. The court also directs state governments and police to ensure proper disposal of seized vehicles to prevent natural decay and theft of valuable parts. The order also notes that having a driving license is not a pre-condition for owning a vehicle and that the punishment for driving without a license is separate from the question of releasing a seized vehicle to its rightful owner. The order also highlights the necessity for insurance against third-party risk when using a motor vehicle in a public place.

The fourth court order states that no order can be made against an authority unless they have established and maintained a fund for meeting any liability arising from the use of their vehicles. Section 196 of the Act prescribes punishment for driving uninsured vehicles. The court believes that the vehicle in question should be released as it was insured until 5.8.2016 and the petitioner is willing to renew the insurance. The informant has not been made an opposite party and the Officer Incharge has admitted that the petitioner is the owner of the vehicle. The court orders for the release of the vehicle upon verification of the registration and renewed insurance papers, with a rider that the petitioner must take prior permission from the trial court if they wish to sell or modify the vehicle. The whole process should be completed within two weeks.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of following proper procedures for the custody and disposal of seized property, particularly vehicles. They also highlight the need for prompt and judicious exercise of jurisdiction by the court in such matters. The orders provide guidance on the release of seized vehicles, including the need for proper documentation and insurance, and the importance of safeguarding the interests of both the prosecution and the rightful owner of the vehicle. The orders also provide directions for the proper disposal of seized vehicles to prevent natural decay and theft of valuable parts. Finally, the orders emphasize the importance of having insurance against third-party risk when using a motor vehicle in a public place.
