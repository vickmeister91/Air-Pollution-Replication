In a recent court order, a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India was dismissed as maintainable. The petitioner had sought the issue of a writ of Certiorari to quash an order passed by the 12th respondent in Appeal No.95 of 2014 (SZ) and to allow the appeal. However, the court held that the remedy of the petitioner would be met only by appeal under Section 22 of the Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. Section 22 of the Act provides for appeals to the Supreme Court against the orders of the National Green Tribunal.

In the present case, the petitioner had approached the court seeking relief against an order passed by the 12th respondent in Appeal No.95 of 2014 (SZ). The details of the order and the nature of the relief sought by the petitioner are not mentioned in the court order. However, the court held that the petitioner's remedy lay only in an appeal under Section 22 of the Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition as maintainable is based on the principle of alternative remedies. This principle holds that if a statutory remedy is available to a person, they must exhaust that remedy before approaching the court for relief. This is because the legislature, in enacting a statute, is presumed to have provided for all the remedies that are necessary for the enforcement of the rights and obligations created by the statute.

In the present case, the Green Tribunal Act, 2010 provides for a specific remedy in the form of an appeal to the Supreme Court against the orders of the National Green Tribunal. Therefore, the court held that the petitioner must exhaust this remedy before approaching the court for relief.

It is important to note that the court did not award any costs in this case. Costs are awarded by the court to compensate the successful party for the expenses incurred in the litigation. In this case, since the writ petition was dismissed as maintainable, there was no successful party and hence no costs were awarded.

In conclusion, the court order in this case highlights the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before approaching the court for relief. The Green Tribunal Act, 2010 provides for a specific remedy in the form of an appeal to the Supreme Court against the orders of the National Green Tribunal. Therefore, if a person is aggrieved by an order of the National Green Tribunal, they must exhaust this remedy before approaching the court for relief.
