The court order pertains to a long-standing dispute between Dirk India Private Limited and Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (Mahgenco) over the disposal of Pulverized Fly Ash (PFA) generated at the Nashik Thermal Power Station. Dirk India specializes in recycling by-products generated by thermal power stations to manufacture cement replacement material. The dispute arose over the land allotted to Dirk India for installing their ash and processing plant and machinery, the construction and maintenance of the direct approach road, and shifting of high tension wires. Mahgenco terminated the agreement in 2006, and Dirk India filed a petition in court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for interim protection. The court allowed Dirk India to collect the PFA in the same manner before the termination notice was issued and restrained Mahgenco from dispossessing the plant and machinery of Dirk India. An Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, and both sides presented their version before the arbitrators.

The main issue in the arbitration was the termination of the agreement between the parties and the specific performance of the agreement. The court order pertains to two arbitration petitions filed by Dirk India and Mahgenco against each other, challenging an arbitral award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. The petitions were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment. The court emphasized that the scope of scrutiny under Section 34 of the Act is narrow and that the petitioner must bring its case within the available grounds to succeed. The court also discussed the grounds for challenging a judgment and decree, stating that a wider meaning of "public policy of India" is required in cases where the validity of an award is challenged. The order also explains that if an arbitrator passes an award that goes against the terms of a contract or violates statutory provisions, it can be set aside on the ground of "patent illegality." The court has jurisdiction to interfere with an award if it is erroneous on the basis of record with regard to proposition of law or its application.

The court order cites previous cases to support its conclusions. The court found that the responsibility of transporting PFA was solely on Dirk India, and that Mahgenco was not under any legal obligation to provide a delivery system without hoppers. The court also noted that the company had brazenly avoided its obligation to transport PFA and had even claimed that the responsibility was that of the power generation company. The court ultimately found that the power generation company had valid reasons for terminating the contract.

The court order discusses the grounds for challenging an arbitration award, including perversity in evidence, lack of dispute or difference, and internal contradictions. The case of ONGC Limited vs. Garware Shipping Corporation Limited is cited as an example of an award being set aside due to perverse conclusions and findings. The order also outlines the narrow compass within which the court must consider challenges to an award. The specific dispute in this case involves the interpretation of clauses in a contract regarding the erection and operation of a PFA handling plant. The petitioner argues that the arbitrators did not decide the real dispute in question and decided something which is not in dispute between the parties. The respondent argues that the petitioner's contentions are contrary to the contract and the award discloses no error of law.

The court order discusses a dispute between DIPL and MSEB regarding the delivery of PFA and the construction of silos and hoppers. The court notes that the responsibility of transportation of PFA was with DIPL, and the theory of amendment of the contract cannot be accepted without notice under Clause 11.2 of the contract. The court also notes that while an arbitral award need not be very detailed, reasons must be given in the award. The parties may choose an arbitrator with a technical or judicial background to decide the arbitration.

The court order states that parties in arbitration have the right to choose an arbitrator with a technical or judicial background, depending on their preferences for resolving the dispute. The expectations of the parties regarding the form and content of the award differ based on their choice of arbitrator. The court also notes that a delay in rendering the award may affect its outcome. The order discusses a specific case where the arbitrators failed to decide the core issues and rendered a perverse award. The court also mentions a counterclaim filed by Mahgenco seeking damages from Dirk India, which was dismissed by the arbitrators. Mahgenco challenged the dismissal, but the court found that the arbitrators' approach was not perverse.

The court order states that Mahgenco, a statutory body, cannot be deprived of claiming damages even if they complied with the orders of the High Court without challenging them. The Arbitrators were wrong in dismissing the claim of damages without looking into it. The correspondence produced by Mahgenco was official and should have been considered. The court allows the challenge to the award by both parties and sets aside the award under Section 34 of the Act.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a long-standing dispute between Dirk India and Mahgenco over the disposal of PFA generated at the Nashik Thermal Power Station. The court discussed the grounds for challenging a judgment and decree, stating that a wider meaning of "public policy of India" is required in cases where the validity of an award is challenged. The court also discussed the grounds for challenging an arbitration award, including perversity in evidence, lack of dispute or difference, and internal contradictions. The court
