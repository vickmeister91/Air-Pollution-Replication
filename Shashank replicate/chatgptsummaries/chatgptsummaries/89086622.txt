The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to Hotel Pause Dwelling House, which was challenged by the petitioner in court. The court directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable as per the existing Municipal laws, and the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court further directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In another case, the petitioner violated the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act by raising construction beyond the sanctioned plan and compoundable limits. The court ordered the petitioner to demolish or close the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. The court also noted that several similar cases have been filed and dealt with separately. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, which was permitted subject to the deposit of a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs. The court disposed of the case as withdrawn and all interim orders stand vacated.

The court orders in both cases highlight the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations related to construction and pollution control. The court has directed the petitioners to provide detailed information about the extent of construction carried out and the deviations made from the sanctioned plan. This information will help the court determine the appropriate course of action to be taken.

In the first case, the court has directed the petitioner to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This indicates the court's commitment to ensuring that environmental laws are followed and that pollution is controlled.

In the second case, the court has ordered the petitioner to demolish or close the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. This shows that the court is willing to take strict action against those who violate construction laws and regulations.

The court has also noted that several similar cases have been filed and dealt with separately. This suggests that there is a widespread problem of construction violations in the area and that the court is taking steps to address this issue.

Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of following statutory rules and regulations related to construction and pollution control. The court has directed the petitioners to provide detailed information about their construction activities and has taken strict action against those who have violated the law. These orders are a step towards ensuring that environmental laws are followed and that pollution is controlled in the area.
