The court order pertains to two separate cases involving mining and prospecting activities in certain areas. In the first case, M/S Ramgad Minerals and Mining Limited had filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari to quash a notification and a direction to the State to consider its applications for prospecting license and mining lease. The petitioner had applied for prospecting license and mining lease over portions of an area granted under reconnaissance permit. The State Government had granted prospecting license for gold for a period of three years over a certain area. The petitioner had also carried out detailed prospecting work and established availability of gold in the area. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved orders.

In the second case, a company had carried out prospecting work for gold in an area and had applied for a mining lease. However, the state government declared the area as a conservation reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act, which the company challenged in court. The company argued that the area did not meet the requirements for a conservation reserve and that the government had not applied its mind while issuing the notification. The court, however, ruled that the government had followed due procedure and that the notification was valid. The court dismissed the company's writ petitions.

The first case involves a dispute between M/S Ramgad Minerals and Mining Limited and the State Government over the grant of prospecting license and mining lease for gold in a certain area. The petitioner had applied for prospecting license and mining lease over portions of an area granted under reconnaissance permit. The State Government had granted prospecting license for gold for a period of three years over a certain area. The petitioner had also carried out detailed prospecting work and established availability of gold in the area. However, the State Government had not considered the petitioner's applications for mining lease and had instead granted the lease to another party.

The petitioner had challenged the State Government's decision in court and had sought a writ of certiorari to quash the notification and a direction to the State to consider its applications for prospecting license and mining lease. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved orders. The court is yet to deliver its final verdict in the matter.

The second case involves a dispute between a company and the State Government over the declaration of an area as a conservation reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act. The company had carried out prospecting work for gold in the area and had applied for a mining lease. However, the State Government had declared the area as a conservation reserve, which the company challenged in court.

The company argued that the area did not meet the requirements for a conservation reserve and that the government had not applied its mind while issuing the notification. The court, however, ruled that the government had followed due procedure and that the notification was valid. The court dismissed the company's writ petitions.

In conclusion, the court orders pertain to two separate cases involving mining and prospecting activities in certain areas. While the first case is still pending before the court, the second case has been decided in favor of the State Government. The court has upheld the government's decision to declare the area as a conservation reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act. These court orders highlight the importance of following due procedure and considering all relevant factors while granting licenses and leases for mining and prospecting activities.
