The case at hand involves a writ petition filed by Shri R.D. Sharma against St. John's High School, its management, Provincial Head, and Central Board of Secondary Education. The petitioner sought to quash the order terminating his services and reinstate him with all consequential benefits. The petitioner claimed that the respondent institute is performing the duties of the State and is performing an important public function. The respondents argued that the writ is not maintainable against a private institution that is not even aided by the government and is protected under Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution of India.

The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to various judgments before making a decision. The court order discusses the issue of whether a private educational institution can be held accountable through a writ of mandamus. The court cites various judgments and concludes that a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private institute if it performs a public duty, such as imparting education. However, if the dispute involves purely private service matters, the court will not issue a mandate.

In the present case, the petitioner's services were terminated, and the court finds that the matter is a private service issue and not a public duty matter. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed.
