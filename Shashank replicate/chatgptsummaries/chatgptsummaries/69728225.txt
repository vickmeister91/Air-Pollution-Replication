The writ petition was filed by Windsor Realty Pvt Ltd against various government bodies and individuals. Another writ petition was filed by M/s Nish Developers Pvt Ltd and Mr. Sanjay R. Bamboli against the State of Maharashtra. The details of the case and the parties involved are listed in the order.

In another court order, a group of writ petitions challenge a judgment and order passed by the National Green Tribunal.

The court has de-tagged one of the petitions and will hear it separately. The court has heard all the petitions and has reserved its judgment.

Another court order pertains to a writ petition challenging the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding the construction of a commercial and residential building in Goregaon, Mumbai. The NGT had dismissed the petitioner's application challenging the locus of the respondent and the limitation of the application. The court held that the writ petition challenging the NGT's order is maintainable before the High Court and that the petitioner had no alternative remedy available. The issue raised in the writ petition is of considerable importance.

The court order also pertains to a group of writ petitions that raise important questions about the powers of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the interpretation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has appointed a senior counsel as an Amicus Curiae to assist in the matter. The court needs to reconcile the conflicting interests of citizens who want to ensure compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects and do not want to be harassed by belated applications. The court needs to decide on the extent and scope of power that the NGT can exercise, the question of limitation, and whether the NGT can entertain an application that is in the nature of a public interest litigation (PIL). The court has heard all the counsels and perused the impugned orders.

Finally, the court order pertains to a case where the National Green Tribunal (NGT) brushed aside two judgments of the Coordinate Bench without giving reasons. The court found that the view taken by NGT Bench, Pune that the cause of action would arise from the date of knowledge of the original applicant about the alleged violation and secondly from the date on which Environmental Authorities do not take any action after violation is brought to their notice is not in accordance with law. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the Tribunal to decide afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The NGT was directed to decide all the issues within a period of three months.

In summary, the court orders listed pertain to various writ petitions challenging the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and other government bodies. The court needs to reconcile the conflicting interests of citizens who want to ensure compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects and do not want to be harassed by belated applications. The court needs to decide on the extent and scope of power that the NGT can exercise, the question of limitation, and whether the NGT can entertain an application that is in the nature of a public interest litigation (PIL). The court has heard all the counsels and perused the impugned orders and has reserved its judgment.
