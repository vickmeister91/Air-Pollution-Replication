The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a significant order in a group of writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest. The petitioners argued that the provision is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. They also challenged the government's notification declaring their mining leases as protected forest.

The State argued that the provision is necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. The court noted the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover and wildlife, and cited previous cases where the Supreme Court has intervened in public interest to protect these resources.

The court discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court also emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover and wildlife. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy. The court's decision to suspend mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology is a welcome move.

The court's decision to uphold the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area is also significant. This decision will help in preserving the forest cover and wildlife in the area. The court's dismissal of the writ petitions and leaving the parties to bear their own costs is also a fair decision.

Overall, the court's order is a step in the right direction towards protecting the environment and preserving forest cover and wildlife. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also commendable. The court's decision to suspend mining activities in certain areas and uphold the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area is a positive move.
