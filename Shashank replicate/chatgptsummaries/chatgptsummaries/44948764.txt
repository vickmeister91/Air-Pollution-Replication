The case in question involves a petition filed by the applicants under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. after their application under Section 457 of Cr.P.C. was dismissed for taking possession of a seized truck. The truck was transporting sand excavated from a prohibited area reserved for Sone Gadhyal Forest Century. The police registered a crime for the offense punishable under Section 379 of IPC and Sections 27, 29, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act 1972, under Sections 2, 41 and 52 of Indian Forest Act. The applicants claimed that they were not involved illegally and were falsely implicated in the case.

The court allowed the petition and directed the learned Court of JMFC Churhat District Sidhi to enquire from the concerned department whether the confiscation proceedings have been initiated or not and release the vehicle of the applicants till disposal of the case. This decision was made after considering the arguments put forth by the applicants and the facts of the case.

The applicants had argued that they were not involved in any illegal activity and were falsely implicated in the case. They claimed that they had purchased the sand from a person who had a valid permit to excavate sand from the area. They further argued that they had all the necessary documents and permits to transport the sand and were not aware that the area was a prohibited zone.

The court considered these arguments and found that there was no evidence to suggest that the applicants were involved in any illegal activity. The court also noted that the applicants had all the necessary documents and permits to transport the sand and were not aware that the area was a prohibited zone. Therefore, the court allowed the petition and directed the learned Court of JMFC Churhat District Sidhi to enquire from the concerned department whether the confiscation proceedings have been initiated or not and release the vehicle of the applicants till disposal of the case.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should not be punished for a crime that they did not commit. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the applicants were involved in any illegal activity and therefore, they should not be punished for a crime that they did not commit.

In conclusion, the court's decision to allow the petition and direct the learned Court of JMFC Churhat District Sidhi to enquire from the concerned department whether the confiscation proceedings have been initiated or not and release the vehicle of the applicants till disposal of the case was based on the principle of natural justice. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the applicants were involved in any illegal activity and therefore, they should not be punished for a crime that they did not commit.
