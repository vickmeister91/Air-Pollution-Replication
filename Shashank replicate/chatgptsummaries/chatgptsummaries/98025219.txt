The court order pertains to two petitions challenging the orders of the Joint Charity Commissioner-I, Maharashtra State, Mumbai rejecting the Petitioners' applications questioning the maintainability of proceedings under Section 41 E of the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, 1950 instituted by the Respondents. The Respondents had instituted proceedings under Section 41 E of the said Act complaining that the Trust property held by the Petitioners Trust is in danger of being wasted, damaged or improperly alienated and urging for appropriate measures by the Charity Commissioner. The Petitioners filed applications questioning the maintainability of proceedings under Section 41E of the said Act, in the form of applications dated 7 December 2011, inter alia, on the grounds that such proceedings were barred under the provisions of Order 23 Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), Order 2 Rule 2 of CPC or at least, principles analogous thereto. The court disposed of both petitions by common judgment and order.

The court order discusses the arguments made by both parties in a case involving applications dated December 7, 2011, and October 4, 2011, and their relation to the provisions of the CPC. The petitioner argues that the applications were barred under the provisions of Order 23 Rule 1 of CPC, and that the cause of action for both applications is the same. The respondent argues that the provisions of Order 23 Rule 1 of CPC are not applicable, and that there was no omission in seeking entire reliefs. The court does not address the issue of whether the provisions of CPC apply to the proceedings under the said Act, but ultimately rejects the petitioner's arguments and upholds the impugned orders.

The court order states that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) apply to proceedings under a certain Act, but in the present case, there is no reason to interfere with the impugned orders on the issue of maintainability of the proceedings. The court also refers to Order 23 Rule 1 of the CPC, which allows a plaintiff to withdraw a suit or abandon part of a claim, but in the present case, the bar under this rule is not attracted. The court cites a previous case where the same situation occurred and ruled that Order 23 Rule 1 of the CPC was not applicable.

The court order discusses the applicability of Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code in the present case and cites previous cases where it was held that the rule cannot be read to bar a suit that has already been instituted before another suit has been abandoned or dismissed. The court agrees with these views and notes that the application for withdrawal of the suit had stated the pendency of an earlier suit, and the respondent had objected only on the ground of payment of legal costs. The court infers that permission to withdraw the suit and institute a fresh one was impliedly granted based on the conduct of the parties and the order passed by the court. The order also cites a previous case where permission to institute a fresh case was impliedly granted when a previous case was withdrawn.

The court order discusses the issue of permission to institute a fresh case and states that such permission need not be expressed and can even be implied. The court also notes that the objection to maintainability of second applications by citing bar under Order 23 Rule 1 of CPC was rightly rejected by the Charity Commissioner. The order also discusses Order 2 Rule 1 and Rule 2 of CPC, which require every suit to include the whole of the claim to which the plaintiff is entitled in respect of any particular cause of action, but also allow the plaintiff to relinquish any part of their claim. However, if the plaintiff omits or intentionally relinquishes any portion of the claim, they cannot afterwards sue for that part or portion unless they have obtained leave of the court.

The court order discusses the provisions of Order 2 Rules 2 (2) and (3) of CPC, which deal with situations where a plaintiff omits or relinquishes a part of a claim or one out of several reliefs that they could have claimed in a suit. The order states that these provisions are not applicable in the present case, where the reliefs claimed in both applications are substantially the same. The court also notes that the object behind Section 41E of the said Act is to dispose of proceedings with utmost despatch and prevent the wasting, damaging, alienation, sale, removal, or disposition of Trust property. The court finds no jurisdictional error in making the impugned orders.

The court order pertains to the Charity Commissioner's power to issue injunction orders and the right of trustees or individuals to appeal against them. The order dismisses objections to the maintainability of an application made by three individuals claiming to have an interest in the matter. The court directs the Joint Charity Commissioner to dispose of the proceedings under Section 41E of the Act expeditiously within six months. The parties are directed to appear before the Joint Charity Commissioner and produce an authenticated copy of the order. The order also imposes costs of Rs. 10,000 on each petitioner to be paid to the respondents.

In summary, the court order pertains to two petitions challenging the orders of the Joint Charity Commissioner-I, Maharashtra State, Mumbai rejecting the Petitioners' applications questioning the maintainability of proceedings under Section 41 E of the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, 1950 instituted by the
