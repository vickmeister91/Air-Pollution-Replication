The case of Bhawani Singh v. Special Metropolitan Magistrate (N.I. Act Cases) No.3, Jodhpur Metropolitan, revolves around a criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioner, Bhawani Singh, under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the trial court. The trial court had dismissed Singh's application under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C., which sought to produce the record in respect of the registered notice and to summon Rawal Ram for giving his evidence. The court had observed that the documents sought to be summoned and evidence of Rawal Ram were neither necessary nor desirable for the just decision of the case.

Singh had approached the High Court, challenging the trial court's decision. However, the High Court found no illegality in the trial court's decision and dismissed the petition. The court held that the trial court had rightly rejected Singh's application under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. as the documents and evidence sought were not necessary for the just decision of the case.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. gives the court the power to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, even if he has not been summoned as a witness or if his examination is not required at that stage.

In this case, Singh had sought to produce the record in respect of the registered notice and to summon Rawal Ram for giving his evidence. However, the trial court had rejected his application, stating that the documents and evidence sought were not necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case. The court had observed that the evidence of Rawal Ram was not relevant to the case and that the documents sought to be summoned were already on record.

Singh had argued before the High Court that the trial court had erred in rejecting his application under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. He had contended that the documents sought to be summoned were necessary for the just decision of the case and that the evidence of Rawal Ram was crucial to establish his innocence.

However, the High Court did not find merit in Singh's arguments and upheld the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court had rightly rejected Singh's application as the documents and evidence sought were not necessary for the just decision of the case. The court observed that the trial court had considered all the relevant factors before passing the order and that there was no illegality or irregularity in the decision.

In conclusion, the case of Bhawani Singh v. Special Metropolitan Magistrate (N.I. Act Cases) No.3, Jodhpur Metropolitan, highlights the importance of Section 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. in criminal proceedings. While these provisions give the court wide powers to summon documents and witnesses, the court must exercise these powers judiciously and only when it is necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case. In this case, the trial court had rightly rejected Singh's application under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. as the documents and evidence sought were not necessary for the just decision of the case. The High Court had upheld the trial court's decision, emphasizing the need for courts to exercise their powers judiciously and in accordance with the law.
