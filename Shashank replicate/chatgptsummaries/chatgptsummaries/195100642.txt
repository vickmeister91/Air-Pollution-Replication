The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petition sought direction to the trial court to comply with an order passed by the High Court in 2010. The petitioners in this case were convicted for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act and sentenced to three years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 for each offence.

The High Court, in its order, reduced the jail sentence to the period already undergone, subject to depositing a further fine of Rs. 7,500 each within two months. However, as the petitioners failed to deposit the fine amount, they were arrested and sent to jail.

The petitioners then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking direction to the trial court to comply with the High Court's order. The trial court, however, refused to comply with the High Court's order and sent the petitioners to jail for serving out the remaining sentence.

The petitioners argued that the trial court had erred in not complying with the High Court's order. They contended that the High Court's order was binding on the trial court and that the trial court had no discretion to disregard it.

The trial court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that it had not committed any error in sending the petitioners to jail for serving out the remaining sentence. The court held that the High Court's order was conditional and that the petitioners had failed to comply with the conditions of the order. Therefore, the trial court was justified in sending them to jail.

The petitioners then appealed to the High Court, challenging the trial court's order. The High Court, in its order, held that the trial court had erred in not complying with its order. The High Court observed that its order was clear and unambiguous and that the trial court had no discretion to disregard it.

The High Court further held that the trial court's order was based on a misinterpretation of its order. The High Court clarified that its order was not conditional and that the petitioners were entitled to the benefit of the reduced sentence as soon as they deposited the fine amount.

The High Court, therefore, set aside the trial court's order and directed it to comply with its order. The High Court also directed the trial court to release the petitioners from jail as soon as they deposited the fine amount.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking direction to the trial court to comply with an order passed by the High Court in 2010. The High Court had reduced the jail sentence of the petitioners subject to depositing a further fine of Rs. 7,500 each within two months. As the petitioners failed to deposit the fine amount, they were arrested and sent to jail. The trial court had refused to comply with the High Court's order and sent the petitioners to jail for serving out the remaining sentence. However, the High Court set aside the trial court's order and directed it to comply with its order. The High Court also directed the trial court to release the petitioners from jail as soon as they deposited the fine amount.
