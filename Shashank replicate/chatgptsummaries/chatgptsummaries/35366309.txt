The court recently acquitted Sat Prakash of charges under sections 332/461 of the DMC Act for unauthorized construction without the previous sanction of the Commissioner of MCD. The prosecution had presented three witnesses, but the accused did not cross-examine any of them. The court held that the prosecution had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had erected or commenced to erect the unauthorized construction. The court cited a previous case that held that the mere presence of a person at the spot may not satisfy the requirement for finding them guilty.

The court order states that in order to prove an offense under the DMC Act, the accused must have either erected or commenced to erect the unauthorized construction. Mere presence at the spot is not enough. The prosecution for the offense cannot be held except upon the complaint of an officer of the Corporation not below the rank of a Deputy Commissioner. In this case, the prosecution failed to follow the procedure as prescribed under section 467 of the Act. The accused is acquitted as the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and providing sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to establish that the accused had erected or commenced to erect the unauthorized construction, and the court cited a previous case to support its decision. The mere presence of a person at the spot is not enough to find them guilty of an offense under the DMC Act.
