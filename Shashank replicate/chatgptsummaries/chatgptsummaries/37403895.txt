The Chittorgarh Fort, a protected ancient monument under the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, has been the subject of several court orders regarding its preservation and protection from mining and blasting activities. The court orders have been filed in public interest to protect the fort, which has been declared an ancient monument of national importance due to its historical, archaeological, and architectural significance.

In 2002, a court order directed that no mining operation should take place within six kilometers of the fort's boundary wall, and no blasting operation should be allowed within a 5-kilometer radius of the wall. However, several mining leases have been granted within 1.5 kilometers of the fort, and blasting operations are causing damage to the fort's structures and nearby houses. The Archaeological Survey of India admits that cracks have occurred in some places, but it cannot be determined if they are due to blasting or other reasons.

In response to a petition seeking directions to the Archaeological Survey of India to protect the fort, stop blasting within 10 km of the boundary wall, and cancel licenses/leases granted for open blasting, the court noted the historical and architectural significance of the fort and declared it an ancient monument of national importance. The court ordered that mining and blasting activities within a 5 km radius of the fort should be stopped to preserve and conserve the structure.

However, in another court order, the court considered the responses of the State, Mining Department, and Birla Cement, which argued that their activities are not causing harm to the Fort. The court ultimately dismissed the petition. In yet another court order, the court found that mining operations and blasting have caused damage to the fort and nearby structures, and new mining leases are adding to the problem. The court ordered a fresh report from the Indian Bureau of Mines and recommended restrictions on the amount of explosive used during mining operations to protect the fort.

The court also recommended supervision and monitoring of blasting operations and the maintenance of records of each blast. The court recommended that the maximum charge per hole should not exceed 0.125 kg, the diameter of blast holes should be 33 mm and should not exceed 0.75 m depth, not more than 10 holes are to be blasted in a single round, each hole should be fired separately using safety fuse, safety operating procedures given by DGMS are to be strictly adopted, and the blasting time for each quarry should be specified and each quarry should strictly follow this blasting time.

In another court order, the court prohibited mining operations within 6 km of the Chittorgarh Fort and banned blasting operations within 5 km of the Fort wall. The Archaeological Survey of India expressed concern that mining operations could cause irreparable damage to the monument due to vibrations from explosives. The court directed the ASI and Geological Survey of India to conduct a study on the effects of mining operations within a 10 km radius of the Fort.

The GSI report found that seismic vibrations were recorded at the Fort site due to blasting at a nearby mine and recommended long-term monitoring of the impact of blasting. Blasting operations within 10 km of the Fort were stayed until further directions. The court also ordered continuous monitoring of mining operations and the fitting of tell-tale mirrors to study the behavior of cracks.

In yet another court order, the court found that mining and blasting operations within 10 km of the fort wall should be restrained as they are causing severe damage to the fort structures and have adverse effects on the environment. The court also noted that there is no method of monitoring available in the Mining Department and the State of Rajasthan for checking the assessment of blasting operations.

The court ordered a stop to all mining operations within 10 km of the fort wall, as the safety of the ancient monument cannot be left at the mercy of the mining operators. The court also rejected the argument that Birla Cement should not be held responsible for the damage, as it is a cumulative effect of all mining operations and blasting. The court emphasized that the safety of the ancient monument cannot be compromised for the sake of mining activities and blasting.

In conclusion, the court orders regarding the preservation and protection of the Chittorgarh Fort highlight the importance of sustainable development and the need to protect historical monuments and the environment. The court has ordered the relocation of industries from the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) if they do not switch to natural gas as an industrial fuel and has constituted a Monitoring Committee to monitor eco-restoration efforts in the Aravalli Hills. The court has also enforced the "polluter-pays principle" and the precautionary principle to prevent environmental degradation. The court has ordered a ban on mining operations within a 10-kilometer radius of the fort and the cancellation of mining leases granted within that area. The court has also awarded compensation for damages caused to the structures of the fort, houses, and ecology.
