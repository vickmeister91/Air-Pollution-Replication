The petitioner had been granted a mining lease over an area of 98 acres of land for extracting iron ore in 1960, which expired in 1990. The petitioner had applied for renewal of the lease, which was granted in 2003 for a period of 20 years. The petitioner continued mining operations until the lease expired in 2010. The third respondent, Deputy Conservator of Forests, issued notices to the petitioner to stop mining operations and hand over possession of the leased area.

The court reserved its order on the matter.

The court found that the lease had expired and the petitioner had stopped mining operations. The court also found that the petitioner was not entitled to automatic extension of the lease and that the notices issued by the third respondent were valid. The court dismissed the writ petition.
