The Bombay High Court recently heard a case involving the use of electric power for processing effluent water before its dispersal, and whether this could be considered a manufacturing process under the Employees' State Insurance Act. The case involved a cooperative processors society engaged in bleaching, dyeing, and mercerising grey cloth, which required the use of water that had to be treated before discharge into the river basin. The court examined various definitions and previous cases to determine whether the use of power was an integral part of the manufacturing process. Ultimately, the court found that the treatment of the water was not part of the manufacturing process and therefore the society was not covered under the E.S.I. Act.

The court order states that a society engaged in bleaching, dyeing, and mercerizing of grey-cloth used power for treating effluent before discharging it into the Krishna River basin. However, the treatment of water was not a part of the manufacturing process, and the manufacturing process could be carried out without hindrance even without the operation of the motor used to work the plant that treated the effluent. Therefore, the use of power was not for any manufacturing process of the society's factory. The appeal was dismissed, and parties were left to bear their own costs.
