The first court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The appellant had challenged an order passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, which had granted an amount of Rs.19,000/- per month as interim relief for alternative accommodation for the petitioners from the date of application till disposal of the main petition. The appellant had argued that the order was not in accordance with the law and that an enquiry was mandatory to dispose of the application filed under Section 19(1)(f) of D.V. Act.

The court found that an enquiry was necessary and that the order was not sustainable under law. The court also found that the direction sought in I.A.III was not required for the decision of the appeal. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had not conducted an enquiry before passing the order, which was against the principles laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. The court held that the learned Magistrate had erred in granting the interim relief without conducting an enquiry and set aside the order.

The second court order pertains to a case under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Domestic Violence Act. The court had previously granted maintenance to the petitioners, and they had filed an application for rent for alternative accommodation. The learned Magistrate had granted the rent without conducting an enquiry, which was against the principles laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka.

The court found that the order was not sustainable under law and set it aside. The matter was remanded to the learned Magistrate to decide the application afresh by holding an enquiry in accordance with the law. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had not followed the principles laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and had granted the rent without conducting an enquiry. The court held that the learned Magistrate had erred in granting the relief without conducting an enquiry and set aside the order.

In both the court orders, the learned Magistrate had granted relief without conducting an enquiry, which was against the principles laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. The court held that an enquiry was necessary to dispose of the application filed under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the Hindu Marriage Act. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had erred in granting the relief without conducting an enquiry and set aside the order.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of conducting an enquiry before granting relief under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the Hindu Marriage Act. The court has laid down clear principles for conducting an enquiry and has emphasized the need to follow these principles while granting relief. The court has also emphasized the need to ensure that the relief granted is in accordance with the law and is sustainable under law.
