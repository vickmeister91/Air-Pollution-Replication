The court order in question relates to a case between Kadel Finance Company and Manish. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the learned Civil Judge & Judicial Magistrate, Sujangarh, in the complaint case of 37/2012. The court has modified the order to the extent of the deletion of the word "registered document of finance company" from the list of documents to be submitted. The order also states that the guarantor can accomplish his liability if he desires to do so. The present misc. petition is disposed of.

To provide some context, Kadel Finance Company had filed a complaint against Manish for non-payment of a loan. The company had claimed that Manish had taken a loan of Rs. 5,00,000 and had failed to repay it. The company had also claimed that Manish had provided a registered document as security for the loan. However, Manish had denied taking the loan and had claimed that he had never provided any security document to the company.

The case had gone to the Civil Judge & Judicial Magistrate, Sujangarh, who had ordered Manish to submit various documents, including the registered document of the finance company, to prove his case. Manish had then filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. in the High Court, challenging this order.

The High Court, after hearing both parties, has modified the order to the extent of deleting the requirement for the registered document of the finance company. The court has held that the document is not necessary for the case and that Manish can prove his case through other means. The court has also stated that the guarantor can fulfill his liability if he wishes to do so.

This court order is significant as it clarifies the requirements for proving a case of non-payment of a loan. The court has held that a registered document of the finance company is not necessary for proving the case and that other evidence can be used. This is important as it makes it easier for borrowers to defend themselves against false claims of non-payment.

Furthermore, the court's statement that the guarantor can fulfill his liability if he wishes to do so is also significant. This means that the guarantor has the option to pay off the loan if the borrower fails to do so. This is important as it clarifies the role of the guarantor in such cases and provides a clear option for them to fulfill their obligations.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between Kadel Finance Company and Manish is significant as it clarifies the requirements for proving a case of non-payment of a loan and provides a clear option for the guarantor to fulfill their obligations.
