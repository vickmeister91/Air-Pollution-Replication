The Gujarat High Court recently heard a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case filed by petitioners seeking various reliefs related to the removal of bunding of Surajbari Creek and Cheravadi Sub-creek in a particular village in Kutch district. The petitioners had sought directions to the authorities to remove the bunding and to take appropriate action against the persons responsible for the same. They had also sought compensation for the damage caused to the environment and the loss of livelihoods of the local fishermen.

The court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the obstructions had been removed and that the petitioners could pursue appropriate remedies under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court observed that the authorities had already taken action to remove the bunding and that the petitioners had not produced any evidence to show that the obstructions still existed. The court also stated that the Green Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine compensation and that the petitioners could approach the Tribunal for the same.

The court further observed that the petitioners had not made any specific allegations against any particular person or authority and that they had only made general allegations. The court stated that the petitioners should have made specific allegations against the persons responsible for the bunding and that they should have produced evidence to support their allegations.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not approached the authorities concerned before filing the petition and that they had not exhausted the remedies available to them under the law. The court stated that the petitioners should have first approached the authorities concerned and given them an opportunity to take appropriate action before approaching the court.

The court further observed that the petitioners had not produced any evidence to show that they had suffered any loss or damage as a result of the bunding. The court stated that the petitioners had only made general allegations and that they had not produced any specific evidence to support their claims.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not made any prayer for compensation in their petition and that they had only sought directions for the removal of the bunding and for taking appropriate action against the persons responsible for the same. The court stated that the petitioners could not seek compensation without making a specific prayer for the same.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the obstructions had been removed and that the petitioners could pursue appropriate remedies under Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court also stated that the Green Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine compensation and that the petitioners could approach the Tribunal for the same. No costs were awarded.
