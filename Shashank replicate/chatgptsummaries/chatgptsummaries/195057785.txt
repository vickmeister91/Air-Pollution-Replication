The court order pertains to two main issues related to mining activities in the districts of Bellary, Chitradurga, and Tumkur of Karnataka. The first issue concerns the objection of mining lessees to continue paying 10% of the sale proceeds of mining to the Monitoring Committee for transfer to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that has been constituted to implement the Comprehensive Environment Plan for the Mining Impact Zone. The second issue pertains to the creation of the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) under Section 9B of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2015.

The Federation of Indian Mining Industry, Southern Region (FIMI-Southern Region) has prayed for clarification of earlier orders of the court to the effect that iron ore lessees in Karnataka will no longer be required to contribute 10% of the sale proceeds to the Monitoring Committee or the SPV from the date of which said lessees have become liable to make payment to the DMF. However, the Union of India and the State of Karnataka have opposed the grant of any relief/clarification, as prayed for by FIMI-Southern Region.

The court order requires existing lessees to pay 10% of their sale proceeds to the Monitoring Committee/SPV for the purpose of restitution due to the destruction of the environment caused by mining activities. The court also dismisses Interlocutory Application No. 247 and connected applications. The court approves the CEPMIZ scheme, which is to be implemented through the Special Purpose Vehicle, Karnataka Mining Environment Restoration Corporation (KMERC). The scheme includes works for socio-economic development and integrated mining and railway infrastructure, industrial infrastructure, and medical infrastructure. The total cost projected and the source of funds are outlined in a chart.

The court order outlines various expenses and contributions made by the SPV towards different sectors. These include woman and child welfare, forest and ecology, skill development, tourism, conveyor belt system and railway sidings, Tumkur-Chitradurga-Davanagere railway line, industrial infrastructure, and medical infrastructure. The SPV is contributing a total of 7,142.35 crore rupees towards these sectors, with specific amounts allocated for each project. The contributions are either completely borne by the SPV or shared with the lessees.

The court has ordered that a sum of 250 crore rupees be earmarked for the maintenance of medical infrastructure at the Aynagar Institute of Medical Sciences in Bellary. The court has also approved the Comprehensive Environmental Plan for the Mining Impact Zone, which will cost a total of 15,742.35 crores over a period of 10 years. However, there is a shortfall of 1,560 crores, which will be made up by cost savings and reduction in project cost. The court has approved the scheme with certain conditions and suggestions made by the CEC and the learned Amicus Curiae. The objections of the FIMI-Southern Region relate to the broad and vague nature of the scheme.

The court order pertains to objections raised by FIMI-Southern Zone regarding the Comprehensive Environmental Plan for Mining Impact Zone (CEPMIZ) presented to the court. FIMI-Southern Zone objects to the broad, sketchy and vague nature of the scheme and the fact that it goes beyond the contours of the court's order. The State of Karnataka has suggested raising the cap on production from 30 MMT to 40 MMT and thereafter to 50 MMT. The court has reserved its views on the matter until more comprehensive details are available. It has approved the construction of the conveyor belt system, railway sidings and railway sub-lines, but has held back its views on other measures until more details are available. The court has called upon the State of Karnataka and the CEC to submit a detailed proposal with regard to implementation of the scheme.
