The court order in question involves multiple cases, including CRL.M.C. 671/2016, CRL.M.C. 672/2016, CRL.M.C. 1317/2016, CRL.M.C. 1319/2016, and CRL.M.C. 1321/2016, between petitioners and respondents represented by various lawyers. Unfortunately, the details of the cases are not provided in the summary. 

Another case discussed in the court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed against several individuals, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, for alleged fraud, cheating, and other offenses related to the National Herald newspaper. The Trial Court had summoned the accused persons, and during the pre-charge evidence stage, the complainant moved two applications under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to summon documents, which were allowed by the Trial Court. The accused persons filed several petitions challenging these orders, arguing that they were passed without due application of mind and without giving notice or opportunity of hearing to the petitioners. The court heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court states that a notice must be given to a person against whom a proposed action is to be taken and that the right of affording opportunity of hearing is a principle of natural justice that cannot be denied. The court also discusses the summoning of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and states that the document means legally permissible document either in the shape of original document or in the shape of copy duly authenticated. The court further states that the photocopy cannot be termed as a document as neither it is original nor it is authenticated without any person authenticating the same. The court concludes that the orders passed in the present case do not reflect any necessity or desirability to summon the documents.

The court order also states that a summons or written order can be issued to a person believed to have possession of relevant documents for a criminal investigation. The power given under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a general and wide power that can be exercised by the court if it considers the summoning of such documents or things necessary or desirable. The party requesting the summons must demonstrate that the production of the document is material for arriving at a just decision in the case. The court has to deal with this issue to satisfy itself as regards to the necessity or desirability of the documents sought to be produced. The section has inherent limitations as to the stage or point of time of its exercise, commensurately with the nature of the investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings.

The court order also discusses the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of determining the necessity and relevance of such evidence and ensuring that it is required at the relevant stage of the proceedings. The order also notes that the principle of natural justice requires that parties be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before any judicial order is passed. The court finds that the orders in the present case were passed in a casual manner without proper consideration of these requirements and principles.

The court order also states that the High Court cannot pass a judicial order directing an investigation against a person or organization without providing them with a reasonable opportunity to be heard, especially when such an order can affect their reputation. The order also mentions that if a judgment is pronounced without jurisdiction or in violation of natural justice, it can be recalled. The right to be heard is important as it allows individuals or groups to participate in the decision-making process. The order also refers to a case where the complainant argues that notice is not mandatory before passing an order under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., but the court disagrees and states that the notice is necessary.

Finally, the court order discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The learned Magistrate had observed that there were no materials before him to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application was desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial. The High Court had interfered with the discretion conferred on the trial courts in the matter of summoning documents, which would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time. The court set aside the orders dated 11.01.2016 and 11.03.2016 and held that while passing the order under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents, if the other party has already joined the proceedings, it is entitled to be heard. The right of the complainant shall not be curtailed in any circumstance to move the fresh application during the pendency of the proceedings before the Court below.

In summary, the court order discussed multiple cases involving petitioners and respondents represented by various lawyers. The court discussed the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court also discussed the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings and the importance of determining the necessity and relevance of such evidence. The court emphasized the need for parties to be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before any judicial order is passed. Finally, the court discussed the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of
