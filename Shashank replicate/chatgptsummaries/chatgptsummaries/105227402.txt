The Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) has been a subject of concern for environmentalists and activists for several years. The plant, located in Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, has been accused of operating without obtaining necessary environmental clearances and posing a threat to the safety of the surrounding areas in the event of a natural disaster. In this context, three court orders have been issued, which we will discuss in this article.

The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by an advocate associated with a public trust for environmental protection. The petitioner had raised concerns about the safety of the MAPS plant and the storage of spent fuel. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that all safety measures were in place and that the petitioner lacked bona fide, as he had previously filed a writ petition against the establishment of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and dismissed the writ petition. The court noted that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) had conducted a safety review of the MAPS plant and had found that all necessary safety measures were in place. The court also observed that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claims about the safety of the plant. The court further noted that the petitioner's previous writ petition against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project had been dismissed by the court, which raised questions about the petitioner's bona fide.

The second court order discusses a civil appeal challenging the vires of the Atomic Energy (Safe Disposal of Radioactive Wastes) Rules, 1987. The court cites a previous judgment that outlines the safe management of radioactive waste and the regulations in place for the disposal of such waste. The court also addresses concerns about the safety of the MAPS Units I and II, stating that necessary measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the plant and that no environmental clearance is required for its operation.

The court notes that the AERB has asked for further details regarding the possibility of a submarine volcano in the area and that work is in progress to address any potential risks. The court also observes that the AERB has conducted periodic safety reviews of the MAPS plant and has found that all necessary safety measures are in place. The court concludes that the appeal lacks merit and dismisses it.

The third court order dismisses a writ petition expressing apprehension about the functioning of MAPS Units I and II at Kalpakkam due to the possibility of a submarine volcano eruption. The court notes that safety measures are in place and directs the concerned authorities to ensure all safety mechanisms are in place in case of any unforeseen mishap or disaster. The court concludes that the apprehension expressed by the petitioner is unfounded and dismisses the writ petition.

In summary, the three court orders related to the MAPS plant in Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, have dismissed the concerns raised by environmentalists and activists about the safety of the plant. The court has noted that all necessary safety measures are in place and that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board has conducted periodic safety reviews of the plant. The court has also observed that the concerns raised by the petitioners lack merit and that there is no evidence to support their claims.
