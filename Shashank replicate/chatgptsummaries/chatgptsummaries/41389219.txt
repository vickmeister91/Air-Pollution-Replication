The State of Kerala appealed against a judgment by the High Court of Kerala that affirmed the order of the District Judge, Thrissur, dismissing the revision petition filed by the State of Kerala. The case involved the confiscation of a vehicle used for illegally transporting ivory collected from the forest. The High Court found that ivory is not a "forest produce" coming under Section 2(b) of the Kerala Forest Act, 1961, and no forest offense can be said to have been committed in respect of ivory. The Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the High Court's decision, stating that ivory is not considered a forest produce under the Act.

The court order states that after the enactment of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, ivory cannot be considered a forest produce, and possession and transportation of ivory without valid authority is not an offense punishable under the Act. The definition of forest produce in Section 2(f) of the Act does not include ivory. Therefore, the action taken under Section 61A of the Act, which deals with confiscation of property in case of forest offenses, cannot be supported. The court also states that the seizure of ivory is not justified under Section 52 of the Act, and the power of confiscation under Section 61A commences only when a valid seizure of the property is effected under the Act. The court dismisses the appeal and states that there is no justification for the seizure and order of confiscation of the vehicle.

The State of Kerala had argued that the ivory was obtained from the forest and therefore, it should be considered a forest produce. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, supersedes the Kerala Forest Act, 1961, and specifically excludes ivory from the definition of forest produce. The court also noted that the possession and transportation of ivory without valid authority is punishable under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and not under the Kerala Forest Act, 1961.

The court further stated that the seizure of the vehicle used for transporting the ivory was not justified under Section 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, as the vehicle was not used for committing any offense under the Act. The court also noted that the power of confiscation under Section 61A of the Act commences only when a valid seizure of the property is effected under the Act. As the seizure of the ivory was not justified under the Act, the court held that there was no justification for the seizure and order of confiscation of the vehicle.

The court's decision in this case clarifies the legal position regarding the possession and transportation of ivory in India. The court has held that ivory cannot be considered a forest produce under the Kerala Forest Act, 1961, and that the possession and transportation of ivory without valid authority is punishable under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has also clarified that the power of confiscation under Section 61A of the Act commences only when a valid seizure of the property is effected under the Act. This decision is likely to have significant implications for the enforcement of wildlife protection laws in India.
