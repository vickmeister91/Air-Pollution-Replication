In 1996, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgment in response to a public interest petition against tanneries located in the city of Kanpur. The scope of the petition was later expanded to include industries located in various cities on the banks of River Ganga, including the Calcutta tanneries. The tanneries were found to be operating in extreme unhygienic conditions and discharging highly toxic effluents into the environment. The State of West Bengal and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board were found to be remiss in their statutory obligations to control pollution and stop environmental degradation.

The Court ordered the relocation of the Calcutta tanneries and the acquisition of land for a new tanneries' complex. The court order directs the Minister-in-charge of the Cottage and Small-Scale Industries Department to proceed with a project to relocate tanneries to a new complex within a specific time frame. The project must be entrusted to a technical authority for preparation within two months, and land acquisition proceedings must begin within one month. After the land is acquired, the State Government must develop it within three months. The court will monitor progress, and any violation of the order will result in contempt of court charges. The court has issued multiple orders and notices to ensure compliance with the project. The cost of land and the construction of an effluent treatment plant are also discussed.

The court order discusses the inclusion of the Tanneries' Project in West Bengal in the Ganga Action Plan and the allocation of funds for the project. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is directed to find a way to fund the project and file a fresh affidavit within three weeks. The court agrees to include the project in the Ganga Action Plan, Phase II, and directs the State of West Bengal to prepare and send the project for approval. The court also directs the relocation of tanneries to a new complex and levying an effluent charge on them. The State of West Bengal is required to file a report on the progress made in the matter. The court also allows tanneries to set up a common effluent treatment plant within their existing locations, subject to examination by experts.

The court has ordered Dr. P. Khanna to appoint a team of experts to examine the viability and feasibility of a project prepared by KROFTA. The team will determine if the project can be constructed without interfering with the normal life of residents and if it can control pollution and odour. The NEERI team will also consult with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and the West Bengal Government. The court has been monitoring the pollution caused by Calcutta tanneries and has ordered their relocation to a new complex. The court has rejected the tanneries' claim that the new complex is part of a wetland. The tanneries are operating in violation of the Water Act, and the court has taken steps to facilitate their relocation.

The court order requires Calcutta tanneries to obtain consent from the Board before discharging trade effluent into a stream or on land. The tanneries that have not obtained consent are liable to be prosecuted under the Water Act. The court orders the tanneries to relocate to a new leather complex set up by the West Bengal Government and deposit 25% of the land price before 28-2-1997. The tanneries failing to deposit the amount shall be closed on 15-4-1997. The court imposes a pollution fine of Rs. 10,000 each on all the tanneries in the four areas of Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia, and Pagla Danga. The compensation amount recovered from the polluting tanneries and the amount of fine recovered from the tanneries shall be deposited under a separate head called "Environment Protection Fund" and shall be utilized for restoring the damaged environment and ecology. The workmen employed in the Calcutta tanneries shall be entitled to certain rights and benefits.
