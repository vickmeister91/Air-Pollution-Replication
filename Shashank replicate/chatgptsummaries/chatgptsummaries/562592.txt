The court order pertains to two separate cases involving Air India and its pilots. In the first case, Sangeeta Barring filed a petition against Air India and its pilots for injuries sustained during an air accident in Mumbai in 1999. The court reviewed the findings of an inquiry conducted by the Director General of Civil Aviation and issued warnings to the pilots. However, the court did not find sufficient evidence to support the petitioner's claims for compensation and criminal charges against the pilots. The court also addressed false statements made in an affidavit filed by Air India and a subsequent contempt petition.

In the second case, a crew member of an Air India flight was injured due to the negligence of the pilots. The petitioner's lawyer argued that action should be taken against the pilots and Air India for their actions, and that the petitioner should be awarded exemplary damages. However, the court ruled that while the petitioner is entitled to compensation and other dues, exemplary damages are not warranted. The court directed Air India to reimburse the petitioner's medical bills and future bills, retain her in employment, and pay any further compensation she is entitled to. The court also noted that Air India has already provided significant financial support to the petitioner and that imposing further financial burden on the company would create problems for similar cases. The court dismissed the petitioner's request for criminal action against the pilots and Air India, and the case was disposed of.

In both cases, the court found that the petitioners were entitled to compensation and other dues, but did not find sufficient evidence to support claims for exemplary damages or criminal charges.
