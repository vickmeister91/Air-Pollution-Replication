In a recent court order, a writ petition filed by A G G Exim Private Ltd against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was dismissed. The court held that an alternative remedy was available under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore the writ petition was not maintainable.

The petitioner had filed a memo for withdrawal, indicating that they no longer wished to pursue the writ petition. However, the court still considered the matter and issued a ruling on the merits of the case.

The case concerned allegations of pollution by the petitioner's industrial unit. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had issued a show-cause notice to the petitioner, alleging that they had violated various environmental laws and regulations. The petitioner had challenged the notice on various grounds, including that it was issued without proper investigation and that the allegations were baseless.

The court noted that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 provides for an alternative remedy for such disputes. The Act establishes a specialized tribunal to hear and decide environmental disputes, with the power to issue orders and directions to prevent or remedy environmental damage. The court held that since the petitioner had not exhausted this alternative remedy, the writ petition was premature and not maintainable.

The court also noted that the petitioner had filed a memo for withdrawal, indicating that they no longer wished to pursue the writ petition. The court accepted the memo and dismissed the writ petition as withdrawn.

Overall, the court's ruling highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the courts. In environmental disputes, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 provides a specialized forum for resolving such disputes, and parties should make use of this forum before approaching the courts. Additionally, the court's acceptance of the memo for withdrawal indicates that parties have the right to withdraw their petitions at any time, even if the court has already considered the matter on the merits.
