The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Zala Vikramsinhji Kishorsinhji and others seeking to set aside a mining lease granted by the State Government to respondent No. 6 for mining bauxite stones. The petitioners contended that the mining operations would adversely affect gauchar lands, agricultural fields, and the boundaries of the riverbed area. The court granted a draft amendment but did not entertain the petition at this stage, stating that the issue of adverse effects on the environment and agricultural land was premature until the concerned authority considered the matter. The court also noted that the allotment of gauchar land for mining purposes without resumption from Gram Panchayat did not fall under PIL jurisdiction.

The writ petition filed by Zala Vikramsinhji Kishorsinhji and others sought to set aside a mining lease granted by the State Government to respondent No. 6 for mining bauxite stones. The petitioners argued that the mining operations would have adverse effects on gauchar lands, agricultural fields, and the boundaries of the riverbed area. The court granted a draft amendment but did not entertain the petition at this stage, stating that the issue of adverse effects on the environment and agricultural land was premature until the concerned authority considered the matter.

The court's decision to grant a draft amendment means that the petitioners can make changes to their petition and resubmit it at a later date. However, the court did not entertain the petition at this stage, indicating that the issue of adverse effects on the environment and agricultural land was premature until the concerned authority considered the matter.

The court's decision is significant because it highlights the importance of considering the potential environmental and agricultural impacts of mining operations. The court recognized that mining operations could have adverse effects on gauchar lands, agricultural fields, and the boundaries of the riverbed area. These impacts could have significant consequences for the local community, including the loss of livelihoods and damage to the environment.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following proper procedures when allocating land for mining purposes. The court noted that the allotment of gauchar land for mining purposes without resumption from Gram Panchayat did not fall under PIL jurisdiction. This means that the issue of land allocation for mining purposes should be addressed through the appropriate legal channels.

Overall, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the need to consider the potential environmental and agricultural impacts of mining operations. It also highlights the importance of following proper procedures when allocating land for mining purposes. By doing so, we can ensure that mining operations are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner that benefits both the local community and the environment.
