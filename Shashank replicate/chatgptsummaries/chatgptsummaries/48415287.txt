The court order in question pertains to a mining lease granted to Krishnadas Tikaram in 1966 to extract limestone in a forest area. The Forest (Conservation) Act 69 of 1980 came into force in 1980, which required prior approval of the Central Government for grant or renewal of leases in forest areas. In 1986, when the lease expired, the respondent approached the government for renewal, which was objected to by the Forest Department and subsequently cancelled.

The High Court directed the grant of renewal, but the Supreme Court held that the renewal could not be granted without prior approval of the Central Government. The cancellation of the renewal order was deemed proper, and the registration of the lease deed under contempt proceedings was declared illegal and invalid.

The case highlights the importance of environmental conservation and the need for strict adherence to laws and regulations in this regard. The Forest (Conservation) Act 69 of 1980 was enacted to protect forests and wildlife in the country, and it is imperative that all stakeholders comply with its provisions.
