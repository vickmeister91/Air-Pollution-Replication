The case of Bharat Petroleum Corporation v. State of Maharashtra concerned the withdrawal of a "No Objection Certificate" (NOC) granted to the petitioner for the installation of a retail outlet. The petitioner had applied for the NOC in 2011 and it was granted in 2012. However, in 2013, the NOC was withdrawn without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The petitioner challenged the withdrawal of the NOC on the grounds that it was in violation of Rule 150 of the Petroleum Rules, 2002 and principles of equity and natural justice. Rule 150 provides that a NOC can only be withdrawn after giving the holder an opportunity to be heard. The petitioner argued that this opportunity was not given to them before the NOC was withdrawn.

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the withdrawal of the NOC was indeed in violation of Rule 150. The court also noted that the principles of equity and natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. In this case, the petitioner was not given this opportunity before the NOC was withdrawn.

The court therefore quashed the order withdrawing the NOC. However, the court also noted that the respondents (the State of Maharashtra and the concerned authorities) were entitled to take appropriate action against the petitioner in accordance with the law. This means that while the NOC cannot be withdrawn without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard, the respondents can still take action against the petitioner if they have grounds to do so.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of following due process and principles of equity and natural justice when taking administrative actions. The court's decision ensures that the petitioner's rights are protected and that they are given a fair opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them.
