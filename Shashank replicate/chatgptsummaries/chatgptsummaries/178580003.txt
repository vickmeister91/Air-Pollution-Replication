The Supreme Court of India recently allowed the appeal of Nitya Dharmananda, also known as K. Lenin, and set aside the view of the High Court in the case of Sri Gopal Sheelum Reddy, also known as Nithya Bhaktananda. The respondent was charged with offences under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court allowed the respondent's application to summon the entire material available with the investigator, which was not made part of the chargesheet, under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The Supreme Court held that while ordinarily the Court has to proceed on the basis of material produced with the chargesheet for dealing with the issue of charge, if the court is satisfied that there is material of sterling quality which has been withheld by the investigator/prosecutor, the court is not debarred from summoning or relying upon the same even if such document is not a part of the chargesheet. The trial court may now proceed to deal with the issue of framing of charge in the light of the observations made and also to proceed with the matter expeditiously in accordance with law.
