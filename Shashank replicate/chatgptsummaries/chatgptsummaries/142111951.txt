A writ petition was filed by the petitioner to quash a summon issued by the police under Sections 160 and 91 of the CrPC. The petitioner also sought a direction to the police not to harass him. The police had registered a case against someone else and had sent a summon to the petitioner during the course of their investigation. The petitioner argued that he should be exempted from appearing before the police pursuant to the summon.

The court held that the petitioner cannot be exempted from appearing before the police pursuant to the summon. However, the impugned summon did not even disclose the date on which the petitioner should appear. Therefore, the petitioner can ignore the summon. The court directed the police to issue a fresh summon in advance giving the date and time for the petitioner's appearance. The petitioner shall not be harassed during the enquiry.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Sections 160 and 91 of the CrPC. Section 160 of the CrPC empowers the police to require the attendance of any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of a case. Section 91 of the CrPC empowers the police to issue a summons to any person to produce any document or thing that may be necessary for the purpose of any investigation.

However, the impugned summon did not even disclose the date on which the petitioner should appear. Therefore, the petitioner can ignore the summon. The court directed the police to issue a fresh summon in advance giving the date and time for the petitioner's appearance.
