The Supreme Court of India recently made a significant ruling in the case of Shabi Haider Jafri against the State of Uttar Pradesh. The court allowed an appeal by Jafri and set aside an order dated 2 April 2018. As a result of this ruling, the National Green Tribunal will now hear and decide the application filed for the grant of an Environmental Clearance in respect of OA No 125/2013. This application challenges the Environment Clearance granted on 18 November 2011 by the SEIAA to the UP State Industrial Development Corporation Limited for the construction of a leather park complex.

The case of Shabi Haider Jafri against the State of Uttar Pradesh has been ongoing for several years. Jafri filed an application challenging the Environment Clearance granted to the UP State Industrial Development Corporation Limited for the construction of a leather park complex. The application was filed under OA No 125/2013 and was heard by the National Green Tribunal.

The National Green Tribunal is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and issues. It was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving environmental issues and disputes.

In this case, Jafri argued that the Environment Clearance granted to the UP State Industrial Development Corporation Limited was illegal and in violation of various environmental laws and regulations. Jafri claimed that the construction of the leather park complex would have a significant impact on the environment and would cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem.

The SEIAA, on the other hand, argued that the Environment Clearance was granted after due consideration of all relevant factors and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The SEIAA claimed that the construction of the leather park complex would not have a significant impact on the environment and that all necessary precautions had been taken to ensure that the project was environmentally sustainable.

The National Green Tribunal heard the arguments of both parties and eventually ruled in favor of the SEIAA. The tribunal held that the Environment Clearance granted to the UP State Industrial Development Corporation Limited was legal and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The tribunal also held that the construction of the leather park complex would not have a significant impact on the environment and that all necessary precautions had been taken to ensure that the project was environmentally sustainable.

Jafri was not satisfied with the ruling of the National Green Tribunal and decided to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of India. Jafri argued that the National Green Tribunal had erred in its interpretation of the law and had failed to consider all relevant factors in reaching its decision.

The Supreme Court of India heard the appeal and after considering all the arguments put forward by both parties, allowed the appeal by Jafri and set aside the order of the National Green Tribunal. The court held that the National Green Tribunal had not properly considered all the relevant factors in reaching its decision and had therefore erred in law.

As a result of this ruling, the National Green Tribunal will now hear and decide the application filed by Jafri for the grant of an Environmental Clearance in respect of OA No 125/2013. This is a significant development in the case and could have far-reaching implications for the construction of the leather park complex.

In conclusion, the ruling of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Shabi Haider Jafri against the State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant development in the ongoing dispute over the construction of a leather park complex. The court's decision to allow the appeal by Jafri and set aside the order of the National Green Tribunal is likely to have far-reaching implications for the construction industry in India. It remains to be seen how the National Green Tribunal will now decide the application filed by Jafri, but this ruling is a clear indication that the courts are taking environmental issues seriously and are willing to intervene to protect the environment.
