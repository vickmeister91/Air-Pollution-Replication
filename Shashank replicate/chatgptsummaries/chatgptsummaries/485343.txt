The court order pertains to a case where the validity of a notification issued under Section 18 of the Wild Life Protection Act is being questioned. The notification prohibits individuals from carrying out pisciculture in lands owned or occupied by them until a final notification under Section 26-A of the Act is issued. The petitioners argue that until the final notification is issued, the authorities cannot interfere with their fishing operations. The government, on the other hand, argues that the area is covered under the Coastal Regulatory Zone and aquaculture is prohibited. The court is considering whether the notification under Section 18 is valid and whether the authorities can restrain the petitioners from continuing their fishing operations until the final notification is issued.

The court notes that final notification is required to be issued under Section 26-A of the Act before restrictions can be made applicable, and until then, the respondents cannot refuse to carry on with fishing operations. The court directs the government to complete the process of issuing final notification within six months and permits pattedars and leaseholders to continue fishing operations until then. However, they are not allowed to construct any fish tanks or make any preparations in that regard. The court also permits those holding valid leases or D Form Patta to exploit the land for the purpose for which the lease was made or patta was granted.

The court has disposed of the writ petitions and no costs are to be paid.
