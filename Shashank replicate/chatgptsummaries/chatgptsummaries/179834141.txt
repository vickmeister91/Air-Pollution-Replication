The court order in question pertains to two bail applications filed by individuals accused of hunting and eating a Schedule III animal, Sambar, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has allowed the bail applications and directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court for their appearance as and when directed.

The court has taken into consideration the nature and gravity of the offence, the role of the accused in the offence, and their pretrial detention. The accused were charged with hunting and eating a Sambar, which is a protected animal under the Wild Life Protection Act. The act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal listed under Schedule I to IV of the act. The Sambar is listed under Schedule III of the act, which means that it is not as endangered as animals listed under Schedule I and II, but it is still protected under the act.

The court has considered the nature and gravity of the offence while granting bail to the accused. The act of hunting and eating a protected animal is a serious offence, and the court has taken this into account while granting bail. The court has also considered the role of the accused in the offence. It is not clear from the court order what the role of the accused was in the offence, but it is likely that they were the ones who hunted and ate the Sambar. The court has taken this into account while granting bail.

The court has also considered the pretrial detention of the accused while granting bail. Pretrial detention is the detention of an accused person before their trial. The court has taken into account the fact that the accused have been in pretrial detention for some time and has granted them bail. The court has directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court for their appearance as and when directed. This means that the accused will have to provide a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each and one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court. This is a standard condition for granting bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to two individuals accused of hunting and eating a Schedule III animal, Sambar, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has taken into consideration the nature and gravity of the offence, the role of the accused in the offence, and their pretrial detention while granting bail. The court has directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like sum to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court for their appearance as and when directed. This is a standard condition for granting bail.
