The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to a dispute over the land use of a 14.3-hectare plot of land in Delhi that was auctioned by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for a residential project. The highest bidder, who paid Rs 450.01 crores, was unable to proceed with the project due to a dispute over the land use, which was claimed by the Environment Department to be part of the ridge area and therefore not suitable for construction. The petitioner sought a refund of the amount paid to the DDA along with interest, and the cancellation of the auction and allotment letter.

In one of the court orders, the DDA invited private parties to develop a composite project area of 14.3 hectares of prime land at Tehkhand in South Delhi for building 750 premium residential flats to be sold by private real estate development on a free sale basis. The petitioner made a bid of Rs 450.10 crores, which was the highest, and paid the entire bid amount of Rs 450.01 crores to DDA by 11.09.2006. The DDA issued a letter to the petitioner that the work was to be completed within a period of three years, that is, up to 04.09.2010, and that the possession had been handed over on 04.12.2006 but the work had not been started. The court directed the parties to await a decision from the Ministry of Environment and Forests and also considered a proposal for the return of the principal amount paid by the petitioner.

Another court order discusses a modification made by the Central Government to the Master Plan for Delhi, changing the land use of an area from recreational to residential. The controversy arises from the fact that the area in question is part of the Ridge, which is to be preserved in its pristine glory according to the Master Plan. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) requested the petitioner to submit an application for consent to establish and a copy of the environmental clearance issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF). The DPCC also requested a ridge demarcation report. The DDA clarified that the land use had already been changed from recreational to residential and that the notifications were issued after following the due process of law. The Ministry of Environment and Forests accorded environmental clearance to the project. The petitioner requested the DPCC to issue the consent to establish under the Air and Water Acts for the project at the earliest so that construction activity could be commenced without any further delay.

In another court order, the DDA and the Department of Forests filed counter-affidavits, with the former claiming that the land use had been changed from recreational to residential and the latter claiming that the land was part of the Delhi ridge and required prior approval from the Supreme Court for construction. The court was asked to decide who had the authority to determine land use in Delhi, and it found that the DDA was responsible for preparing and approving the master plan and zonal development plans, and that modifications to these plans had to be made in accordance with a prescribed procedure. The court did not make a final decision on the dispute, but noted that the matter required further investigation.

In yet another court order, the court states that once a master plan or zonal plan is in place, no one can use land or buildings in that zone in a way that does not conform to the plan. The DDA has the authority to prepare these plans and any modifications to them must go through a formal process. The DDA has stated that the land in question is earmarked for residential use and is outside the ridge area. The Department of Forests and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have raised objections, but their role is limited to examining the grant or non-grant of consent to establish within the Water and Air Acts. The court feels that the petitioner is entitled to a direction to the DPCC to examine their application for consent to establish from the standpoint of the Water and Air Acts alone within two months. If consent is not given, the petitioner is entitled to a return of the entire sum paid to the DDA with interest.

In conclusion, the court orders all revolve around a dispute over the land use of a 14.3-hectare plot of land in Delhi that was auctioned by the DDA for a residential project. The highest bidder was unable to proceed with the project due to a dispute over the land use, which was claimed by the Environment Department to be part of the ridge area and therefore not suitable for construction. The court directed the parties to await a decision from the Ministry of Environment and Forests and also considered a proposal for the return of the principal amount paid by the petitioner. The court found that the DDA was responsible for preparing and approving the master plan and zonal development plans, and that modifications to these plans had to be made in accordance with a prescribed procedure. The court also noted that the matter required further investigation.
