The Jharkhand High Court has ordered the Civil Surgeons of respective districts to file a composite report on the implementation of Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and other provisions of the Environment Protection Act by April 5, 2019. The report should be filed through an affidavit by the Secretary, Health Department, Government of Jharkhand. The matter will be listed again on April 5, 2019.

The court's order comes in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a social activist, who alleged that the hospitals in the state were not following the rules for the management and handling of biomedical waste. The petitioner claimed that the hospitals were disposing of the waste in an unscientific manner, which was causing pollution and posing a threat to public health.

The court observed that the issue of biomedical waste management was of utmost importance, as it had a direct impact on public health and the environment. The court noted that the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, had been enacted to regulate the management and handling of biomedical waste and to ensure that it was disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.

The court directed the Civil Surgeons of respective districts to ensure that the hospitals in their jurisdiction were following the rules for the management and handling of biomedical waste. The court also directed the Secretary, Health Department, Government of Jharkhand, to ensure that the hospitals were provided with the necessary infrastructure and equipment for the proper management and handling of biomedical waste.

The court further directed the State Pollution Control Board to monitor the implementation of the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, and to take appropriate action against the hospitals that were found to be violating the rules.

The court's order is a welcome step towards ensuring that the hospitals in Jharkhand follow the rules for the management and handling of biomedical waste. The proper management and handling of biomedical waste is essential to protect public health and the environment. The court's order will help to ensure that the hospitals in Jharkhand are held accountable for their actions and that they take the necessary steps to manage and handle biomedical waste in an environmentally sound manner.
