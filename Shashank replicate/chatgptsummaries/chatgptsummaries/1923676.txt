In the case at hand, a family was travelling by train when the wife and one of their children fell out of the train and were killed. The husband filed a suit against the railway company claiming compensation for their loss, alleging negligence on the part of the railway employees. The court found that the incident was due to the negligence of the deceased and directed the railway company to make an ex gratia payment of Rs. 10,000. The husband appealed the decision, arguing that the railway company was liable to pay compensation.

The appeal was heard by the court, which considered the duty of care owed by the railway company to its passengers. The court found that there was evidence of negligence on the part of the railway employees, and that the deceased passenger was not at fault for the accident. As a result, the court allowed the appeal and ordered the railway company to pay compensation to the family.

The court awarded compensation to the plaintiffs for the pecuniary loss sustained due to the deceased's earnings and the loss of the child. The court allowed an amount of Rs. 35,000 towards compensation and ordered the defendant to pay interest on the amount decreed at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of plaint till realization. The defendant was also liable to pay the costs incurred by the plaintiffs in both courts.

The court's decision was based on the principle of duty of care owed by the railway company to its passengers. The court found that the railway employees were negligent in their duties, which resulted in the death of the wife and child. The court also found that the deceased passenger was not at fault for the accident, and therefore the railway company was liable to pay compensation to the family.
