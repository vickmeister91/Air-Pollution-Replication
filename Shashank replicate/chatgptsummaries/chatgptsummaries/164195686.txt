The first court order pertains to an application filed by the plaintiffs seeking an ad interim injunction against the defendants for restoration of electricity supply to their premises during the pendency of the suit. The plaintiffs allege that they are running a paper cutting machine from their premises and are consumers of electricity from the defendant. They contend that the sanctioned load of 2KV has been given in both the connections and they have been regularly paying the electricity bills. The defendants have opposed the application, stating that the plaintiffs are running the industry without obtaining any municipal license and that the property is situated in a non-conforming area. The court has heard oral arguments from both parties and has yet to make a final decision.

In the second court order, the plaintiffs were running a business in a non-conforming area in violation of the DMC Act. The defendant disconnected the electricity supply to the plaintiffs' premises, and the plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction against this action. However, the court found that the plaintiffs had not shown the existence of a prima facie case in their favor, as they did not have a valid license for running the business from the properties in question. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had suppressed the material fact of allotment of an alternative site to the plaintiff no. 1 in lieu of the property no. 3404. As a result, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' application under order 39 rules 1 and 2 CPC.
