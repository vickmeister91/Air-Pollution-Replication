The Rajasthan High Court recently passed an order pertaining to a group of petitioners who claimed to be the owners of vehicles seized by forest or police officers on suspicion of forest offences under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners had applied for interim release of their vehicles under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but their applications were rejected on the grounds that no court had jurisdiction to order for such interim release due to a bar under Section 52C of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953.

The court was asked to determine whether vehicles seized under the Act can be released during the pendency of the trial by the criminal court where the trial is pending or whether such a power can only be exercised by the competent authority named in the Act. The court analyzed various sections of the Act and concluded that the authorized Forest Officer can order for confiscation of the vehicle only after sending an intimation to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence on account of which the seizure has been made.

The court order states that if a forest offence has been committed using a vehicle, an authorized Forest Officer may confiscate the vehicle by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded. However, the officer cannot order for such confiscation unless he sends an intimation in a prescribed form about initiation of proceedings for confiscation of property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. Once the vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi.

The order also cites previous Supreme Court rulings on similar provisions in other Acts and holds that a vehicle seized under the provisions of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 cannot be released during the pendency of trial on supurdgi to the registered owner by the Magistrate, where the trial is pending, in view of specific bar to jurisdiction of Court under section 52C of the Act.

In essence, the court order clarifies that the authorized Forest Officer can order for confiscation of a vehicle used in a forest offence only after sending an intimation to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. Once the vehicle is seized and subjected to confiscation proceedings upon prior intimation to the Magistrate, no court including the Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to order for release of such vehicle on supurdgi. This means that the registered owner of the vehicle cannot seek interim release of the vehicle during the pendency of the trial by the criminal court where the trial is pending.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the powers of the authorized Forest Officer and the jurisdiction of the Magistrate in cases of seizure of vehicles under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. It also highlights the importance of following due process and sending intimation to the Magistrate before ordering for confiscation of a vehicle. The order is likely to have an impact on future cases involving seizure of vehicles under the Act and will provide clarity to both the authorities and the owners of the vehicles.
