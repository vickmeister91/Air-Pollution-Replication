In a recent court order, Bapu Bansi Sonawane was granted ad-interim anticipatory bail in connection with a crime registered against him. The court ordered that if he is arrested, he will be released on executing a PR bond of Rs. 15,000 with surety in the same amount. Additionally, he must appear before the investigating officer when required and not tamper with prosecution evidence. The case was adjourned until January 8, 2020.

The granting of anticipatory bail is a legal provision that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This provision is available to individuals who fear that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offense. In this case, Bapu Bansi Sonawane had approached the court seeking anticipatory bail in connection with a crime registered against him.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, granted ad-interim anticipatory bail to Bapu Bansi Sonawane. This means that he will be protected from arrest until the next hearing of the case. However, he must comply with certain conditions set by the court.

One of the conditions set by the court is that Bapu Bansi Sonawane must execute a PR bond of Rs. 15,000 with surety in the same amount. A PR bond is a personal recognizance bond, which means that the person signing the bond is guaranteeing that the accused will appear in court when required. If the accused fails to appear in court, the person who signed the bond will be liable to pay the amount specified in the bond.

Another condition set by the court is that Bapu Bansi Sonawane must appear before the investigating officer when required. This means that he must cooperate with the investigation and provide any information or documents that may be required by the investigating officer.

The court also ordered that Bapu Bansi Sonawane must not tamper with prosecution evidence. This means that he must not destroy or alter any evidence that may be used against him in court. If he is found to have tampered with prosecution evidence, it may be used against him in court and may also result in the cancellation of his bail.

Finally, the court adjourned the case until January 8, 2020. This means that the next hearing of the case will take place on this date. Until then, Bapu Bansi Sonawane will be protected from arrest as long as he complies with the conditions set by the court.

In conclusion, the court has granted ad-interim anticipatory bail to Bapu Bansi Sonawane in connection with a crime registered against him. He will be protected from arrest until the next hearing of the case, as long as he complies with the conditions set by the court. The granting of anticipatory bail is an important legal provision that allows individuals to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. It is designed to protect the rights of individuals and ensure that they are not subjected to unnecessary harassment or detention.
