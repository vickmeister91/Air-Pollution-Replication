The Andhra Pradesh Dairy Development Co-operative Federation Ltd. Workers' Union has challenged the legality of a circular issued by the Guntur District Milk Producers' Co-operative Union Limited (Sangam Dairy) regarding the seniority list of workers employed on Nominal Muster Rolls. The petitioner asserts that the respondent is "the State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and is seeking a writ of mandamus declaring that the impugned circular is illegal, arbitrary and without jurisdiction. The court is considering whether the writ petitions are maintainable against the respondent-Sangam Dairy, a society registered under the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act.

The court order discusses the question of whether a co-operative society can be considered an "authority" under Article 12 of the Constitution and therefore subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226. The court cites various precedents and ultimately concludes that whether a co-operative society is subject to writ jurisdiction depends on the nature of its power/function/duty. If it is under a statutory obligation of a public nature, a writ in the nature of mandamus can be issued against it. The court also discusses the scope of Article 12 and the definition of "authority" and cites various tests to determine whether an entity can be considered an authority.

The court order discusses the criteria for determining whether a corporation or legal person is an instrumentality or agency of the government, and therefore falls under the definition of "State" in Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. Factors such as substantial financial aid, control by the government, performance of public functions, and entrustment of governmental activities are considered. The case specifically examines whether the Sangam Dairy, a co-operative society registered under the A.P. Co-operative Societies Act, is an authority under Article 12. The court finds that the society carries out a public utility service and its objective is not to make a profit, but to promote socio-economic development of milk producers. Almost the entire share capital was invested by the State Government.

The court order discusses the status of a cooperative society and whether it falls under the definition of "authority" under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. The court concludes that the society in question does fall under this definition due to the deep and pervasive control exercised by the government and the overwhelming financial support provided by the state. As an authority under Article 12, the actions of the society can be judicially reviewed under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also clarifies that breach of bye-laws of a cooperative society falling within the ambit of Article 12 are not outside the purview of judicial review.

The court order states that non-observance of non-statutory rules or practices can result in arbitrariness, absence of fair-play, or discrimination, particularly if the authority making such rules falls under the definition of "State" under Article 12. Matters concerning bye-laws of bodies falling under Article 12 are not outside the purview of judicial review. The respondent society is under a statutory obligation to implement the settlement concluded between the management of the society and the two recognized registered workers unions. The settlement is binding on all parties and must be adhered to. The Circular issued by the respondent is set aside, and the seniority list prepared on the basis of that Circular shall not be implemented. The court also states that a statutory duty enjoined on a co-operative society can be enforced by a writ of mandamus, even if the society is not an authority under Article 12.

In summary, the court order deals with the question of whether a co-operative society can be considered an "authority" under Article 12 of the Constitution and therefore subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226. The court concludes that whether a co-operative society is subject to writ jurisdiction depends on the nature of its power/function/duty. If it is under a statutory obligation of a public nature, a writ in the nature of mandamus can be issued against it. The court also discusses the criteria for determining whether a corporation or legal person is an instrumentality or agency of the government, and therefore falls under the definition of "State" in Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. The court finds that the Sangam Dairy, a co-operative society registered under the A.P. Co-operative Societies Act, is an authority under Article 12 due to the deep and pervasive control exercised by the government and the overwhelming financial support provided by the state. The court also clarifies that breach of bye-laws of a cooperative society falling within the ambit of Article 12 are not outside the purview of judicial review. The court orders the respondent society to implement the settlement concluded between the management of the society and the two recognized registered workers unions and sets aside the Circular issued by the respondent.
