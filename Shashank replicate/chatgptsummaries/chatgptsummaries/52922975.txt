The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by M/s. Green India Enterprises seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the Commissioner of Customs to release goods covered under Bills of Entry No.8621647. The Department did not accept the classification of the goods as "Bird Scare Device" and confiscated them under the Arms Act and Environment Protection Act. 

The Commissioner of Customs (Appeals-II) set aside the order of absolute confiscation and directed the Department to get the goods examined by the Forensic Department. The petitioner agreed to furnish the required information to the Department, and the second respondent was directed to issue notice to the petitioner to appear in person and give appropriate instructions. 

Based on the report submitted by the Forensic Science Department, the second respondent shall pass appropriate orders within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of the report. 

The case at hand involves the classification of goods and the appropriate legal framework under which they should be confiscated. The petitioner, M/s. Green India Enterprises, had imported goods that they classified as "Bird Scare Device". However, the Department did not accept this classification and instead confiscated the goods under the Arms Act and Environment Protection Act. 

The Commissioner of Customs (Appeals-II) reviewed the case and set aside the order of absolute confiscation. Instead, the Department was directed to get the goods examined by the Forensic Department. The petitioner agreed to furnish the required information to the Department, and the second respondent was directed to issue notice to the petitioner to appear in person and give appropriate instructions. 

This decision was based on the fact that the appropriate legal framework under which the goods should be confiscated was unclear. The Arms Act and Environment Protection Act were not necessarily the most appropriate legal frameworks for the goods in question. 

The Forensic Science Department was tasked with examining the goods and providing a report on their nature and classification. Based on this report, the second respondent would pass appropriate orders within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of the report. 

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of proper classification of goods and the appropriate legal framework under which they should be confiscated. It also emphasizes the need for clear guidelines and procedures for such cases to ensure that they are handled in a fair and just manner.
