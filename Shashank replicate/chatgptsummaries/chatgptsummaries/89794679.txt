The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by A.V. Shanmugasundaram, who is the A-1 accused in the 'Indian Bank Scam Case'. The petitioner had filed a petition to send for a file relating to a departmental enquiry initiated against him by the Central Vigilance Commission. However, the Trial Court had rejected the petition on the grounds that the petitioner had not demonstrated its relevancy.

The court order states that departmental proceedings and criminal proceedings are different, and the Trial Court had found no relevancy in the petition. The order does not call for any interference, but the petitioner can produce his documents under Section 314 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage of the case.

To understand the context of this court order, it is important to know about the 'Indian Bank Scam Case'. The case pertains to a scam that took place in the Indian Bank in the early 1990s. The scam involved the issuance of fake bank guarantees to various companies, which resulted in a loss of over Rs. 130 crore to the bank.

A.V. Shanmugasundaram was one of the accused in the case. He was a senior officer in the bank and was allegedly involved in the scam. The case has been going on for over two decades, and several accused have been convicted and sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment.

In this context, the petition filed by Shanmugasundaram to send for a file relating to a departmental enquiry initiated against him by the Central Vigilance Commission assumes significance. The petitioner had argued that the file was relevant to his defence in the criminal case, as it contained information that could help him prove his innocence.

However, the Trial Court had rejected the petition on the grounds that the petitioner had not demonstrated its relevancy. The court order states that departmental proceedings and criminal proceedings are different, and the Trial Court had found no relevancy in the petition.

The order does not call for any interference, but the petitioner can produce his documents under Section 314 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage of the case. Section 314 of the Criminal Procedure Code allows a person accused of an offence to produce any document or thing in his possession or power, which is relevant to the case.

In other words, the court has not completely closed the door on the petitioner's request for the file. The petitioner can still produce the file at the appropriate stage of the case, if he can demonstrate its relevancy to the criminal proceedings.

Overall, the court order in question is significant in the context of the 'Indian Bank Scam Case'. It highlights the importance of demonstrating the relevancy of documents in criminal proceedings and underscores the difference between departmental proceedings and criminal proceedings. It also provides a ray of hope for the petitioner, as he can still produce the file at the appropriate stage of the case.
