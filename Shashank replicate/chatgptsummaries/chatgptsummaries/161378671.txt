The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been receiving applications from various organizations and individuals seeking protection and conservation of the Western Ghats, a mountain range in India that is home to many endemic species. The NGT has been tasked with determining the scope of its jurisdiction and whether it has the power to enforce recommendations made by expert committees.

One of the applications received by the NGT was from the Goa Foundation and Peaceful Society, who requested interim relief to prevent the issuance of any consent or environmental clearance in the Western Ghat areas. The applicants claimed to be at the forefront of environmental campaigns in Goa and demanded additional protection for the ecology of Western Ghats. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel submitted a report to the government on August 31, 2011, which remains pending for consideration with the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The Bombay High Court ordered the State Government to send its comments/suggestions to the Ministry of Environment and Forests as soon as possible to enable the Ministry to make a decision regarding the acceptance of the report of Dr. Madhav Gadgil Committee. The court also grants further time for the State Government to file an affidavit and directs the Chief Secretaries of the Respondent-States to cooperate with the Committee constituted by Respondent No.1 so that the report could be finalized at the earliest. The Western Ghats are described as a treasure trove of biological diversity in India, with nearly 4000 species of flowering plants and 220 species of amphibians, among other unique flora and fauna.

The NGT Act provides for the establishment of the Tribunal to handle cases related to environmental protection and conservation, and the court must interpret the relevant provisions to determine the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The court order expands the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and access to people by using the words "for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto". The Preamble of the NGT Act is relevant in interpreting the Act and helps in understanding the legislative intention. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment arises. The expression "civil cases" is of wide magnitude and includes cases where a substantial question or prayer relating to environment is raised before the Tribunal.

The court also explains the definition of "environment" and "substantial question relating to environment" under the NGT Act. Substantial questions relating to environment must be debatable, not previously settled and must have a material bearing on the case and its issues relating to environment. The court emphasizes that disputes must relate to the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. The court further states that Section 16 of the NGT Act gives a right to any person to prefer an appeal and that the person aggrieved can be a person who has no direct or personal interest in invoking the provisions of the Act but can show that it affects the environment.

The court order examines the meaning of "cause of action" in the context of Rule 14 of the National Green Tribunal (Practices and Procedure) Rules, 2011. The court cites previous Supreme Court cases to define "cause of action" as a bundle of facts necessary to support a plaintiff's claim for relief. The court also discusses the meaning of "dispute" in the context of the NGT Act, stating that it includes any controversy related to the environment, regardless of whether it is contested by another party. The court emphasizes that the NGT is not person-centric, but rather socio-centric, as any person can raise a question related to the environment.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the NGT in relation to civil cases and disputes arising from environmental protection and conservation. The court states that the NGT has a wide jurisdiction and can entertain all civil cases raising questions of environment, including those involving anticipated or likely damage to the environment. The court also notes that the NGT can issue appropriate directions to the government to discharge its statutory obligations under the Environment Act. The court emphasizes that the NGT's jurisdiction is limited by the provisions of the NGT Act and that the tribunal cannot direct the government to accept or reject any particular course of action. The court concludes that the question of how to settle and decide disputes arising from environmental protection and conservation is a matter to be considered on the merits of the case and at the appropriate stage.

The court order states that if the Tribunal is satisfied with the merits of the case, it can issue appropriate directions for the State to fulfill its statutory obligations under the Environment Act. The petitioner has a legal right to approach the Tribunal and seek relief within the framework of the NGT Act, even if they do not show any personal injury or actual damage to the environment. The court holds that the present application is maintainable before the Tribunal and directs that the main application be listed for hearing on merits.

In summary, the court orders discussed the jurisdiction of the NGT in cases related to environmental consequences and the protection and conservation of the Western Ghats. The court emphasized that disputes must relate to the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act and that the NGT has a wide jurisdiction to entertain all civil cases raising questions of environment. The court also clarified the definition of "environment" and "substantial question relating to environment" under the NGT Act and explained the meaning of "cause of action" and "dispute" in the context of the NGT Act. The court held that the petitioner has a legal right to approach the
