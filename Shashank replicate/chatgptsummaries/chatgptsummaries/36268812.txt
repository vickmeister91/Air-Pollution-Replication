The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the issue of noise pollution and its regulation during religious festivals and cultural gatherings. The first court order was filed by a social worker, Rajendra Kumar Verma, who sought direction from state authorities to prevent environmental noise pollution caused during festive seasons, religious and social ceremonies, and other atrocities committed on society in the name of religious festivals. The petitioner argued that citizens have a right to a decent environment and to live peacefully, which includes the right to sound sleep at night, leisure, and free locomotion during the day time. The court referred to various laws and rules, including the Constitution of India, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1982, the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, the Indian Penal Code, and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, to support the petitioner's argument that noise pollution should not be countenanced. The court also highlighted the serious health hazards and nuisance caused by unregulated use of sound amplifiers during festivals and cultural gatherings.

The second court order pertained to a petition seeking regulation of noise pollution caused by religious festivals and pandals in Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner requested a writ of mandamus to restrict the installation of pandals in congested areas, limit the decibel level of sound systems, prevent theft of electricity, and ensure that anti-social elements are not involved in running pandals. The court granted interim relief and directed the authorities to ensure that pandals do not obstruct traffic and noise levels do not exceed prescribed limits. The Pollution Control Board and Electricity Board filed returns stating their roles in regulating noise pollution and electricity supply to pandals. The court referred to a previous case on noise pollution and issued directions to regulate the use of firecrackers.

The third court order outlined conditions for manufacturers of firecrackers to export their products, including conforming to noise standards in the destination country and labeling the products as not for sale in India. The order also set limits on noise levels for loudspeakers and vehicular noise, and called for public awareness campaigns on the hazards of noise pollution. The order remained in force until modified by the court or superseded by legislation. The court also clarified the validity of rules on noise pollution and the power of state governments to grant exemptions.

The fourth court order discussed the regulation of noise pollution and the obligation of authorities to ensure compliance with restrictions on noise levels. The court also clarified the scope of exemptions granted by the state government and emphasized the need for due care and caution in exercising this power. The court directed concerned authorities to ensure strict compliance with restrictions and to take all precautionary measures to prohibit violations of any provisions on the subject. The court also discussed the provisions of the Adhiniyam of 1985 and the Central Rules of 2000 regarding noise pollution and specified the ambient air quality standards in respect of noise for different areas/zones.

The fifth court order discussed the Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000, which impose restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and public address systems to control noise pollution. Rule 5 specifies the time limits and sound levels for such devices, with a limited exemption for cultural or religious festivals. The court found that Section 13 of the Adhiniyam of 1985, which allows for a longer exemption period, is in conflict with the Central Rules and therefore ultra vires. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to these restrictions to protect basic human and fundamental rights, and warned of potential legal consequences for violators. The court ultimately declared Section 13 of the Adhiniyam as ultra vires.

The sixth court order discussed the regulations and restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and public spaces during religious festivals. It emphasized the need for adherence to noise level restrictions and the proper granting of permissions for the use of public spaces. The order also addressed the issue of theft of electricity and extortion in the name of donations for pandals and suggested measures to address these issues. The court also mentioned previous judgments on the use of sound systems for religious activities and the interference with the rights of registered societies.

The seventh court order referred to a previous judgment by the National Green Tribunal regarding the control of noise pollution. The court directed various departments to take actions such as establishing a call center for complaints related to noise pollution, drawing up action plans for controlling noise pollution in different areas, and conducting awareness programs. The court appreciated the petitioner's initiative in bringing the issue of noise pollution to the forefront and disposed of the petition with the above observations.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of regulating noise pollution during religious festivals and cultural gatherings to protect the basic human and fundamental rights of citizens. The courts have referred to various laws and rules, including the Constitution of India, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1982, the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, the Indian Penal Code, and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, to support the need for regulation. The courts have also emphasized the serious health hazards and nuisance caused by unregulated use of sound amplifiers during festivals and cultural gatherings. The court orders have set limits on noise levels for loudspeakers and vehicular noise, and called for public awareness campaigns on the hazards of noise pollution. The courts have also clarified the validity of rules on noise pollution and the power of state governments to grant exemptions
