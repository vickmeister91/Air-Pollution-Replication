The issue of waste management and disposal has become a major concern in many cities across India. In Chennai, several court orders have been issued regarding the construction and operation of compost yards for waste processing. These court orders have been issued in response to writ petitions filed by various associations and individuals seeking to prevent the construction of compost yards in their localities.

One such writ petition was filed by the Sairam Avenue First Cross Street Owners and Residents Welfare Association under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The association sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the respondents from constructing and operating a compost yard for dumping and waste processing in the locality at Poothapedu School street in Ward No.151, Sector -34, Zone -11, Valasarawalkam, Chennai. The petitioner association argued that the construction of the compost yard would cause foul smell and pollution, leading to highly inconvenient and unhygienic conditions for the residents, children, and staff in the school and primary health center. The case is pending before the National Green Tribunal Chennai.

Another writ petition was filed regarding the construction of a compost yard in an area earmarked for a park. The petitioner argued that the area cannot be used for any other purpose, while the Corporation argued that there is a necessity to build a compost yard due to the increase in waste generated. The court had two options: to dismiss the writ petition since the petitioner had already approached the National Green Tribunal, or to consider the merits of the case and dispose of the writ petition. The court noted that municipalities and local bodies have to balance the competing interests of having parks and dumping yards, and cannot be found fault with for converting a portion of parks into dumping yards. The court also noted that similar issues have been raised before and that a compost yard in a small portion of the park cannot be said to be an encroachment.

In another court order, it was stated that the compost yard cannot be removed and must be used for removing garbage and waste. The petitioners can only request that the area remains litter-free and that regular fogging operations are carried out. The compost yard must be cleaned twice a day and residents must cooperate in segregating waste. The court also noted that the interest and welfare of society is paramount and that the setting up of a Micro Compost Plant in a playground is necessary for proper waste management. The court suggested that the waste generated by residents must be segregated into bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable wastes.

Another court order discussed the setting up of a Micro Compost Yard for waste disposal in a public park. The court found that the yard can be set up as long as it is maintained properly and does not cause pollution. The court emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy environment and cooperating with authorities in waste disposal. The order also stated that residents cannot expect authorities to find a different location for waste disposal and that it is the duty of the authorities to ensure no nuisance is created for residents.

In yet another court order, a writ petition was dismissed and it was stated that people should cooperate with authorities in maintaining a healthy environment by segregating waste. The authorities are expected to ensure that the Municipal Solid Waste Management Plant/Transfer Station is cleaned regularly and kept in a hygienic condition. The order was addressed to various government officials and there was no order as to costs.

In conclusion, the court orders regarding the construction and operation of compost yards for waste processing in Chennai have emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy environment and cooperating with authorities in waste disposal. While some associations and individuals have sought to prevent the construction of compost yards in their localities, the courts have recognized the need for proper waste management and have suggested measures to ensure that compost yards are maintained properly and do not cause pollution. The court orders have also emphasized the importance of segregating waste and ensuring that Municipal Solid Waste Management Plants/Transfer Stations are cleaned regularly and kept in a hygienic condition.
