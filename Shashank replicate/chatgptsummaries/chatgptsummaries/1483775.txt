The first court order pertains to a case heard by the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal in Mumbai between The Federal Bank Ltd. and Western Paques (India) Ltd. and Sangamner Bhag Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana. The bank had filed a suit for recovery of Rs. 44,21,58,314/- against the defendants, and the court had directed Karkhana to pay Rs. 4 lacs per month to the bank for a period of 25 months. However, Karkhana filed an application to modify the order, claiming that they had incurred expenses towards maintenance and overhauling of the bio-gas plant, which was not taken into consideration while fixing the monthly amount. They also claimed that the bank had not insured the plant comprehensively, which resulted in a breakdown and expenses of Rs. 53,86,984.51.

The bank opposed the application, stating that Karkhana was responsible for maintenance and repairs of the plant and that the bank was not liable to reimburse them. However, the court allowed Karkhana to adjust the expenses towards the monthly amount, exempting them from paying for 25 months. This court order highlights the importance of considering all expenses incurred by a party while fixing a monthly amount for payment. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive insurance coverage to avoid any unforeseen expenses.

The second court order pertains to a dispute between a bank and a company over the running of a plant. The bank had leased the plant to the company, which subsequently sub-leased it to another party. The court found that the sub-lessee was only responsible for day-to-day maintenance and operation of the plant, and not major overhauling or breakdown expenses. The court also rejected the bank's argument that the sub-lessee was seeking a decree in its favor, and upheld the sub-lessee's claim for reimbursement of expenses incurred in maintaining the plant.

The court found that the balance of convenience was in favor of the sub-lessee, and dismissed the bank's appeal. This court order highlights the importance of clearly defining the responsibilities of each party in a lease agreement. It also emphasizes the need for proper documentation and record-keeping to avoid any disputes in the future.

Overall, both court orders emphasize the importance of considering all factors and responsibilities while making decisions in legal disputes. They also highlight the need for proper documentation and record-keeping to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes in the future.
