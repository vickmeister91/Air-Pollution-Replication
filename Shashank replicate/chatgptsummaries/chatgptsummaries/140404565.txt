The Kerala State Waqf Board filed a petition to participate in a complaint brought before the Special Court (Vigilance), Muvattupuzha, alleging misconduct against some former office bearers/members of the Kerala State Waqf Board under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. However, the court rejected the petition, stating that a third party cannot intervene in the functions of the court at this stage. The court also found no instance of jurisdictional error or irregularity for correction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The trial court is yet to take a decision on the report of preliminary enquiry filed by the VACB.

In a separate court order, a petition brought under Article 227 of the Constitution of India was dismissed, stating that the petitioner must wait for proper remedies and procedure under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court also determined that the petitioner, as a third party, cannot intervene in a matter between the complainant and the court until the court has taken a decision on the complaint and report before it. The court ordered the trial court to take its own decision without being influenced by any third party or even the Court. The allegations in the complaint are individually against some former members of the Board, and the VACB has already found that the allegations are baseless.
