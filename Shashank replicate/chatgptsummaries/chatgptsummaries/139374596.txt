In a recent court order, the Rajasthan High Court directed the consideration of an application for environment clearance within six months. The order pertains to a writ petition filed by Surya Kant Gadia against the Union of India, the State of Rajasthan, and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought a direction to grant environment clearance, finalize a draft notification, allow resumption of mining operations, and set aside any pre-judicial order.

The court considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner and the respondents. The petitioner contended that the mining operations were being carried out in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. However, the respondents argued that the mining operations were causing environmental damage and were not in compliance with the applicable laws.

After considering the submissions made by both parties, the court directed the consideration of the application for environment clearance within six months. The court also disposed of the writ petition.

The court's order is significant as it provides clarity on the timeline for the consideration of an application for environment clearance. The order also highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition indicates that the petitioner's claims were not found to be valid. This underscores the need for parties to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims in court.

Overall, the court's order serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental compliance and the need for timely consideration of applications for environment clearance. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in ensuring that environmental laws and regulations are upheld.
