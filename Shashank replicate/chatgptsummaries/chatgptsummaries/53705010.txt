Two court orders have been issued in relation to violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first order pertains to the conviction of Lakhan Nath and Kapil Nath for capturing an Indian Rock Python specified in Schedule-I of the Act. The second order pertains to the conviction of individuals found in possession of python snakes without permission or license.

In the first case, the prosecution presented evidence from five witnesses, including the complainant and wildlife inspector Sh. RS Tyagi. The accused were found guilty of contravening section 9/49/49(B)(1) of the Act. The defense argued that the accused were innocent and that no independent public witness was present. However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be reliable and convicted the accused.

In the second case, the accused were found in possession of python snakes without permission or license, which is a violation of the Act. The prosecution presented evidence from witnesses and documents, and the accused did not provide any defense or explanation for their actions. Therefore, the accused were convicted for the offense and will be sentenced on a later date. The judgment will be sent to the court's website.

Both cases highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and the consequences of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act was enacted to provide for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. It is a comprehensive legislation that aims to conserve and protect India's rich biodiversity.

The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or capturing of any wild animal specified in Schedule-I, II, III, and IV of the Act. It also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any such animal or its parts or products. Violations of the Act can result in imprisonment and fines.

The conviction of the accused in both cases sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate the illegal capture, possession, or sale of wildlife. It also highlights the need for public awareness and education on the importance of wildlife conservation.

In conclusion, the court orders in these cases serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting India's wildlife and the consequences of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act is a crucial legislation that aims to conserve and protect India's rich biodiversity.
