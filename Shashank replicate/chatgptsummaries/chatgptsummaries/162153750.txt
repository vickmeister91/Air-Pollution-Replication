The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a civil writ petition filed by M/s R.K. Enterprises against the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and others. The petition challenged an order passed by the Board, but the court held that since the petitioner had an alternative remedy available, the petition could not be entertained. However, the petitioner was allowed to take its statutory remedy as available in the law, and the Appellate Authority was directed to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing.

The case involved M/s R.K. Enterprises, a company that had been issued a show-cause notice by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board for violating certain environmental norms. The company had responded to the notice, but the Board was not satisfied with the response and had passed an order directing the closure of the company's operations.

M/s R.K. Enterprises had then filed a civil writ petition in the Rajasthan High Court challenging the Board's order. The company argued that the order was arbitrary and illegal and that it had not been given a proper opportunity to be heard.

However, the court held that since the petitioner had an alternative remedy available, the writ petition could not be entertained. The court noted that the petitioner could have filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority under the relevant environmental laws, and that this was the appropriate remedy in the circumstances.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not exhausted its statutory remedy before approaching the court. The court noted that the petitioner had not filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority, and that this was a mandatory requirement under the law.

However, the court did allow the petitioner to take its statutory remedy as available in the law. The court directed the Appellate Authority to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing. The court also directed the Board to cooperate with the Appellate Authority in disposing of the appeal.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. It also underscores the need for companies to comply with environmental norms and regulations to avoid legal action by the authorities.
