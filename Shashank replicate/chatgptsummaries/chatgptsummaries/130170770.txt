The Madras High Court recently passed a court order in a petition filed by Credai Chennai against the Government of India, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The petitioner sought a writ of declaration to declare that the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, are inapplicable to residential construction projects and that the actions of the respondents in applying the same to residential construction projects is unconstitutional.

The petitioner argued that the Acts were meant to regulate industrial activities and not residential construction projects. The petitioner also contended that the application of the Acts to residential construction projects would lead to unnecessary delays and increase the cost of construction. The petitioner further argued that the Acts were not applicable to residential construction projects as they did not involve any hazardous or polluting activities.

However, the court was informed that the construction of residential buildings up to 1,50,000 sq.mtrs. has been exempted from the purview of the Acts. The exemption was granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in 2016. The exemption was granted after considering the recommendations of an expert committee appointed by the Ministry.

The expert committee had recommended that residential construction projects up to 1,50,000 sq.mtrs. should be exempted from the purview of the Acts as they did not involve any hazardous or polluting activities. The committee had also recommended that the exemption should be subject to certain conditions such as obtaining a certificate from the local authority stating that the project did not involve any hazardous or polluting activities.

The court noted that the exemption granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was in line with the recommendations of the expert committee. The court also noted that the exemption was subject to certain conditions which were meant to ensure that the projects did not involve any hazardous or polluting activities.

Therefore, the court closed the writ petition as the petitioner's contention that the Acts were applicable to residential construction projects had already been addressed by the exemption granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The court also noted that the exemption was subject to certain conditions which were meant to ensure that the projects did not involve any hazardous or polluting activities.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the applicability of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, to residential construction projects. The exemption granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change provides clarity on the issue and ensures that residential construction projects up to 1,50,000 sq.mtrs. are not subject to unnecessary delays and increased costs due to the application of the Acts.

The court order also highlights the importance of expert committees in providing recommendations on complex issues such as the applicability of environmental laws to different types of projects. The recommendations of the expert committee were instrumental in the granting of the exemption by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

In conclusion, the court order in the petition filed by Credai Chennai provides clarity on the applicability of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, to residential construction projects. The exemption granted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change ensures that residential construction projects up to 1,50,000 sq.mtrs. are not subject to unnecessary delays and increased costs due to the application of the Acts. The court order also highlights the importance of expert committees in providing recommendations on complex issues related to environmental laws.
