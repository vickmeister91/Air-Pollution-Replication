The Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Textile Processors' Association have filed an application to recall an order from 1995 that required polluting industrial units to set up effluent treatment plants (CETP) and contribute to laying separate pipes and drains to carry treated industrial effluent to Pirana for mixing with treated sewage before discharge into the river. The applicants argue that it was the statutory obligation of the Corporations to lay drainage lines beyond CETP, and the industries could not have been asked to bear the costs of such drainage line. The court is reviewing the direction and considering whether there has been any mistake committed while giving the directions objected to by the applicants.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act related to the discharge of trade effluent from trade premises into municipal drains. The Municipal Commissioner has the power to require the owner or occupier of trade premises to discharge trade effluent in a specific manner and construct a drain for the same. The expenses of constructing such drains are to be borne by the owner or occupier of the trade premises and not the Corporation. The withdrawal of the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) parameter from the standards for discharge of environmental pollutants does not affect the liability of the industries to lay down drainage pipes to reach the contact point with the main drainage or other place legally set apart for the purpose of such discharge by the Corporation. The court rejects the application for review of the decision in Pravinbhai's case related to the same issue.
