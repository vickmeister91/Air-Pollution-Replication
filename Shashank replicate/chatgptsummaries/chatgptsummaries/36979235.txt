The court recently rejected an application by Ganga Sewa Abhiyanam, a non-government organization, to be impleaded as a party in a writ petition filed by M/S Homera Tanning Industries against the Union of India. The applicants argued that their objective of saving the Ganga river from pollution and contamination made them a proper party to the case. However, the court held that their presence was not necessary for deciding the issue involved in the writ petition, which concerned alleged violations of environmental norms by the petitioner-industry. The court also noted that the applicants were not personally affected by the proceedings or the order under challenge in the writ petition.

The case in question involved allegations of environmental violations by M/S Homera Tanning Industries, a leather tanning company located in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The company was accused of discharging untreated effluent into the Ganga river, which is a major source of drinking water for millions of people in the region. The writ petition filed by the company sought relief from an order issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which had directed the company to shut down its operations due to the environmental violations.

Ganga Sewa Abhiyanam, a non-government organization working for the protection and conservation of the Ganga river, sought to be impleaded as a party in the case, arguing that their objective of saving the river from pollution and contamination made them a proper party to the case. However, the court rejected their application, stating that their presence was not necessary for deciding the issue involved in the writ petition. The court also noted that the applicants were not personally affected by the proceedings or the order under challenge in the writ petition.

The court's decision was based on the principle of locus standi, which requires that a person or entity seeking to bring a legal action must have a sufficient interest in the matter to be able to do so. In this case, the court found that Ganga Sewa Abhiyanam did not have a sufficient interest in the matter to be able to participate in the proceedings.

The court's decision has important implications for environmental activism in India. Non-government organizations and other civil society groups have played a crucial role in raising awareness about environmental issues and advocating for stronger environmental protections in the country. However, the court's decision in this case suggests that such groups may face challenges in participating in legal proceedings related to environmental issues, particularly if they are not directly affected by the matter at hand.

The court's decision also highlights the need for stronger environmental regulations and enforcement mechanisms in India. The Ganga river is one of the most polluted rivers in the world, and the country has struggled to address the environmental challenges facing the river and its surrounding areas. The case involving M/S Homera Tanning Industries is just one example of the many environmental violations that occur in India on a regular basis.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Ganga Sewa Abhiyanam's application to be impleaded as a party in the writ petition filed by M/S Homera Tanning Industries against the Union of India has important implications for environmental activism and legal proceedings related to environmental issues in India. The decision underscores the need for stronger environmental regulations and enforcement mechanisms in the country, as well as the importance of ensuring that non-government organizations and other civil society groups are able to participate in legal proceedings related to environmental issues.
