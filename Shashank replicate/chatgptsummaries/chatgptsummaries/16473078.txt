The petitioner in this case has filed a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against the order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Sheopur, and the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Vijaypur, in Criminal Case No. 49/2016. The trial court had allowed the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. preferred by the respondent/accused and directed the petitioner/complainant to produce the documents as demanded by the respondent/accused on record. 

The petitioner argued that the accused can only seek documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. at the time of defence evidence and not before it. The court issued notice to the respondent and stayed further proceedings of Criminal Case No. 49/2016 till the next date of hearing. 

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue such summons or order either on its own motion or on the application of any party to such proceedings.

The petitioner's argument is based on the fact that the accused can only seek documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. at the time of defence evidence and not before it. This is because the section is meant to be used for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The accused can only seek documents under this section when he is preparing his defence evidence and not before that.

The court has issued notice to the respondent and stayed further proceedings of Criminal Case No. 49/2016 till the next date of hearing. This means that the court has put a hold on the proceedings of the case until the next date of hearing. The court has done this to give the petitioner an opportunity to present his case and to ensure that justice is done.

In conclusion, the petitioner has filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Sheopur, and the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Vijaypur, in Criminal Case No. 49/2016. The trial court had allowed the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. preferred by the respondent/accused and directed the petitioner/complainant to produce the documents as demanded by the respondent/accused on record. The petitioner argued that the accused can only seek documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. at the time of defence evidence and not before it. The court issued notice to the respondent and stayed further proceedings of Criminal Case No. 49/2016 till the next date of hearing. This case highlights the importance of following the correct procedures and ensuring that justice is done.
