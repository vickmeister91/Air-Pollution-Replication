Ramkishor had filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, and the revisional court, which had refused to release Tractor No.RJ-11-RA-4286 along with Trolley, to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of case FIR No.17/2018, registered at Police Station Langra, District Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The petitioner had argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the offence and were not required for the purpose of investigation or trial. The petitioner had also submitted that the tractor and trolley were the only source of livelihood for him and his family, and their detention was causing immense hardship to them.

The court, after considering the submissions made by the petitioner and the respondent, allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor along with trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 25,000 with the trial court as a security deposit, which shall be forfeited in case the petitioner fails to produce the tractor and trolley before the trial court as and when required.

In another case, the petitioner, Rakesh Kumar, had filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC at Police Station Kotwali, District Bijnor. The petitioner had submitted that the allegations made against him were false and baseless and that the FIR was registered with malafide intention to harass him.

The court, after considering the submissions made by the petitioner and the respondent, observed that the allegations made against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also observed that the investigation was at a nascent stage and that it was not appropriate to interfere with the investigation at this stage.

The court, however, directed the investigating officer to conduct the investigation in a fair and impartial manner and to complete the investigation within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. The court also directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigating officer during the investigation.

In yet another case, the petitioner, Suresh Kumar, had filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Karnal, whereby the petitioner's application for discharge under Section 239 Cr.P.C. was dismissed. The petitioner was facing trial for the offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC.

The petitioner had submitted that the allegations made against him were false and baseless and that there was no material on record to support the charges framed against him. The petitioner had also submitted that the trial court had failed to appreciate the evidence on record and had erroneously rejected his application for discharge.

The court, after considering the submissions made by the petitioner and the respondent, observed that the allegations made against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough trial. The court also observed that the trial court had considered the evidence on record and had rightly rejected the petitioner's application for discharge.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the trial court to proceed with the trial in accordance with law. The court also directed the trial court to complete the trial within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order.

In conclusion, the courts have been dealing with a variety of cases, ranging from release of seized property to quashing of FIRs and applications for discharge. While the courts have been sympathetic to the plight of the petitioners in some cases, they have also been mindful of the seriousness of the allegations made against them and the need for a fair and impartial investigation and trial. The courts have also been proactive in directing the investigating officers and trial courts to complete the investigation and trial within a reasonable period of time.
