The court orders discussed in this text relate to cases where farmers suffered losses due to tigers destroying their crops. In the first case, the petitioner, Baburao, approached the court to set aside a communication from the Additional Principal Secretary (Forest) declining to grant compensation to him. Baburao had started cultivating banana plants in his agricultural land, which attracted tigers. The tigers made his land their home and one of them killed his cow. The Forest Department paid compensation for the cow, but Baburao also claimed compensation for damage to his plantation and PVC pipes. The Forest Department recommended compensation at Rs. 48 per plant.

In the second case, the Forest Department recommended that the petitioner be compensated for the loss of crops due to tigers inhabiting the agricultural land. However, the Finance Department disagreed and declined to award any compensation. The petitioner's counsel argued that it was impossible to carry out any agricultural operation with tigers on the land. The court observed that the petitioner suffered a loss due to animals and that compensation should be granted. The Finance Department eventually agreed to grant compensation as recommended by the Forest Department. The Government Resolution provides for compensation for farmers who suffer losses due to animals, and specifies the financial aid to be given for different types of damage.

The third court order discusses a case where a farmer suffered losses due to tigers destroying his crops. The Finance Department initially argued that the farmer was not entitled to compensation because tiger attacks were not covered under the government resolution. However, the court ruled that the intention of the resolution was to compensate farmers for losses caused by wild animals, and the omission of tigers did not make a difference. The court also cited the principle of supplying a casus omissus (omitted case) in cases of clear necessity. The court ultimately decided that the farmer was entitled to compensation for his losses caused by the tigers.

The fourth court order states that tigers are considered to be the property of the state or central government, depending on where they have been hunted, under Section 39 of The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Any person who obtains possession of government properties must report it to the nearest police station or authorized officer within 48 hours. Wild animals should be treated as government property for all purposes, and if a wild animal causes loss to an agriculturist or citizen, it is the responsibility of the appropriate government to make good the loss. The petitioner who protected a tigress and her cubs in an agricultural land is entitled to compensation, which should be disbursed within three months.

In summary, these court orders deal with cases where farmers suffered losses due to tigers destroying their crops. The courts ruled that compensation should be granted to the farmers, as the government resolution provides for compensation for losses caused by wild animals, and tigers are considered to be government property. The courts also cited the principle of supplying a casus omissus in cases of clear necessity, which means that even if tigers were not explicitly mentioned in the government resolution, they should still be covered. The courts emphasized that it is the responsibility of the appropriate government to make good the loss caused by wild animals.
