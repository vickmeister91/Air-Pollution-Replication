The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Hindustan Construction Corporation Ltd. (HCC) have been embroiled in a dispute over the Allahabad Bypass Project. The dispute arose from a contract between the two parties, and HCC had filed claims for additional costs incurred due to legislative changes and non-payment for executed work of embankment. The Arbitral Tribunal had passed two awards in favor of HCC, allowing their claims in Dispute Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. NHAI challenged both awards under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

In the first petition filed by NHAI, they challenged the first award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, which allowed HCC's claims in Dispute Nos. 1, 2, and 3. In the second petition, NHAI challenged the second award passed by the Tribunal, which allowed HCC's claims in Dispute Nos. 4, 5, and 7. The court heard arguments from both parties and reserved judgment.

In response to NHAI's submissions, HCC produced a copy of a judgment from a Division Bench of the court in a previous case, which held that the current case is covered by an earlier decision. The court rejected NHAI's submission to await the decision of the Supreme Court in a related case. The court found that HCC's claims for additional costs were covered by the contract and that HCC had provided sufficient documentation to support their claims. NHAI's objections to the claims were rejected.

The court order stated that the Arbitral Tribunal had verified a sampling of documents and found that HCC had lodged claims for additional costs and provided necessary documentation, which NHAI failed to counter. The Tribunal found that HCC was entitled to reimbursement for additional costs incurred due to legislative changes. The court also found that the dispute over non-payment for executed work of embankment was a question of fact based on measurement, and the decision of the majority members of the Tribunal was a possible view.

The court dismissed both petitions filed by NHAI and ordered them to pay costs to HCC. The court's decision was based on the fact that HCC had provided sufficient evidence to support their claims, and NHAI had failed to counter them effectively. The court also found that the Tribunal's decision was a possible view and that there was no reason to interfere with it.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the NHAI vs. HCC case was based on the evidence presented by both parties. The court found that HCC had provided sufficient documentation to support their claims for additional costs and non-payment for executed work of embankment. NHAI's objections to the claims were rejected, and the court dismissed both petitions filed by them. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims in arbitration cases and the need for effective counterarguments to be presented by the opposing party.
