The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) awarded a contract to a contractor for the rehabilitation and upgradation of NH-76 in Rajasthan. During the project, two disputes arose, which were referred to a Disputes Adjudication Board (DAB). The DAB ruled in favor of the contractor, but the NHAI was dissatisfied and invoked the arbitration agreement. The arbitral tribunal made a unanimous award in favor of the contractor for one dispute and a split award for the other. The NHAI filed a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge. The court found no merit in the NHAI's appeal.

In another case, the court order refers to previous judgments in ITD Cementation Limited and M/s OSE-GIL J.V. that cover the same issues raised in the current case. The court dismisses the appellant's argument that the decision in ITD Cementation Limited needs reconsideration by a larger bench. The court also sets aside the majority arbitral award in dispute No. 1, as it is contrary to the contractual clauses. The court explains the different methods of calculating payment for embankment construction and the use of soil and pond ash. The court dismisses the appeal and applications.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the interpretation of a clause in a contract related to the construction of embankments using soil and pond ash. The appellant argues that the rate per cubic metre should be dependent on the quantity of soil or pond ash used, while the respondent argues that two different rates apply depending on whether only soil or both soil and pond ash are used. The DRB ruled in favor of the appellant, but the arbitral tribunal was divided. The appellant argues that the clause itself has been incorrectly reproduced and does not allow for two possible interpretations. The respondent argues that the majority view of the arbitrators should prevail and that the measurement should be made by volume rather than cross-section. The court is asked to adjudicate the matter.

In another case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the measurement and payment for the construction of an embankment using soil and pond ash. The majority view of the arbitral tribunal held that the measurement should be done by taking a composite cross section of the embankment as a whole, while the minority view held that different materials should be measured separately. The court found that the majority view was based on a flawed interpretation of the contract, which provided for only one BoQ item for construction of embankment, but allowed for two methods of construction using either soil or pond ash. The court held that the expression "with pond ash" in the contract referred only to the part of the embankment made of pond ash alone, and not to the entire embankment.

In yet another case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the interpretation of a contract for the construction of an embankment. The court found that the terms of the contract were clear and unambiguous, and that the majority view of the arbitral tribunal was not a plausible interpretation of the contract. The court partially allowed the appeal, directing that the amount due in respect of Dispute No. 3 be released to the respondent along with interest accrued on the said amount, while the amount computed under Dispute No. 1 along with interest accrued thereon be released to the appellant.

In summary, the court orders discussed above pertain to disputes related to the construction of embankments using soil and pond ash. The disputes involve issues such as the interpretation of contractual clauses, the calculation of payment rates, and the measurement of embankments. In some cases, the court found that the terms of the contract were clear and unambiguous, while in others, the court found that the majority view of the arbitral tribunal was based on a flawed interpretation of the contract. The court orders provide guidance on how to interpret contractual clauses and calculate payment rates in similar disputes in the future.
