The case in question involves a criminal charge against the accused, who had filed a petition seeking the transfer of the case from the IV Additional Sessions Judge to the III Additional Sessions Judge in Tirunelveli. The accused argued that the previous judge had already recorded the evidence of all prosecution witnesses and had an advantage in assessing their demeanor. The accused further contended that the transfer of the case would ensure a fair trial.

However, the court found that the accused had already filed several applications and conducted proceedings before the new judge. The court noted that the accused had not raised any objections to the new judge's jurisdiction at the time of filing these applications. The court further observed that the accused was now resorting to forum-shopping, which is not permissible under the law.

The court explained that forum-shopping is a practice where a litigant seeks to have their case heard by a particular court or judge, not because of any legitimate reason, but because they believe that they will receive a more favorable outcome. The court noted that this practice is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the judicial system.

The court also observed that the accused had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the previous judge had an advantage in assessing the demeanor of the prosecution witnesses. The court explained that the demeanor of a witness is not solely dependent on the recording of their evidence but also on their conduct during cross-examination. The court further noted that the accused had not raised any objections to the previous judge's assessment of the demeanor of the prosecution witnesses at the time of recording their evidence.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the petition filed by the accused seeking the transfer of the case from the IV Additional Sessions Judge to the III Additional Sessions Judge in Tirunelveli. The court held that the accused had already conducted proceedings before the new judge and were now resorting to forum-shopping. The court further noted that the accused had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the previous judge had an advantage in assessing the demeanor of the prosecution witnesses.
