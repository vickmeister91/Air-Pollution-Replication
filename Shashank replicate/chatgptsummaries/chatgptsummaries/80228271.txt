The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Ashok Kumar Gupta against the State of Jharkhand and others. The petitioner had sought to quash an order passed in a confiscation case against him. The petitioner's vehicle had been confiscated on the grounds of carrying forest produce without a valid permit. However, the petitioner argued that the vehicle was carrying stone chips from private land and not from the protected forest area.

Upon hearing the case, the court found that the confiscating authority had not determined the factual issue of where the stone chips were being removed from. As a result, the court quashed the order of confiscation and directed the release of the security deposited by the petitioner.

The case highlights the importance of ensuring that factual issues are properly determined before any action is taken. In this case, the confiscating authority had failed to establish where the stone chips were being removed from, which ultimately led to the quashing of the order of confiscation.

It is also worth noting that the petitioner had argued that the stone chips were being removed from private land and not from the protected forest area. This raises questions about the legality of removing forest produce from private land and whether such actions require a valid permit.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the need to ensure that proper procedures are followed and factual issues are properly determined before any action is taken. Failure to do so can result in legal challenges and the quashing of orders, as seen in this case.
