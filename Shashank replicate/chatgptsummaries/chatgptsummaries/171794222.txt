The court considered whether the termination order was valid and whether the petitioner was given a show cause notice. The court found that the termination order was valid as per the contract agreement, which stated that any action for a change of place of posting would be treated as a disqualification. The court also found that the petitioner had admitted to making a request for a change of place of posting, which amounted to a disqualification. The court further found that the petitioner was not served a show cause notice at his residential address, but as the facts of the case were clear, the absence of a notice did not prejudice the petitioner.

The court also ruled that the petitioner has no right to be transferred to a particular BPHC and dismissed the writ petition. However, the petitioner is allowed to file a representation for consideration of reinstatement on contractual engagement in any available vacancy in the BPHCs.

The court order states that the petitioner was charged and the court agrees with the observations of the learned Single Judge. The court also cites a previous case where it was held that a writ need not be issued if only one conclusion is possible based on indisputable factual evidence. The court concludes that the petitioner cannot raise a plea of violation of natural justice as no prejudice was caused to him by non-issuance of a notice.
