The Delhi Pollution Control Committee issued a direction to seal an industrial unit owned by Gopi Nath Pvt. Ltd. The company filed a writ petition seeking to quash the direction. The Committee had previously directed the closure of the unit, but the order was set aside on appeal. The Committee then directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to seal the unit without monitoring it as ordered by the Appellate Authority.

The court considered whether the Committee had the power to issue such a direction under section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the power to issue directions under section 31A includes the power to direct the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry, operation, or process. However, the court noted that sealing an industrial unit would prevent access to and egress from the unit, and thus close entrances, which is much harsher than closure. The court held that the Committee could not seal the entire unit, bringing even unoffending activities to a standstill.

The court ordered the sealing of a unit as the direction of closure had not been followed. The court stated that sealing implies closure but also means more than mere closure. The Committee could take recourse to section 37 of the Act if its direction of closure had not been acted upon. The writ petition was maintainable as the direction to seal the unit was not authorized by the Act and was beyond the powers of the Committee. The court quashed the impugned direction of sealing the unit of the petitioner, but no order was made as to costs.
