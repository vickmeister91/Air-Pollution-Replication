The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by S.P. Muthuraman against the Ministry of Shipping, Government of India, the Central Pollution Control Board, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the District Environmental Engineer of Tuticorin District, and the V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust. The petitioner had sought a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to initiate legal action against the port trust for violating environmental laws and to pay compensation for the damage caused.

The court held that the issue raised by the petitioner falls within the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and dismissed the petition. The petitioner had alleged that the port trust had violated environmental laws by handling coal and other hazardous materials without proper safeguards, leading to air and water pollution in the surrounding areas. The petitioner had also claimed that the port trust had not obtained necessary clearances from the pollution control boards and had not taken adequate measures to prevent environmental damage.

The court observed that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, provides for the establishment of a specialized tribunal to deal with environmental disputes and to provide effective and expeditious disposal of such cases. The court noted that the Act vests exclusive jurisdiction in the National Green Tribunal to hear and decide all civil disputes relating to environmental issues, including enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not approached the National Green Tribunal before filing the writ petition in the high court. The court held that the petitioner should have first exhausted the remedy available under the National Green Tribunal Act before approaching the high court. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for invoking the writ jurisdiction of the high court.

The court held that the writ jurisdiction of the high court is a discretionary power and should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases where there is a violation of a legal right or a legal duty. The court observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for invoking the writ jurisdiction of the high court as the issue raised by the petitioner falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to substantiate the allegations made against the port trust. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a prima facie case for initiating legal action against the port trust and dismissed the petition.

In conclusion, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has dismissed a writ petition filed by S.P. Muthuraman against the Ministry of Shipping, Government of India, the Central Pollution Control Board, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the District Environmental Engineer of Tuticorin District, and the V.O.
