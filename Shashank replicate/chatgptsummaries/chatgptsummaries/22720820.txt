The Allahabad High Court recently passed a judgment in a civil writ petition filed by Ashok Kumar Singh against the State of Uttar Pradesh and others. Singh was appointed as a Legal Assistant in the U.P. Pollution Control Board in 1983 and was later promoted to Law Officer-II. He filed the petition seeking to be treated as senior to Surya Nath Pandey, who was appointed as a Legal Assistant on an adhoc basis in 1977 and was later regularized under the U.P. Regularization of Adhoc Appointment Rules, 1979. Singh also sought promotion as Law Officer-II and Law Officer-I.

The court examined the appointment procedures and regulations in force at the time of Pandey's appointment and regularisation and held that his appointment was made in accordance with the then prevalent procedure and that he cannot be denied the benefit of the service rendered on the post. The court also held that Rule 7 of the U.P. Regularisation of Adhoc Appointments Rules, 1979, will be applicable only to appointments made under the relevant service rules on an adhoc basis and not where there are no rules for making adhoc appointments.

The court order states that the Rules, 1979, will be applicable to adhoc appointments made under relevant service rules. If there are no rules for adhoc appointments, Rule 7 will not be applicable. The appointment of Shri Surya Nath Pandey was not in violation of the prevailing procedure for appointment, and he cannot be denied the benefit of his service. In the absence of rules regulating service conditions, draft rules can be made applicable. Shri Surya Nath Pandey was validly appointed and his service cannot be denied to him, including seniority. The writ petition is dismissed.

The court's decision is based on a thorough examination of the appointment procedures and regulations in force at the time of Pandey's appointment and regularisation. The court found that Pandey's appointment was made in accordance with the then prevalent procedure and that he cannot be denied the benefit of the service rendered on the post. The court also held that Rule 7 of the U.P. Regularisation of Adhoc Appointments Rules, 1979, will be applicable only to appointments made under the relevant service rules on an adhoc basis and not where there are no rules for making adhoc appointments.

The court's decision has important implications for the treatment of adhoc appointments and the application of relevant service rules. The court's ruling that the Rules, 1979, will be applicable to adhoc appointments made under relevant service rules is significant, as it clarifies the scope of the rules and their applicability. The court's decision that Rule 7 will not be applicable where there are no rules for adhoc appointments is also important, as it limits the scope of the rule and prevents its misuse.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of having clear and well-defined rules and regulations for appointments and service conditions. In the absence of such rules, the court held that draft rules can be made applicable. This underscores the need for the government to have clear and well-defined rules and regulations in place to ensure transparency and fairness in appointments and service conditions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a significant one, as it clarifies the scope and applicability of the Rules, 1979, and provides important guidance on the treatment of adhoc appointments and the application of relevant service rules. The decision also underscores the importance of having clear and well-defined rules and regulations in place for appointments and service conditions.
