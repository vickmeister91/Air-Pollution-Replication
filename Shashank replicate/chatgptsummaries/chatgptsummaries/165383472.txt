Dr. Sarojini Tewatia, an associate fellow with the Council for Social Development, filed a writ petition against the Union of India (UOI) and others after being terminated from her position. The petitioner claimed that her dismissal was arbitrary and discriminatory, and that principles of natural justice were not followed. The respondent argued that the termination was in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

The case was heard by the Delhi High Court, which found that the Council for Social Development was substantially funded by the government and was assisting the government in performing public functions. Therefore, it came within the ambit of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, which defines the term "State" to include the government and its instrumentalities. As a result, the court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

The court examined the petitioner's claims and found no substance in them. The court noted that the petitioner had been given several opportunities to explain her conduct, but had failed to do so satisfactorily. The court also found that the petitioner had been given a fair hearing before the decision to terminate her was made.

The court further observed that the Council for Social Development had followed the applicable rules and regulations in terminating the petitioner's employment. The court noted that the petitioner had been appointed on a contractual basis, and that her contract had a clause allowing for termination without notice or compensation in case of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance.

The court also rejected the petitioner's claim that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her gender. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support this claim, and that the Council for Social Development had a policy of non-discrimination.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition, finding no substance in the petitioner's claims. The court held that the Council for Social Development had followed the applicable rules and regulations in terminating the petitioner's employment, and that the petitioner had been given a fair hearing before the decision was made. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support her claim of discrimination.
