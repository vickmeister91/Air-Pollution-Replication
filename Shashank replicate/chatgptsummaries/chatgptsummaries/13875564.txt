The court order pertains to a suit for permanent injunction filed by Vishamber Singh against Delhi Jal Board and NCT of Delhi. Singh claims to be the owner of a property in Delhi and alleges that officials from the defendants threatened to demolish his property without any valid reason. The defendants deny Singh's claims and argue that the land in question was acquired by the government and delivered to Delhi Jal Board for construction of a sewage treatment plant. The court hears evidence from both parties and ultimately finds in favor of the defendants, stating that Singh has no right, title, or interest in the land in question.

The court order states that the plaintiff has no right, title, or interest in the suit property, and that the land in question was acquired by the government for construction of a sewerage treatment plant. The defendant was allotted the land at a rate of Rs.1 per acre and paid Rs.186/- to the DDA. The plaintiff failed to prove ownership of the land and did not produce any evidence to show that the previous owners had a valid title to the property. The plaintiff's possession documents were issued after the land was acquired and possession was handed over to the defendant. The court dismissed the plaintiff's suit and denied the injunction as prayed for.

The court order is a clear indication of the importance of providing evidence to support one's claims in a court of law. In this case, the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence to support his claim of ownership of the property in question. The court found that the land was acquired by the government for a specific purpose and was allotted to the defendant at a nominal rate. The plaintiff's possession documents were issued after the land was acquired, which further weakened his claim to ownership.

The court's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's suit and deny the injunction as prayed for is based on the lack of evidence presented by the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant had a valid claim to the land in question and that the plaintiff had no right, title, or interest in the property. The court's decision is a reminder that it is important to provide evidence to support one's claims in a court of law.
