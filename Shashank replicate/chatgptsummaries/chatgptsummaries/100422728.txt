In a recent court order, a practicing Advocate filed a petition for writ to have an appropriate writ, order or direction for respondents to take necessary steps to ensure protection of standing agricultural crops by invoking authority under Section 11 (1) (b) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner was concerned about the damage caused to crops by protected wild animals and sought a solution to this problem.

The court, after hearing the petitioner's plea, stated that no general direction can be given to the respondents to invoke the powers under Section 11 (1) (b) of the Act of 1972 for general elimination of the protected wild animal. The court suggested that the petitioner and all other affected residents of the area concerned should move appropriate application before the competent authority to have permission as per provisions of Section 11 (1) (b) of the Act of 1972.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, provides for the protection of wild animals and their habitats. The Act also provides for the regulation of hunting and poaching of wild animals. The court recognized the importance of protecting wild animals and their habitats, but also acknowledged the concerns of farmers and other residents who are affected by the damage caused to their crops and property.

The court's decision is significant as it strikes a balance between the protection of wild animals and the concerns of farmers and other residents. The court's suggestion that affected residents should move appropriate application before the competent authority to have permission as per provisions of Section 11 (1) (b) of the Act of 1972 is a practical solution to the problem. This will ensure that the competent authority can take appropriate measures to protect crops and property while also ensuring the protection of wild animals and their habitats.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development as it recognizes the importance of protecting wild animals and their habitats while also addressing the concerns of farmers and other residents. The court's suggestion that affected residents should move appropriate application before the competent authority to have permission as per provisions of Section 11 (1) (b) of the Act of 1972 is a practical solution to the problem and will ensure that the competent authority can take appropriate measures to protect crops and property while also ensuring the protection of wild animals and their habitats. The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
