In the first court order, the complaint filed under Section 13 of the Official Secrets Act, 1929 by Ram Chander Garvan, Inspector of Police, CBI against Ashok Chawla and Vijaya Rajgopal is discussed. The petitioner filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning of documents/reports/final reports before the learned Trial Court. The prayer in the application was not for the supply of documents relied upon by the prosecution but the Final Report-I (FR-I) and Final Report-II (FR-II) prepared by the erstwhile Investigating Officer DSP Ram Chandra who carried out the investigation of the case from September, 1996 to April, 1997. The learned Trial Court dismissed the application of the Petitioner. The petitioner challenged the impugned order dated 30th April, 2010.

Moving on to the second court order, the granting of certiorari when a court has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction is discussed. The case in question involves the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court determines that the accused is not entitled to the production of certain documents as they are not being used against him during the trial. The court also cites previous cases to establish the limited right of the accused to claim copies of documents and the duty of the prosecutor to disclose certain documents in the interest of justice and fair investigation. The court concludes that the supervision notes cannot be used as evidence against the accused and unauthorized access to official records is not allowed.

In the third court order, the supervision notes are discussed. The court directs that the supervision notes are not to be taken note of by any concerned court and should not be made available to any person. The Chief Secretary of each State and Union Territory and the concerned Director General of Police are directed to ensure the confidentiality of the supervision notes. If any official is involved in enabling any person to get the supervision notes, appropriate action should be taken against them. The court also clarifies that the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file and that the transfer of investigation to another officer does not amount to reinvestigation forbidden under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. The writ petition is dismissed.

Finally, the fourth court order was issued by Judge Mukta Gupta on February 28, 2011, in case number W.P. CRL. 1429/2010. The order consists of 20 pages. No information is provided about the content of the order.

In summary, these court orders discuss various aspects of criminal law and procedure, including the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., the limited right of the accused to claim copies of documents, the duty of the prosecutor to disclose certain documents in the interest of justice and fair investigation, the use of supervision notes as evidence against the accused, and the confidentiality of police files. The orders also clarify that the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to every document of the police file and that the transfer of investigation to another officer does not amount to reinvestigation forbidden under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C.
