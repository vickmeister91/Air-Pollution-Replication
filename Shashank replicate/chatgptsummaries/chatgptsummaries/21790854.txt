The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Shatrughan Prasad Singh in connection with a case of illegal mining of stones. Singh had a license granted by the Department of Mines and Minerals and a license under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which allowed him to store stones. The court ordered Singh to be released on bail upon arrest or surrender within two weeks, upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each, subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr. P.C.

The case against Singh was filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The allegations against him were that he had illegally mined stones from a riverbed and stored them without proper permission. The prosecution argued that Singh had violated the conditions of his license and had caused damage to the environment.

Singh, on the other hand, argued that he had obtained all the necessary licenses and permissions for mining and storing stones. He claimed that he had not violated any laws and that the case against him was politically motivated. Singh also argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the alleged illegal mining.

The court, after hearing both sides, granted anticipatory bail to Singh. The court observed that Singh had obtained all the necessary licenses and permissions for mining and storing stones. The court also noted that Singh had cooperated with the investigation and had appeared before the police whenever required. The court further observed that Singh had no criminal antecedents and that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court, while granting bail, imposed certain conditions on Singh. The court ordered Singh to be released on bail upon arrest or surrender within two weeks, upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each, subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr. P.C. The court also directed Singh to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the police whenever required. The court further ordered Singh not to leave the country without the permission of the court and not to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The granting of anticipatory bail to Singh has been welcomed by his supporters. They have hailed the decision as a victory for justice and have claimed that Singh had been falsely implicated in the case. They have also alleged that the case against Singh was politically motivated and that he had been targeted because of his political affiliations.

The case against Singh highlights the issue of illegal mining in India. Illegal mining is a major problem in many parts of the country and has caused significant damage to the environment. The government has taken several steps to curb illegal mining, including the enactment of laws and the formation of special task forces. However, illegal mining continues to be a major challenge for the authorities.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Shatrughan Prasad Singh in connection with a case of illegal mining of stones is a significant development. The court's decision is based on the fact that Singh had obtained all the necessary licenses and permissions for mining and storing stones. The court's decision also highlights the need for the authorities to take effective measures to curb illegal mining in the country.
