On March 10, 2016, the court issued a notice on admission and application for stay to the respondent in the case of Mahendra Engle vs Ghanshyam Yogi. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) for the production of certain records. However, the application was rejected by the lower court. The petitioner's counsel argued against the rejection of the application and requested that the records be produced.

The court directed that further proceedings in Criminal Case No 1442/14 pending before JMFC., Gwalior shall remain stayed. This means that the case will not proceed until the court has made a decision on the application for the production of records. The court also ordered that the process fee must be paid within three working days, or the petition will be dismissed.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner had argued that the records were necessary for the proper adjudication of the case and that the lower court had erred in rejecting the application.

The court's decision to stay the proceedings in the case pending the production of records is a common practice in criminal cases. It ensures that all relevant evidence is available to the court before it makes a decision. The court's order to pay the process fee within three working days is also a standard practice. Failure to pay the fee can result in the dismissal of the petition.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of Mahendra Engle vs Ghanshyam Yogi is a routine procedural matter. The court has directed that further proceedings in the case shall remain stayed until the records requested by the petitioner are produced. The petitioner has been given three working days to pay the process fee, failing which the petition will be dismissed.
