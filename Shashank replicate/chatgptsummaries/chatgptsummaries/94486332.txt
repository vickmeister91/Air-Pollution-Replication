The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by Mahesh Chandulal Solanki and Aniruddhsinh Kakubha Jethava against the Union of India and others regarding the environmental clearance granted to Jindal SAW Limited for the expansion of their plant in Village Samaghogha, Taluka Mundra, District Kutch, Gujarat. The appellants claimed that the expansion would seriously affect the environment and their livelihoods. They also alleged that the process of granting environmental clearance was flawed. The SEIAA of Gujarat State had granted the clearance, and the SEAC had recommended it on certain terms and conditions. The Respondent No. 4 -SEAC Gujarat, resisted the appeal.

The court order discusses an appeal made by the appellant against the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) to the Respondent No. 5 for the expansion of their steel plant. The Respondent No. 4 -SEAC Gujarat, resisted the appeal, and the parties were heard at length. The controversies raised include whether the construction of the project was started prior to the granting of Environmental Clearance, whether the summary of EIA report was not furnished in Vernacular Language, whether summary of EIA report was inadequate and not as required by the Environmental Clearance Regulations /EIA Notification, whether the Public Hearing was not held in neutral venue, and whether there is any contravention of the Environmental Clearance Regulations /EIA Notification. The court order answers these points and concludes that the appeal is dismissed.

The court order discusses several points related to the Environmental Clearance Regulations for a proposed project. The court finds that the project's EIA report was delivered to local authorities and no grievances were raised prior to the appeal. The court also notes that the summary EIA report adequately covers the necessary information and that the Public Hearing was held in a location controlled by the project proponent, which is allowed under the regulations. Overall, the court denies the appeal and upholds the Environmental Clearance for the project.

The court order discusses the importance of public consultation and public hearings in the process of granting environmental clearance for projects. It states that public hearings should be held at or near the project site to ensure participation from those who may be affected by the project. The order also examines the process of granting environmental clearance and finds that the necessary steps were taken in this case, including publishing notices in local newspapers and making the EIA report available to the public. The court also notes that the project proponent began construction before receiving clearance, but stopped after being directed to do so by the SEAC. Overall, the court finds that the necessary procedures were followed and there were no violations of environmental clearance regulations.

The court order discusses the SEAC's examination of a proposed project's categorization and competence, as well as their consideration of various concerns raised during a public hearing. The SEAC applied their mind to the final EIA report and outcome of public consultation before recommending the case for environmental clearance. The court also cites various judgments related to environmental clearance and sustainable development.

The court order states that the Environmental Clearance Regulations need to be examined as they are rules governing the grant or rejection of environmental clearance to projects and activities. The use of mandatory words in the regulations may be construed as directory. The court found that there was no evidence of any lapse in compliance with the regulations that prejudicially affected the course of justice. However, the Project Proponent had started construction before the grant of environmental clearance, which was a violation of the regulations. The Gujarat State Pollution Control Board was directed to monitor groundwater levels and TDS levels every six months and take measures to prevent depletion. The Project Proponent was directed to deposit Rs. 1,00,00,000/- with the NGT within four weeks, which would be remitted to the Environment Relief Fund.

The court examined the process of granting environmental clearance and found that the necessary steps were taken, including public consultation and public hearings. The court also noted that the project proponent had started construction before receiving clearance, which was a violation of the regulations.
