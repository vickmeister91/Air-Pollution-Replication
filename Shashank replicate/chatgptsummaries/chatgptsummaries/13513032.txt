The first two court order summaries relate to a case where a passenger fell from a moving train and died, and his family sought compensation under the Railways Act. The Union of India appealed a judgment by the Railway Claims Tribunal awarding compensation to the parents of the deceased passenger. The appellant argued that the deceased was not a bona fide passenger and was negligent in de-boarding from a running train. However, the Railway Claims Tribunal held the deceased to be a bona fide passenger and applied the principles of strict liability to award compensation. The court upheld the decision of the Railway Claims Tribunal.

The court order discusses the concept of strict liability and the exceptions to when a claimant can be disqualified from compensation. The court found that the passenger was a bona fide passenger and the incident was an untoward incident, entitling the family to compensation. The court dismissed the appeal and directed the bank to keep a portion of the compensation in fixed deposits for the family. The court also released the legal expenses to the family's counsel.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the concept of strict liability in cases of railway accidents. The court held that the railway administration is strictly liable for any untoward incident that occurs during the course of a journey, and the burden of proof lies on the railway administration to prove that the incident was not due to their negligence or misconduct. The court also clarified that a passenger who falls from a moving train is not necessarily disqualified from compensation, and the railway administration cannot escape liability by arguing that the passenger was negligent.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of providing compensation to the families of victims of railway accidents. The court directed the bank to keep a portion of the compensation in fixed deposits for the family, ensuring that they have a steady source of income for the future. The court's decision to release the legal expenses to the family's counsel also ensures that the family is not burdened with the cost of litigation.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case provides clarity on the concept of strict liability in cases of railway accidents and emphasizes the importance of providing compensation to the families of victims. The court's decision to direct the bank to keep a portion of the compensation in fixed deposits for the family and release the legal expenses to the family's counsel ensures that the family is not burdened with the cost of litigation and has a steady source of income for the future.
