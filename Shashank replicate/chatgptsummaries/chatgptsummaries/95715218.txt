The recent court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies challenging the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners argued that the provision, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest without granting a hearing to affected parties, is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. The government, on the other hand, argued that the provision is necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued.

The court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the provision, noting the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover. The court observed that the provision is a necessary measure to prevent the destruction of forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. The court also noted that the provision does not violate any fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.

The court order also discusses various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the protection of forest land and waste land. The provision has been a subject of controversy for many years, with environmentalists and mining companies taking opposing views on its constitutionality.

The court's decision to uphold the provision is a victory for environmentalists who have been advocating for the protection of forest land and waste land. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also a positive development, as it underscores the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court is also a welcome development, as it will help prevent the devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court's decision to suspend mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology is also a significant step towards protecting the environment.

Overall, the court's order is a positive development for the protection of forest land and waste land in India. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle, as well as its decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court, will help prevent the devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is also a significant victory for environmentalists who have been advocating for the protection of forest land and waste land.
