The court order pertains to a criminal revision case filed by M/s. Sukumar Coir Industries (P) Ltd. challenging an order passed by the Revenue Divisional Officer-cum-Sub-Divisional Magistrate under Section 138(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioner was directed not to run the machines attached to the industry until necessary consent was obtained from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The petitioner argued that their industry was categorized as a green industry and did not require an effluent treatment plant. The court heard arguments from both parties and reserved its order.

The court order discusses a case involving a coconut coir industry and the pollution control board. The industry was found to be using chemically non-potable water and not complying with regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately rejected the argument that the industry's categorization as a "white industry" exempted it from regulations. The court also found that the Executive Magistrate was within their rights to pass a final order without first passing a preliminary order.

The court order states that the petitioner industry has been directed not to run machineries until it gets proper consent from the second respondent Board. The order passed by the first respondent under Section 138(2) of the Code would automatically be vanished if the petitioner gets consent from the second respondent Board. The court suggests that the petitioner industry should comply with the conditions imposed by the second respondent Board and once such conditions are complied with, the second respondent Board can clear the petitioner industry to start production. The impugned order shall not stand in the way once the second respondent Board clears the petitioner industry to run. The criminal revision case is disposed of with these directions.
