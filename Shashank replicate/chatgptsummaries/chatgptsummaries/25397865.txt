The Karnataka High Court recently passed a significant order in a criminal petition filed by Sri Imran Ahmed and Sri Shoaib against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners had sought to quash the FIR registered against them for alleged offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Karnataka Forest Act. The court allowed the petition and quashed the FIR, stating that the Forest Authorities could not have registered the FIR for non-cognizable offences without prior permission from the learned Magistrate.

The petitioners had argued that the FIR was registered without any basis and that the Forest Authorities had exceeded their jurisdiction in doing so. They had also contended that the FIR was registered for non-cognizable offences, which required prior permission from the Magistrate. The respondents, on the other hand, had argued that the FIR was registered on the basis of credible information received by the Forest Authorities and that the offences were cognizable in nature.

After hearing both sides, the court observed that the Forest Authorities had indeed exceeded their jurisdiction in registering the FIR for non-cognizable offences without prior permission from the Magistrate. The court noted that the Forest Authorities had not followed the due process of law and had acted arbitrarily in registering the FIR. The court also observed that the offences alleged against the petitioners were not cognizable in nature and that the Forest Authorities had no power to register the FIR for such offences.

The court further held that the respondents were not precluded from taking such action as was open to them in accordance with the law. The court clarified that the quashing of the FIR did not prevent the Forest Authorities from taking appropriate action against the petitioners if they were found to have committed any offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Karnataka Forest Act. The court also granted liberty to the respondents to take such action as was open to them in accordance with the law.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following due process of law and upholding the principles of natural justice. The court has made it clear that the Forest Authorities cannot act arbitrarily and must follow the due process of law while registering FIRs for non-cognizable offences. The court's order also highlights the need for the Forest Authorities to exercise their powers judiciously and not exceed their jurisdiction while taking action against alleged offenders.

In conclusion, the court's order in the criminal petition filed by Sri Imran Ahmed and Sri Shoaib against the State of Karnataka is a significant development in the field of wildlife protection and forest conservation. The court's order reaffirms the importance of following due process of law and upholding the principles of natural justice. The court's order also highlights the need for the Forest Authorities to exercise their powers judiciously and not exceed their jurisdiction while taking action against alleged offenders.
