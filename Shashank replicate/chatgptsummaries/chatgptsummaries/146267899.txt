The National Green Tribunal in India has issued a court order regarding the proposed widening of sectoral roads in Gurgaon, which involves cutting down trees in a green belt area. The order addresses several issues related to environmental protection and sustainable development.

The applicants have filed complaints against the Haryana Development Authority and DLF Ltd. for violating environmental obligations. They argue that the destruction of the green belt would expose residents to severe and incessant pollution, likely causing respiratory diseases and cancer. The court has taken note of the National Forest Policy, 1988, which provides for the maintenance of green belts in urban/industrial areas and arid tracts.

The court has ordered the respondents to stop cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site in question. The court considers whether the disputed land is part of a forest area and whether the compensatory afforestation being done by the Haryana Urban Development Authority is adequate. The court also examines whether an environmental clearance is required for the project and the impact of the project on the environment, including air and noise pollution.

The order cites various legal provisions and international treaties related to environmental protection. The court ultimately rules in favor of the project proponent but orders compensatory afforestation and measures to mitigate noise pollution. The concerned departments are required to submit a compliance report within six months.

The court also addresses the issue of reduced green cover in Gurgaon due to the cutting of trees by HUDA. The court calls for the Forest Department and HUDA to make environmental issues a necessary component of project planning and to undertake afforestation work. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and balancing development with environmental concerns.

The court allows the widening of a road project but imposes environmental safeguards, including afforestation work, noise prevention measures, and internalization of environmental issues in project planning. The court orders the respondents to stop cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site in question. The applicants have argued that the destruction of the green belt would expose residents to severe and incessant pollution, likely causing respiratory diseases and cancer.

In conclusion, the court order from the National Green Tribunal in India regarding the proposed widening of sectoral roads involving cutting of trees in front of the National Media Centre addresses several issues related to environmental protection and sustainable development. The court has ordered the respondents to stop cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site in question and has imposed environmental safeguards, including afforestation work, noise prevention measures, and internalization of environmental issues in project planning. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and balancing development with environmental concerns. The concerned departments are required to submit a compliance report within six months.
