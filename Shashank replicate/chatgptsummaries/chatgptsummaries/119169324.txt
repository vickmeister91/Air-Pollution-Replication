The Madras High Court recently dismissed two writ petitions filed by A. Thambithurai and T. Prabu to quash an undated notice issued by the Sub Inspector of Police under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The notice was issued to Mr. M.K. Ramachandran, who was directed to appear for an enquiry based on a complaint filed by Mrs. Savithiri Sivasamy. The petitioners argued that they had not given any instructions to the respondent.

The court, however, dismissed the writ petitions, stating that they were not maintainable and there was no substance in the submission made in the affidavit. The connected miscellaneous petitions were also closed.
