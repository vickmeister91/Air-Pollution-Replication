The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case between M/s. Ark Nirman Pvt. Ltd. and The State of West Bengal regarding the legality of the petitioner's stone crushing business. The petitioner argued that they had permission from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to operate, while the State argued that the business was located in a buffer zone near a forest and should be shut down.

The petitioner, M/s. Ark Nirman Pvt. Ltd., claimed that they had obtained all necessary permissions from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to operate their stone crushing business. They argued that they had been operating for several years without any issues and that the State's sudden demand for closure was unjustified.

On the other hand, the State of West Bengal argued that the petitioner's business was located in a buffer zone near a forest and was causing environmental damage. They claimed that the business was operating without proper clearance from the forest department and that it was necessary to shut it down to prevent further damage to the environment.

During the hearing, the court suggested that the petitioner seek clarification from the National Green Tribunal regarding the legality of their business. The National Green Tribunal is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and has the power to issue orders to protect the environment.

The court disposed of the writ petition without any costs, indicating that it did not find any merit in the petitioner's arguments. However, the court did not order the closure of the petitioner's business, leaving the matter to be decided by the National Green Tribunal.

This case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions and clearances before starting a business, especially if it involves activities that may have an impact on the environment. It also underscores the need for specialized courts like the National Green Tribunal to handle environmental disputes and ensure that environmental laws are enforced effectively.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's decision to suggest that the petitioner seek clarification from the National Green Tribunal regarding the legality of their business is a step in the right direction. It is important to ensure that businesses operate in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and does not cause harm to the environment. The National Green Tribunal's decision in this case will be crucial in determining the future of the petitioner's stone crushing business.
