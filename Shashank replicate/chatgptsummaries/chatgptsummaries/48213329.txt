The court order pertains to a case (CC No. 298452/2016) filed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) against M/s Village Women Craft and others. The case involves an offense committed on January 25, 2009, and the complainant is Sh. V.K. Dixit, Assistant Director of WCCB, New Delhi. The accused include M/s Village Women Craft and M/s Heritage Textile Handicrafts, along with their partners. Some of the accused have been discharged or acquitted in previous orders. The details of the accused and their addresses are provided in the order.

In another court order, M/s Village Women Craft and Gurvinder Singh Kochar were convicted for contravening Section 49/49(B)(1) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1970, and were punished under Section 51 of the same Act. The offence was proved, and the accused pleaded not guilty. The judgment was passed on 11.10.2019, and the case was instituted on 05.02.2010. The court heard fresh final arguments against the accused Village Women Craft and Gurvinder Singh Kochhar, and the case involved the smuggling of Tibetan Antelope guard hair in shawls.

The court order pertains to a case under the Custom Acts against a consignor who was found to have illegally acquired shawls made from Tibetan Antelope hair. Witnesses, including a complainant and an expert witness, testified and were cross-examined by the defense counsel. The accused argued that no charge was framed against one of them in their individual capacity, but the court found that the error did not prejudice the trial. The court also cited relevant provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Criminal Procedure Code. Ultimately, the court will decide whether to convict the accused and their company.

The court order states that an error in the charge against an accused person does not affect the trial if the charge has been fully explained to the accused. The accused's partnership firm was being managed by him, and therefore, he is liable for the penal consequences for the acts of the firm. The court also explains the liability of partners in a firm and the principle of piercing of the veil. The accused's argument that he was not called during the sealing and seizure of the sample is rejected, and the court examines the admissibility of the accused's statement recorded by the Custom Superintendent. The court concludes that the accused is the person behind the acts of the firm and is liable for the offense alleged in the complaint.

In yet another court order, M/s Village Women Craft and its partner Gurvinder Singh Kochar were found guilty of contravening sections 49 and 49B(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act by exporting Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope without a permit or license. The prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt based on evidence including a confession made by Gurvinder Singh under section 108 of the Customs Act. The court convicted both the company and its partner for the offense punishable under section 51 of the Act. The judgment was announced on October 11, 2019.

The above court orders all relate to cases involving M/s Village Women Craft and its partners, who were accused of contravening various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Custom Acts. The cases involved the illegal acquisition and export of shawls made from Tibetan Antelope hair, which is a protected species under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The accused pleaded not guilty, but the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt based on evidence including witness testimony and confessions made by the accused.

In one of the court orders, the accused argued that an error in the charge against them affected the trial, but the court found that the error did not prejudice the trial. The court also explained the liability of partners in a firm and the principle of piercing of the veil, which holds that a partner can be held liable for the acts of the firm. In another court order, the accused argued that they were not called during the sealing and seizure of the sample, but the court rejected this argument and examined the admissibility of the accused's statement recorded by the Custom Superintendent.

Ultimately, the court convicted the accused and their company for the offenses alleged in the complaints. The court orders serve as a reminder that the illegal acquisition and export of protected species is a serious offense and will be punished accordingly. The Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Custom Acts provide for severe penalties for such offenses, including imprisonment and fines. It is important for individuals and companies to comply with these laws to protect endangered species and avoid legal consequences.
