The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a dispute between the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) and various government bodies over the use of 100 acres of land for solid waste management purposes. The RMC claims to have manifold problems managing solid waste and needs the additional land for future planning of solid waste management. However, the State Government is reluctant to allot the additional land and wants the Corporation to first utilize the land already allotted. The National Green Tribunal has issued certain directions regarding compensation to affected villagers and completion of construction work and facilities for the landfill site. The court has been asked to quash and set aside certain orders and stay the implementation of impugned orders.

In one of the court orders, the RMC was directed to ensure that all units for processing, treatment, and reuse of MSW are operational and compliant with regulations. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) will conduct air and groundwater monitoring and issue appropriate directions to control pollution. GPCB will also report on the status of MSW facilities in the state and take necessary measures for enforcement of MSW rules. The respondents must pay costs to the applicants and bear their own costs. The Supreme Court stayed the order subject to Hanjer Biotech Energies Pvt. Ltd. depositing Rs. 25 lakhs with the Collector, Rajkot. The State filed a reply stating that the petitioner Corporation failed to comply with conditions and utilize the land allotted for solid waste management. The Corporation was directed to deposit the differential amount and pay relevant cess/tax. The additional allotment of 100 acres of land was taken back under the head of State.

Another court order discusses the legal position regarding the distribution of state-owned property and the need for the government to act in the public interest. The case involves the cancellation of an order of land allotment and the petitioner's appeal against it. The court emphasizes the importance of public interest and fair and transparent methods in the distribution of natural resources. The petitioner had been granted 100 acres of land for compost manure and landfill site, but the physical possession was not taken for ten years. The Collector's office is considering a proposal for the allotment of land to GIDC, and the respondent no.1 is mindful of the future requirement of the petitioner for solid waste management purposes. The court denies the petitioner's claims of arbitrary, unjust, illegal, or violative of any legal or fundamental rights.

The third court order pertains to a dispute between the RMC and the State Government of Gujarat over the use of 100 acres of land for a landfill site. The Corporation argues that the land is needed for a public purpose and that the Government should consider this in light of environmental regulations. The court directs the Chief Secretary of the State to resolve the dispute within two months in the interest of public health and safety.

Overall, these court orders highlight the challenges faced by local governments in managing solid waste and the need for cooperation between different government bodies to address these challenges. The court emphasizes the importance of public interest and fair and transparent methods in the distribution of natural resources. It remains to be seen how the various parties involved will work together to resolve the dispute and ensure effective solid waste management in the region.
