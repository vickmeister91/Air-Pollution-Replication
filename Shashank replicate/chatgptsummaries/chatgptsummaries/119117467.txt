On September 10, 2018, the court heard two interlocutory applications. The first application was related to alleged illegal mining in Choursil Reserve Forest, Lalitpur U.P. by Mr. Pooran Singh Bundela, MLA. The mining lease holder raised an issue that the mining lease area and the boundaries of the Choursil Reserve Forest, Lalitpur, U.P. needed to be demarcated. Several IAs were pending, and the court listed the applications to have the views of the learned Amicus on the demarcation of the mining lease area and the boundaries of the Choursil Reserve Forest.

The second application was moved by the Central Coalfields Ltd. in which it was prayed that the applicant may be permitted to continue the mining operations in the broken up area in terms of order dated 12.10.2007. The court listed the application on October 26, 2018.
