The Bombay High Court has ruled that the Municipal Corporation can construct a toilet block near the Gateway of India in Mumbai. The court found that the construction of the toilet block was necessary for the thousands of visitors who visit the area every day. The resolution to construct the toilet block was passed in 1991, and no objections were raised at the time. The court also found that the construction did not violate the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification or the Development Control Rules.

The court noted that the construction was on the existing road and not on the sea-ward side of the existing road, which is permitted under CRZ-II. The court also rejected the petitioners' claim that the Municipal Corporation had acted mala fide in demolishing the existing toilet block near the Taj Mahal Hotel to construct the new one near the Gateway of India.

The court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a new toilet block near the Gateway of India monument in Mumbai. The respondents argue that it is the duty of the Corporation to provide public conveniences and that the new toilet block will improve hygiene and cleanliness in the area. The petitioners argue that the construction violates regulations for the preservation of heritage buildings and that it was done to benefit a hotel owner.

The court ultimately dismisses the petitions, finding no violation of regulations or evidence of malice, and allows the existing toilet block to be maintained alongside the new one. The interim relief is continued for four weeks.

The court's decision to allow the construction of the toilet block near the Gateway of India has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the move, others have expressed concern about the impact on the heritage site. The Gateway of India is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of Mumbai's rich history. The construction of the toilet block near the monument has raised questions about the preservation of heritage sites in the city.

The court's ruling that the construction of the toilet block does not violate regulations has been criticized by some heritage conservationists. They argue that the construction of the toilet block near the Gateway of India violates the regulations for the preservation of heritage buildings. They also argue that the construction was done to benefit a hotel owner, rather than to provide public conveniences.

However, the court found no evidence of malice on the part of the Municipal Corporation and dismissed the petitioners' claims. The court also noted that the construction was on the existing road and not on the sea-ward side of the existing road, which is permitted under CRZ-II.

The court's decision to allow the construction of the toilet block near the Gateway of India has been welcomed by some. They argue that the new toilet block will improve hygiene and cleanliness in the area and make it more convenient for visitors. They also argue that it is the duty of the Municipal Corporation to provide public conveniences.

The court's decision to allow the existing toilet block to be maintained alongside the new one has been seen as a compromise. This will ensure that visitors have access to public conveniences while also preserving the heritage site.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's ruling that the Municipal Corporation can construct a toilet block near the Gateway of India has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the move, others have expressed concern about the impact on the heritage site.
