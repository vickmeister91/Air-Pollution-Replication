In the first court order, the case pertains to a man who died due to electrocution from a high tension electric wire installed by the Rural Electric Maintenance Division. The man's widow and children filed a suit for damages, seeking compensation for the loss of income and pensionary benefits that the deceased would have earned had he not died. The court held that the State has an absolute liability to maintain electric installations in a safe manner and compensate those who are affected by accidents caused by their negligence. The court awarded compensation to the family of the deceased based on correct parameters.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it establishes the principle of absolute liability on the part of the State for maintaining electric installations in a safe manner. This means that the State cannot escape liability for accidents caused by their negligence, and must compensate those who are affected by such accidents. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that electric installations are properly maintained and safe for public use.

In the second court order, the case pertains to a person who was harmed due to non-maintenance and improper electric installations. The court found no issue with the trial court's decision and dismissed the appeal. This means that the compensation awarded to the person who was harmed due to non-maintenance and improper electric installations was upheld by the court.

The court's decision in this case reinforces the principle of absolute liability on the part of the State for maintaining electric installations in a safe manner. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that electric installations are properly maintained and safe for public use. The court's decision in this case is also significant as it upholds the compensation awarded to the person who was harmed due to non-maintenance and improper electric installations, which serves as a deterrent for the State to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

In both court orders, the principle of absolute liability on the part of the State for maintaining electric installations in a safe manner is established. This means that the State cannot escape liability for accidents caused by their negligence, and must compensate those who are affected by such accidents. The court's decision in both cases also highlights the importance of ensuring that electric installations are properly maintained and safe for public use.

In conclusion, the court's decision in both cases serves as a reminder to the State to ensure that electric installations are properly maintained and safe for public use. The principle of absolute liability on the part of the State for maintaining electric installations in a safe manner is established, and the State cannot escape liability for accidents caused by their negligence. The court's decision also upholds the compensation awarded to those who are affected by accidents caused by the State's negligence, which serves as a deterrent for the State to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.
