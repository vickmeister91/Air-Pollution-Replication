The court order summaries provided relate to various disputes over land use and ownership in Madurai District, Tamil Nadu. The cases involve petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking writs of Mandamus to prevent the laying of pathways on private property without prior notice and opportunity, to stop stone quarry operations, and to direct respondents to stop laying a road leading towards a proposed quarry. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued orders based on the evidence presented.

One of the cases involves a petition filed by V. Mahendran against the District Collector, Revenue Divisional Officer, and Tahsildar of Madurai District, as well as other respondents. The petitioner seeks a writ of Mandamus to prevent the respondents from laying a pathway on the petitioner's property without prior notice and opportunity to the petitioner. The court directs the respondents to not lay any pathway in the petitioner's property without prior notice and opportunity, as there is no cart track found in Survey No.30/4 of Rajakkalpatti Village. The court had previously directed an enquiry into the matter and ordered the removal of any encroachment found. The petitioner had filed a writ petition forbearing the respondents from laying the pathway in their property. An Advocate Commissioner was appointed to verify the existence of a pathway in the petitioner's property.

Another case involves a dispute over the existence of a cart track in S.F.No.30/4 of Rajakalpatti Village, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District. The petitioner claims that there is no pathway in their property and seeks directions to prevent respondents 1 and 2 from relying on any pathway. However, the respondents argue that there is a cart track in S.F.No.30/4, which has been in existence since 1920 and is meant for public use. The District Collector has restored the cart track, which was challenged by the petitioner, and it is now available for public use. The court relies on the Commissioner's report and other revenue records to support the existence of the cart track.

In another case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the laying of a new road for the benefit of a quarry owner, which would require the removal of a dense forest and affect the water sources for agricultural operations in a nearby village. The petitioner alleges that the road is being laid solely for the benefit of the quarry owner and that the representations made by the villagers were not considered by the respondents. An Advocate Commissioner was appointed to verify the existence of an existing road in the area, and his report confirms the existence of a road in Survey No.1 of Rajakalpatti village. The petitioner objects to the report, stating that it does not address the District Revenue Officer's report and fails to consider the impact on the check dam and water bodies in the area. The respondents argue that the road is necessary and that the quarry owner has followed all procedures to obtain a license. The court order states that the writ petition filed to prevent the seventh respondent from quarrying activities is not maintainable as the license for running the quarry was granted following all procedures and provisions of both the Central and State Government. The court found no infirmities in granting the license and stated that the writ petition was filed with the intention to prevent quarrying activities due to business rivalry.

The court order summaries also highlight the principles of public interest litigation and the need for genuine cases to be entertained while avoiding abuse of the legal process. The court dismisses a writ petition filed under the guise of public interest litigation as having a malicious and private motive, and states that it is for the government to decide on the leasing of government land for quarry operations. The court also dismisses three other writ petitions and their connected miscellaneous petitions.

In conclusion, the court order summaries provided relate to various disputes over land use and ownership in Madurai District, Tamil Nadu. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued orders based on the evidence presented. The court relied on revenue records and reports from Advocate Commissioners to support its decisions. The court also emphasized the need for genuine cases to be entertained while avoiding abuse of the legal process.
