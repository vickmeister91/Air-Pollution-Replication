The petitioner, Gurjeet Singh, had approached the court seeking a writ of mandamus to direct respondents No. 2 and 3 to close an industry producing mineral water that was allegedly in violation of pollution control laws. The petitioner's counsel argued that the industry was causing pollution and was not complying with the necessary regulations. The petitioner also alleged that the industry was causing harm to the environment and the health of the people living in the surrounding areas.

During the hearing, the court heard arguments from both the petitioner's counsel and the respondents' counsel. The respondents' counsel argued that the industry was not causing any harm to the environment or the health of the people living in the surrounding areas.
