Filatex India Limited, a company engaged in the manufacturing of synthetic yarns, filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court to stop Valsad Jilla Pariyavaram Trust from establishing an industrial unit in village Nani Tambadi, District Valsad. The company argued that the proposed industrial unit would cause environmental pollution and adversely affect the health of the villagers.

The court issued an interim order prohibiting the 12th respondent, Valsad Jilla Pariyavaram Trust, from making any further construction on the land purchased by it. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had granted conditional permission under the Water Act, 1974 and the Air Act, 1981, subject to obtaining necessary approvals from various government departments before starting construction. However, the court allowed the 12th respondent to move before the competent authority to obtain necessary permission as per the conditions imposed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board.

The court directed the Collector, Valsad, to decide the matter on the application of the 12th respondent, taking into consideration the objections raised by the villagers on an early date, preferably within one month. The court also directed the 12th respondent to comply with the conditions imposed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and obtain necessary approvals from various government departments before starting construction.

The case highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the judiciary in ensuring that development activities do not cause harm to the environment and the health of the people. The court's decision to issue an interim order and allow the 12th respondent to obtain necessary permissions subject to compliance with environmental regulations strikes a balance between development and environmental protection.

The case also underscores the need for public participation in decision-making processes related to development activities. The objections raised by the villagers were taken into consideration by the court and the Collector, Valsad, was directed to consider them while deciding the matter. This ensures that the concerns of the local community are heard and addressed in the decision-making process.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Filatex India Limited v. Valsad Jilla Pariyavaram Trust highlights the importance of environmental protection and public participation in decision-making processes related to development activities. The court's decision to issue an interim order and allow the 12th respondent to obtain necessary permissions subject to compliance with environmental regulations strikes a balance between development and environmental protection. The case serves as a reminder that development activities must be carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner, taking into consideration the concerns of the local community and the impact on the environment.
