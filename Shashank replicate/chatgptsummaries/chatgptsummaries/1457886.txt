In a recent court order, the issue at hand was the seizure of a car by Forest Officers in connection with an offense. The petitioner in the case filed an application for interim custody of the vehicle, which was dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate. The Forest Range Officer objected to giving the vehicle to the petitioner, stating that it had become the property of the government. However, the court clarified that the vehicle would only become the property of the government if it is established that an offense had been committed under the provisions of the Act.

The court order further directed that if the petitioner produces documents proving ownership of the car, interim custody must be given to him on furnishing security of immovable property for the value of the vehicle fixed by the Magistrate. This means that the petitioner can get custody of the vehicle if he can prove that he is the rightful owner of the car and can provide security for its value.

The court's decision is based on the provisions of the Act, which state that if an offense has been committed, the property in question can be seized by the government. However, the court clarified that this only applies if it is established that an offense has been committed. In this case, the petitioner has not been found guilty of any offense, and therefore, the vehicle cannot be considered the property of the government.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of innocent until proven guilty. It also ensures that the government cannot seize property without due process of law. The court's direction to provide interim custody to the petitioner on furnishing security of immovable property for the value of the vehicle fixed by the Magistrate is a fair and just decision that balances the interests of both parties.

In conclusion, the court order in this case clarifies the provisions of the Act regarding the seizure of property by the government. It upholds the principle of innocent until proven guilty and ensures that due process of law is followed. The court's direction to provide interim custody to the petitioner on furnishing security of immovable property for the value of the vehicle fixed by the Magistrate is a fair and just decision that balances the interests of both parties.
