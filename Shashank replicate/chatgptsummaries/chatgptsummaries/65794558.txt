The Telangana High Court recently issued two orders related to bank lockers and the rights of family members to access them after the death of the locker holder. In both cases, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners, who were seeking access to the lockers without having to obtain a legal heir certificate.

In the first case, the court ordered that the wife and children of a deceased man were entitled to operate his bank locker, despite the bank's insistence on a legal heir certificate. The court found that the bank's demand for a legal heir certificate was arbitrary and illegal, and that the petitioners did not need to obtain a succession certificate to operate the locker. The court also noted that while writ jurisdiction is generally not exercisable against private banks, there are exceptions when statutory provisions are violated.

The second case involved a petitioner seeking access to a locker previously hired by a deceased person. The bank had refused to allow the petitioner to operate the locker without a legal heir certificate, which the petitioner argued was in violation of Section 45ZF of the Banking Regulation Act. The court agreed with the petitioner and ordered the bank to allow the petitioner to operate the locker upon the production of a court order and a notarized indemnity bond. The bank was also ordered to pay Rs. 5,000 to the petitioners and complete the process within three weeks. Pending miscellaneous petitions were closed.

These orders are significant because they clarify the rights of family members to access bank lockers after the death of the locker holder. Banks often require legal heir certificates as a way to verify the identity of the person seeking access to the locker and to ensure that they are authorized to do so. However, these orders suggest that such requirements may not always be necessary and that family members may be able to access the locker without obtaining a legal heir certificate.

It is important to note that these orders do not apply to all cases involving bank lockers and the rights of family members. Each case will depend on its specific facts and circumstances, and it is possible that a legal heir certificate may still be required in some cases. However, these orders provide some guidance on how courts may approach these issues in the future.

Overall, these orders are a positive development for family members seeking access to bank lockers after the death of the locker holder. They clarify that legal heir certificates may not always be necessary and that family members may be able to access the locker with a court order and an indemnity bond. This is an important step towards ensuring that family members are able to access their loved ones' belongings without unnecessary obstacles or delays.
