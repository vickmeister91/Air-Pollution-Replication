The Supreme Court of India recently considered a case where a company challenged a show cause notice issued to it for re-opening an assessment due to incorrect statements of turnover or sales. The company argued that the notice did not provide a 15-day time period for a response and did not disclose the materials leading to the satisfaction of the authorities. However, the court held that the notice was valid and that the purpose of the notice was to provide an opportunity for natural justice to the dealer.

The court cited a previous case where it was held that the provision of the Act did not mandate the recording of reasons in the notice itself. The court order states that a provision in the Act does not require the reasons for issuing a notice to be included in the notice itself, and failure to do so does not invalidate the notice. The language of the statute determines legislative intent, and the court cannot add anything to a plain and unambiguous provision.

The appellant had the opportunity to file an effective reply and seek further time if needed. The court concludes that the appellant would not be prejudiced by the show cause notice and dismisses the appeal.

The case highlights the importance of natural justice and the opportunity for a fair hearing. The notice provided the company with an opportunity to respond and present its case, and the court found that the company was not prejudiced by the notice. The court also emphasized the importance of following the language of the statute and not adding anything to a plain and unambiguous provision.

Overall, the court's decision reinforces the importance of following due process and providing an opportunity for natural justice. It also highlights the need to carefully consider the language of the statute and not add anything to a plain and unambiguous provision.
