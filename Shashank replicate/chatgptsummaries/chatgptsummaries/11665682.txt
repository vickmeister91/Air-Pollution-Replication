The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Abhilash V against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner was aggrieved with orders passed by the Board revoking his consent to operate an engineering workshop due to inadequate enclosure and signage. The court ruled that the order was appealable before the Appellate Authority and declined jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The writ petition was closed, leaving the petitioner the liberty to approach the Appellate Authority.

The case involved a dispute between Abhilash V and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board over the revocation of his consent to operate an engineering workshop. The Board had revoked the consent on the grounds that the workshop did not have adequate enclosure and signage. Abhilash V had challenged the revocation of the consent by filing a writ petition before the Kerala High Court.

The Kerala High Court, however, dismissed the writ petition on the grounds that the order was appealable before the Appellate Authority. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to entertain the writ petition. The court observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the law, which was to file an appeal before the Appellate Authority.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not exhausted his alternative remedy before approaching the court. The court held that the petitioner could not bypass the statutory remedy available to him and approach the court directly under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court, therefore, declined jurisdiction and closed the writ petition.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court's decision also underscores the need for litigants to be aware of the statutory remedies available to them under the law.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's decision in Abhilash V's case serves as a reminder to litigants that they must exhaust alternative remedies before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court's decision also highlights the need for litigants to be aware of the statutory remedies available to them under the law.
