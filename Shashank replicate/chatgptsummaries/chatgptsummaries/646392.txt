The Madras High Court recently considered a petition to quash a complaint filed against the managing partner of a firm for an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The accused argued that the complaint was not valid as the partnership firm had not been prosecuted and as such there was no proper compliance with section 141 of the Act. The court held that a prosecution against the managing partner alone cannot be sustained and quashed all further proceedings in the case.

The case involved a complaint filed by the complainant against the managing partner of a firm for dishonour of a cheque. The accused argued that the complaint was not valid as the partnership firm had not been prosecuted and as such there was no proper compliance with section 141 of the Act. The accused contended that the complaint was not maintainable as the firm was an essential party to the proceedings and that the complainant had not complied with the provisions of section 141 of the Act.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. Section 141 of the Act provides for the liability of the company in case of an offence committed by it. It states that if the person committing an offence under section 138 is a company, every person who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.

The court observed that the provisions of section 141 of the Act make it clear that in case of an offence committed by a company, every person who was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence. The court further noted that the provisions of section 141 of the Act are mandatory and that the prosecution must comply with them in order to sustain a prosecution against the accused.

The court held that a prosecution against the managing partner alone cannot be sustained and that the firm was an essential party to the proceedings. The court further held that the complainant had not complied with the provisions of section 141 of the Act and that the complaint was not maintainable. The court therefore quashed all further proceedings in the case.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court has held that a prosecution against the managing partner alone cannot be sustained in a case of dishonour of a cheque under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court has further held that the provisions of section 141 of the Act are mandatory and that the prosecution must comply with them in order to sustain a prosecution against the accused. The court has therefore quashed all further proceedings in the case as the complainant had not complied with the provisions of section 141 of the Act and the firm was an essential party to the proceedings.
