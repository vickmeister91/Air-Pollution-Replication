The court order in question pertains to a case between Mst. Suraj Dei and Mst. Gulab Dei. Mst. Gulab Dei had filed a suit in 1920 against Sadhu Saran for arrears of maintenance and future maintenance. A decree was passed in her favor, but the judgment-debtor did not pay the maintenance allowance regularly, and several applications had to be made for execution of the decree. The ninth application was filed in 1944, and the judgment-debtor objected that the application was barred by time.

The question before the court was whether an application filed by Mst. Gulab Dei in 1943 for possession of the property purchased by her at auction could be considered a step-in-aid of execution. The court held that the application could not be considered a step-in-aid of execution as the decree-holder's right to have the property sold and possession delivered to them flowed from their being the highest bidder and not from the decree. The court overruled previous decisions that held a contrary view.
