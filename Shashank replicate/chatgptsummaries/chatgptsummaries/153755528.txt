The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Ganesh H against the Ministry of Environment & Forests and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash a notification dated 17.8.2011 that bifurcated India into five zones and notified Chennai as the place of sitting for the Southern Zone. The petitioner argued that the notification was arbitrary and violative of the principles of natural justice.

The court, however, disposed of the petition as the petitioner did not press for any order at this stage and instead sought to make an appropriate representation to the authorities concerned for a Bench of the National Green Tribunal at Bangalore. The court noted that the petitioner had not challenged the constitutionality of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore, it was not open to the petitioner to challenge the notification on the ground that it was violative of the Act.

The court further observed that the notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forests in exercise of its powers under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore, it was not open to the court to interfere with the same. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any representation to the authorities concerned before approaching the court and therefore, the court could not entertain the petition.

The court, however, granted liberty to the petitioner to make an appropriate representation to the authorities concerned for a Bench of the National Green Tribunal at Bangalore. The court also directed the authorities concerned to consider the representation made by the petitioner in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the representation.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Ganesh H against the Ministry of Environment & Forests and other respondents. The court disposed of the petition as the petitioner did not press for any order at this stage and instead sought to make an appropriate representation to the authorities concerned for a Bench of the National Green Tribunal at Bangalore. The court granted liberty to the petitioner to make an appropriate representation to the authorities concerned and directed the authorities concerned to consider the representation made by the petitioner in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the representation.
