The court order pertains to two criminal revision petitions against an order passed by the Ld. Trial Court, whereby charge for offences punishable under Section 51 read with Section 49 and 49(B)(1) of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was framed against the petitioners in proceedings arising out of a criminal complaint. The court heard arguments from both sides and observed that if the materials placed before the court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly explained, the court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial. The court found that a grave suspicion exists about the involvement of the accused in the crime alleged and upheld the order of the Ld. Trial Court.

The court order discusses the process of determining whether a case has sufficient grounds for trial. The judge must assess the evidence and documents presented, but should not weigh the evidence as if conducting a trial. The court must exercise judicial mind to determine if a case for trial has been made out. The sufficiency of grounds takes into account the nature of evidence recorded by the police or documents produced before the court. The court also addresses objections to the competency of the officer presenting the criminal complaint and discrepancies in evidence about the sealing of the animal skin. The court ultimately dismisses the revision petitions and returns the trial court record.
