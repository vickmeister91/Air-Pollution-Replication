The petitioners argued that these statements were crucial to their defense and that they had a right to access them under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973. However, the learned Sessions Judge had rejected their application, which led the petitioners to challenge the judgement and order in the higher court.

During the hearing, both sides presented their arguments before the court. The petitioners argued that the statements of witnesses were crucial to their defense and that they had a right to access them under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973.
