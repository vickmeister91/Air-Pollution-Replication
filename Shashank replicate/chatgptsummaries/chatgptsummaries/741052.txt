The Rajasthan High Court recently issued an order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 9685/2009, which involved a challenge by M/s. Rao Jogendra Grit Udhyog to an order passed by the Raj State Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the Board alone is empowered under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the order had been passed by the Member Secretary, who had not been delegated the power to do so. As a result, the court issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders.

The case involved a challenge to an order passed by the Raj State Pollution Control Board, which had been issued by the Member Secretary. The petitioner, M/s. Rao Jogendra Grit Udhyog, argued that the order was invalid because the Member Secretary did not have the power to issue it. The court agreed with this argument, noting that the Board alone is empowered under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, to issue such orders.

The court also noted that the Member Secretary had not been delegated the power to issue the order in question. As a result, the court issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders. This means that the order will not be enforced until the court has had a chance to fully consider the matter and issue a final ruling.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and ensuring that those who are empowered to make decisions are the ones who actually make them. In this case, the court found that the Member Secretary did not have the power to issue the order in question, and as a result, the order was stayed until further notice. It remains to be seen what the final outcome of this case will be, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and ensuring that those who are empowered to make decisions are the ones who actually make them.
