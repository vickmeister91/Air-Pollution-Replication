The National Green Tribunal recently heard four appeals related to construction activities undertaken by M/S Hubtown Limited for two housing societies formed by slum dwellers. The appeals were filed against the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, the Union of India, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority, and the State of Maharashtra. The proposed redevelopment projects were not approved by the Ministry of Environment & Forests due to the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991, which reserved the plots for gardens. 

The appellants challenged the decision before the National Coastal Zone Management Authority and the High Court of Bombay, but their appeals were not maintainable. The court dismissed two appeals as not maintainable and allowed delay condonation applications in the other two appeals. The court also held that the impugned decisions were appealable orders under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act.

The court order states that certain decisions made by the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) regarding the rejection of proposals for projects are appealable orders under the National Green Tribunal Act. The court found that the NCZMA and MoEF did not provide sufficient reasons for their decisions and ignored certain notifications and facts. 

The court partially allowed two appeals and directed the MoEF to take a fresh decision based on the observations made. The other two appeals were dismissed, and no costs were awarded. The court order pertains to the dispute over the redevelopment of two housing societies formed by slum dwellers in Mumbai. The appeals were clubbed together for a common hearing and decision to avoid repetition of facts and overlapping consideration of documents. The judgment was made to dispose of the appeals.
