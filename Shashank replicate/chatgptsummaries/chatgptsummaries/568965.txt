The Orissa High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by the wife and children of a man who died due to electrocution. The petitioners claimed compensation from the Grid Corporation of Orissa Ltd. for the death of the deceased, which they attributed to the corporation's negligence. The court found that the corporation was statutorily responsible for the energy supply in the locality where the accident occurred and that the death was due to electrocution from a live wire that had snapped and was lying on the path. The court applied the principle of strict liability and held that the corporation was liable to compensate the petitioners. The court also rejected the corporation's argument that the petitioners should have approached the civil court instead of filing a writ petition.

The court order states that monetary compensation for the infringement of the right to life is a useful remedy for the family of the victim, who may have been the breadwinner of the family. The court finds that the writ petition is maintainable and the opposite parties are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The court determines the compensation to be Rs. 1.25 lakhs with simple interest. The writ petition is partly allowed.

The court's decision is based on the principle of strict liability, which holds that a person or entity is responsible for any harm caused to another person or entity, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. In this case, the court found that the corporation was statutorily responsible for the energy supply in the locality where the accident occurred and that the death was due to electrocution from a live wire that had snapped and was lying on the path.
