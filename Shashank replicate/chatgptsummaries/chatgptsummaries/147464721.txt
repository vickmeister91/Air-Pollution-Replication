The court order pertains to a criminal revision application filed by two accused against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge-7, Nashik, rejecting their application in a case where a person committed suicide and blamed his classmate and her family for defaming and harassing him. The accused, who are not related to the classmate, are political leaders who contested against the father of the deceased in the assembly election of 2017. The court found that there was no evidence to frame charges against the accused under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code and that the allegations made by the first informant and other witnesses were inconsistent and lacked material evidence. Therefore, the court discharged the accused.
