The Jammu & Kashmir High Court recently dismissed a petition challenging e-auction notices issued by the District Mineral Officers of different districts. The petitioner claimed to have participated in an earlier auction and was the highest bidder, but the process was not completed due to new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The petitioner argued that the e-auction notices were illegal as pre-embedded clearances mandated by the government had not been obtained. However, the court found that the petitioner had not participated in the impugned e-auctions and had not raised any grievance before any authority. The court also noted that the guidelines for e-auction with pre-embedded clearances were issued after the impugned e-auction notices had already been floated. The court dismissed the petition, stating that it lacked bona fide.

The court order clearly states that the power to frame statutory rules for minor minerals is reserved exclusively for the State Government, and the government has already promulgated the rules in terms of SRO 105 of 2016. The Ministry's guidelines can only be treated as instructions to remodel the rules. The writ petition has no merit and is dismissed. The order is reportable, and the accuracy and integrity of the document are attested.
