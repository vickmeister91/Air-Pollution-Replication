The Jharkhand High Court has ordered the State Pollution Control Board to assess pollution levels in areas where stone crushers operate, particularly in clusters, and report on the compliance of conditions of Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate. The court has also required the State to provide details of steps being taken to enforce industrial laws related to stone crushing activities. The matter will appear again on May 15, 2018, and affidavits from the State and Pollution Control Board must be on record by then. The court has also requested concrete instances relating to the issues involved to assist in the proceedings.

The order comes in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a resident of Ranchi, who alleged that stone crushing units were operating in violation of environmental norms and causing pollution in residential areas. The petitioner had sought the court's intervention to ensure that the State Pollution Control Board takes action against the errant units.

The court has directed the State Pollution Control Board to conduct a comprehensive survey of all stone crushing units in the state and submit a report on the pollution levels in the areas where they operate. The report should also include details of the measures being taken by the units to control pollution and comply with the conditions of Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate.

The court has also asked the State to provide details of the steps being taken to enforce industrial laws related to stone crushing activities. The State has been directed to submit an affidavit detailing the action taken against units found to be violating environmental norms and the penalties imposed on them.

The court has emphasized the need for concrete instances relating to the issues involved to assist in the proceedings. The petitioner has been asked to provide specific instances of pollution caused by stone crushing units in residential areas. The court has also requested the Pollution Control Board to provide details of the action taken against units found to be violating environmental norms.

The court has set a deadline of May 15, 2018, for the submission of affidavits by the State and Pollution Control Board. The matter will appear again on that date for further hearing.

The order is significant as it highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental norms in the state. Stone crushing units have been a major source of pollution in residential areas, and the court's intervention is expected to bring relief to the affected residents.

The court's directive to the Pollution Control Board to conduct a comprehensive survey of all stone crushing units in the state is a welcome move. The survey will help identify units that are operating in violation of environmental norms and take action against them.

The court's emphasis on concrete instances relating to the issues involved is also significant. It will help the court to understand the extent of pollution caused by stone crushing units in residential areas and take appropriate action to address the issue.

Overall, the court's order is a step in the right direction towards ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment in the state. It is hoped that the State Pollution Control Board will take the necessary action to enforce environmental norms and ensure that stone crushing units operate in compliance with the conditions of Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate.
