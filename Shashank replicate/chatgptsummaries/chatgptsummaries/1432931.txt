In the first court order, the appellants, who were tenants running a religious bookshop, challenged the judgment of the Bombay High Court dismissing their writ petition. The appellants argued that Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 had no application to their case, but the High Court did not accept their plea. The court explained that Section 133 deals with public nuisance and is intended to prevent public nuisance and protect the public as a whole against inconvenience. The court also clarified the difference between Section 133 and Section 144 of the Code and highlighted that the former is more specific while the latter is more general. Ultimately, the court found no infirmity in the High Court's order.

The case revolved around the interpretation of Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The appellants argued that their case did not fall under the purview of Section 133, which deals with public nuisance. They contended that they were running a religious bookshop and were not causing any public nuisance. However, the High Court dismissed their writ petition, stating that Section 133 applied to their case.

The Supreme Court, in its order, upheld the High Court's decision. The court explained that Section 133 was intended to prevent public nuisance and protect the public as a whole against inconvenience. The court also clarified the difference between Section 133 and Section 144 of the Code. Section 133 is more specific and deals with public nuisance, while Section 144 is more general and deals with the power to issue orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger.

The court further explained that the power under Section 133 is preventive in nature and is intended to prevent public nuisance before it occurs. The court noted that the power under Section 133 is discretionary and can be exercised only if the magistrate is satisfied that there is a likelihood of public nuisance. The court also observed that the power under Section 133 is not absolute and is subject to the principles of natural justice.

In the second court order, the case of Kachrulal Bagirath Agrawal v. State of Maharashtra was disposed of. The court order stated that the High Court's order in the case was valid and did not require any further action. The order was issued on April 15, 2009, and was signed by three judges.

The case of Kachrulal Bagirath Agrawal v. State of Maharashtra revolved around the interpretation of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The case concerned a cheque that was dishonored by the bank. The appellant, Kachrulal Bagirath Agrawal, had issued the cheque to the respondent, State of Maharashtra, as payment for goods supplied to him. However, the cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds.

The respondent filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which deals with the dishonor of cheques. The appellant challenged the complaint, stating that the cheque was issued as security and not as payment. The appellant also contended that the respondent had not supplied the goods as per the agreement.

The trial court found the appellant guilty and convicted him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The appellant appealed to the High Court, which upheld the trial court's decision. The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court, in its order, upheld the High Court's decision. The court observed that the appellant had issued the cheque as payment for the goods supplied to him. The court noted that the appellant had not raised any objection to the quality or quantity of the goods supplied. The court also observed that the appellant had not raised any objection to the payment terms.

The court further observed that the dishonor of the cheque was due to insufficient funds. The court noted that the appellant had not denied issuing the cheque or that the cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The court also observed that the appellant had not made any efforts to make the payment after the cheque was dishonored.

In conclusion, the two court orders dealt with different cases and issues. The first court order pertained to the interpretation of Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, while the second court order dealt with the dishonor of a cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts in both cases.
