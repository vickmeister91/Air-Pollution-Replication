The court recently granted bail to two individuals, Khushal Bansal and Kallu Alias Tularam, who were accused of hunting a wild boar and sharing it with each other, an act that is prohibited under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants had been in custody since July 28, 2019, and claimed innocence. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case, taking into consideration that the co-accused persons had already been granted bail and the applicants had no criminal antecedents.

The court ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount and comply with certain conditions. Failure to comply with these conditions would result in the bail being cancelled. The court did not provide details on what these conditions were.

It is important to note that the court did not comment on the merits of the case, meaning that the guilt or innocence of the accused individuals has not been determined. The granting of bail simply means that the accused individuals are allowed to be released from custody while the case is ongoing.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law in India that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violations of this act can result in fines and imprisonment.

In this case, the accused individuals were allegedly involved in the hunting of a wild boar, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. It is unclear how the authorities became aware of this alleged act or what evidence they have against the accused individuals.

The granting of bail to the accused individuals is not uncommon in India, as the legal system allows for individuals to be released from custody while the case is ongoing. However, the conditions of the bail must be met in order for the accused individuals to remain out of custody.

Overall, the court granted bail to Khushal Bansal and Kallu Alias Tularam, who were accused of hunting a wild boar and sharing it with each other, an act that is prohibited under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court did not comment on the merits of the case and allowed the bail application based on the fact that the co-accused persons had already been granted bail and the applicants had no criminal antecedents. The applicants were ordered to comply with certain conditions and furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each with one solvent surety each in the like amount. Failure to comply with these conditions would result in the bail being cancelled.
