The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by Jan Chetna and Rajesh Tripathi against the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, and M/s Scania Steel & Power Ltd. The appeal challenged the grant of environment clearance to Scania for the expansion of its sponge iron plant without a public hearing. Scania argued that the appellants had no locus standi to file the appeal and that the expansion project was exempt from public consultation. The tribunal heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a dispute over the granting of environmental clearance (EC) to Scania for the expansion of its plant. The appellants argue that the expansion proposal should have undergone public consultation as mandated by the EIA Notification of 2006. They also argue that the proposed units are independent and should be assessed according to the norms stipulated for granting EC for any new project. The respondent argues that the proposal is only for expansion and does not require public consultation. The court is asked to determine whether the EC granted to Scania is valid and whether the appellants have the locus standi to file the appeal.

The court order discusses an appeal filed under the NEAA Act, 1997, challenging the environmental clearance granted to Scania for the expansion of an existing Sponge Iron Unit. The court examines the principles of sustainable development and the constitutional and statutory provisions related to environmental protection. The court also considers the question of locus-standi and the controversies involved in the appeal, including whether the proposal satisfies the requirements of Clause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006, and whether the authorities have duly applied their mind to the facts and circumstances. The court ultimately dismisses the appeal.

The court order discusses the right to appeal an order granting environmental clearance. Any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of environmental clearance has the right to file an appeal. This includes associations of persons who work in the field of environment. The definition of "person aggrieved" cannot be considered in a restricted manner and its scope and meaning depends on the aims and objectives of the statute. The court also discusses a dispute involving a similar controversy and concludes that the appellants satisfy the definition of "person aggrieved" and have the right to file an appeal. The court also discusses the mandatory requirement of prior environmental clearance for certain projects or activities.

The court order discusses the requirement for environmental impact assessments before any construction work or land preparation is started on a project. It emphasizes the importance of public consultation and the right of citizens to know about government affairs related to the environment. The order also examines the exemption of public consultation for a proposed expansion of an existing Sponge Iron unit, concluding that the exemption cannot be granted as the existing unit did not obtain prior environmental clearance under the EIA Notification 2006.

The court order discusses the applicability of Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, which exempts public consultation for expansion or modernization of existing units that have already undergone public consultation during prior environmental clearance. The court finds that this exemption does not apply to the proposed expansion of an existing Sponge Iron Unit, as no environmental clearance has been granted for it. The court also examines the correctness of the EIA report and finds infirmities in the data reported. The court directs the MoEF to examine the water balance and develop a mechanism to check the authenticity of environmental data reported in the EIA/EMP report. The court also directs the MoEF to conduct public consultation for the proposed projects. However, the court does not cancel the environmental clearance granted to the petitioner.

The court has directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to conduct a public consultation (Public Hearing) for proposed projects at or near the site as per the provisions contained in the EIA Notification, 2006. Until this exercise is completed, the EC granted on 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion of Integrated Steel Plant and Captive Power Plant at Village Kunjipatra, District Raigarh, Chhattisgarh by M/s. Scania Steel & Power Limited, shall remain suspended. The MoEF shall take prompt steps for completing the exercise of public consultation and curing the deficiency in EIA/EMP, and re-visit the entire project in the light of the observations made by the court. The EC granted would be subject to the decision to be taken by the MoEF after public consultation and other directions.

The court orders discussed above revolve around the environmental clearance granted to Scania Steel & Power Ltd for the expansion of its sponge iron plant in Chhattisgarh. The appeals were filed by Jan Chetna and Rajesh Tripathi, challenging the grant of environmental clearance to Scania for the expansion of its sponge iron plant without a public hearing. The appeals were heard by the National Green Tribunal, which reserved judgment after hearing arguments from both sides.

The court orders discuss various aspects of the appeals, including the requirement for public consultation, the right to appeal an order granting environmental clearance, and the applicability of Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006. The court also examines the principles of sustainable development and the constitutional and statutory provisions related to environmental protection.

The court orders also discuss the question of locus standi and the controversies involved in the appeals, including whether the proposal satisfies the requirements of Clause-7(ii) of EIA
