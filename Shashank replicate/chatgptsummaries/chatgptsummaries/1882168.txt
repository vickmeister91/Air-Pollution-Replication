The court order pertains to a civil appeal filed by K. Balakrishnan Nambiar and two others against the State of Karnataka and others regarding the renewal of leasehold rights for land in Aletti village. The original lease was granted in 1949 for a period of 50 years for the purpose of raising areca nut plantation. The appellant had applied for renewal of the lease, but the State Government cancelled the lease and directed the appellant to hand over possession of the land back to the forest department. The court examined the reasons given by the State Government for cancelling the lease and dismissed the appeal.

The court order states that 48 acres of leased land should be taken back by the Forest Department, and the remaining 27 acres should not have their lease extended and should also be taken back by the department. The appellant, who had leased the land, appealed the decision, arguing that their activities on the land did not violate any conditions of the lease and that the land had lost its character as forest land. However, the State argued that the land was part of a reserved forest and could not be used for non-forest activities. The High Court upheld the decision, citing a previous judgment that no forest area should be used for non-forest activities. The State's policy is to not continue the lease of any forest land in order to maintain environmental stability and preserve ecological balance.

The court order states that the State Government rejected the appellant's claim after considering the legal position and potential hardship. The court considered the submissions made by both parties and concluded that the leasehold land is surrounded by thick forest and extending the lease period could cause problems for movement and development of naturally grown forests. The court cites the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which applies to all forests regardless of ownership or classification. The court also issued a specific direction to all State Governments to ensure the cessation of all non-forest activities within any forest without prior approval from the Central Government. The court also addressed the appellant's argument that the lease cannot be automatically cancelled upon promulgation of the 1980 Act, which has already been answered in a previous case. The court culled out certain principles pertaining to the conservation of forests in India.

The court order states that the 1980 Act is applicable to all forests regardless of ownership or classification, and after its enforcement, no state government or authority can permit the use of forest land for non-forest purposes or grant leases to private entities. The court also notes that any non-forest use of land prior to the enforcement of the Act cannot be extended without prior approval from the Central Government. The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
