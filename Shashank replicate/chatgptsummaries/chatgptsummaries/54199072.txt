In a recent court order, the Karnataka High Court addressed a writ petition filed by M/s Chamundi Granites against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate a stone crushing unit. 

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and allowed the petition. The court quashed the closure notice and directed the respondents to permit the operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until such time its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on several factors. First, the court found that the petitioner had a valid license to operate the stone crushing unit. Second, the court noted that the petitioner had submitted an application to the competent authority to operate the unit, but the application had not been considered or disposed of. Third, the court found that the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was not in accordance with the law.

The court's decision has significant implications for the petitioner and other similarly situated parties. By allowing the petitioner to operate the stone crushing unit, the court has ensured that the petitioner's business can continue without interruption. Additionally, the court's decision sets a precedent for other parties who may face similar closure notices from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.

It is important to note that the court's decision is not a blanket approval of all stone crushing units. Rather, the court's decision was based on the specific facts of this case. The court found that the petitioner had a valid license and had submitted an application to operate the unit, but the application had not been considered or disposed of. The court's decision was also based on the fact that the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was not in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the law. The court's decision ensures that the petitioner's business can continue without interruption and sets a precedent for other similarly situated parties. It is important for all parties to understand the legal requirements for operating stone crushing units and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
