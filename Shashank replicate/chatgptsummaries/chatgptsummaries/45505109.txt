The court order in question is related to a writ petition filed by Shree Balaji Agro Farm Industries Pvt. Ltd. The petitioner had sought direction from the respondents to consider their application for grant of capital subsidy and release the first installment of the subsidy under the Jharkhand Food Processing Industry Policy, 2015. The petitioner had already obtained consent to establish from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and had invested 50% of the envisaged project cost.

The Director shall take appropriate decision by way of a speaking order within a period of 12 weeks from the date of filing of the representation.

The court order is significant as it provides a clear direction to the petitioner on how to proceed with their application for grant of capital subsidy. The court has also set a timeline for the Director to take a decision on the matter, which ensures that the petitioner's application is not left pending indefinitely.

The Jharkhand Food Processing Industry Policy, 2015, is aimed at promoting the food processing industry in the state. The policy provides for various incentives and subsidies to encourage investment in the sector. The capital subsidy is one such incentive that is provided to eligible applicants.

The court has also directed the Director to take appropriate decision by way of a speaking order within a period of 12 weeks from the date of filing of the representation. This ensures that the petitioner's application is not left pending indefinitely and that a decision is taken within a reasonable time frame.

In conclusion, the court order in question provides a clear direction to the petitioner on how to proceed with their application for grant of capital subsidy. The court has also set a timeline for the Director to take a decision on the matter, which ensures that the petitioner's application is not left pending indefinitely. The order is significant as it ensures that the Jharkhand Food Processing Industry Policy, 2015, is implemented effectively and that eligible applicants receive the incentives and subsidies provided under the policy.
