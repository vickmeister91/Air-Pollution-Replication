The court has issued several orders pertaining to allegations of fabrication of court records and violation of the Environment (Protection) Act. In one case, Kaptan Singh filed an application under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, alleging that the SDM Model Town had prepared a bogus and forged proceeding sheet in which he showed Singh's presence in his office and forged his signatures. Singh also received a notice under Section 5/15 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which he claims was fabricated by the SDM. The court issued notices to the SDM and made inquiries, but the SDM did not appear before the court and warrants were issued against him. The court observed that the proceeding sheet dated 15.12.2011 was allegedly fabricated and inserted to legalize the orders passed by the SDM.

In another case, the court ordered an inquiry into allegations of fabrication of judicial records by two SDMs. The applicant alleged that the SDMs created forged and fabricated order sheets to bypass a court order, and the witness denied signing any such proceedings. The previous SDM testified that he prepared the proceedings and that the complainant had appeared before him and signed them. The court allowed for further inquiry into the matter.

In a third case, the court heard testimony from a witness, Kaptan Singh, who was on medical leave during a court hearing. The witness denied receiving any summons or telephonic information to appear before the court, except for one instance when he was asked to appear by the government counsel. The witness also denied allegations of fabricating records and colluding with others to cover up illegal activities. The court also heard from another witness who testified about complaints against an illegal borewell and subsequent orders issued by the SDM. The witness admitted to irregularities in the numbering of order sheets but denied any wrongdoing.

In a fourth case, the court discussed the testimony of witnesses in a case involving allegations of fabrication of court records. The witnesses included an SDM who denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the pagination of the records was not done by him. The court noted that the SDM who was present during the alleged fabrication had not appeared in court. The court also noted that the record of the SDM showed a page with proceedings dated 15.12.2011, which was not present when the case was initially dealt with. The court suspected that this page was fabricated and inserted later to legalize the orders passed by the SDM. The court also noted that the signatures of the petitioner on the page did not match his admitted signatures. The court concluded that there was a prima facie case of forgery and fabrication of court records.

In another case, the court found that the competent authority, in this case the SDM, did not follow the proper procedure established by law in initiating proceedings against the revisionist under the Environment (Protection) Act. The record did not reflect any proceedings conducted by the SDM before passing the impugned order, and no notice was given to either the complainant or the revisionist. The court found that the proceedings were conducted in a shocking manner and ordered that the revisionist be given an effective opportunity of being heard before a final order could be passed.

Finally, the court set aside an order passed by the SDM for removal of a bore-well/tube-well without proper evidence of misuse or drawing of water in violation of the Environment (Protection) Act. The subsequent proceedings conducted by the then SDM on the same proceeding sheet containing the previous proceedings were found to be irregular and in violation of procedures prescribed. The court refrained from making any observations on the legality of the sealing order passed by the SDM after 1.3.2013, which is already under challenge before another court. The court directed the Ld. CMM (North) to consider the observations made and, if deemed fit, to direct registration of a case and investigations thereof against violators in accordance with the law. The application filed by Kaptan Singh was disposed of.

In summary, the court has issued several orders related to allegations of fabrication of court records and violation of the Environment (Protection) Act. The court has allowed for further inquiry into some cases and found prima facie evidence of forgery and fabrication in others. The court has also ordered that proper procedures be followed in initiating proceedings and that violators be investigated in accordance with the law.
