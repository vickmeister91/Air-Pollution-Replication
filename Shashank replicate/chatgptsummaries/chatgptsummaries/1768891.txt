Pollution Control Board to investigate whether the operations were causing pollution and health hazards.

Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1966, but the department was not aware of whether any clearance had been sought from the A.P. Pollution Control Board before sanctioning the establishment of such units. The report also revealed that some illegal quarrying and crushing was going on in Khanapur village.

The court order pertains to the issue of quarrying and crushing operations near Osman Sagar lake, which supplies water to the City of Hyderabad.

The court emphasized the duty of the state to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife. It also noted that the right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation is not absolute and should yield to the interest of the general public. The court called for a balanced approach that takes into account the impact of pollution on the community, economic interests, and employment potential.
