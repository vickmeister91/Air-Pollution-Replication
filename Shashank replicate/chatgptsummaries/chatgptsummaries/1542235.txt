The court order in question concerns a dispute between the Official Receiver and two sons of Lebakula Subba Reddi, who were declared insolvent along with their brother. The second respondent had filed a suit against all five sons for the money owed by them on a promissory note, which resulted in the attachment and sale of certain immovable property belonging to the family. The Official Receiver and the two younger sons applied to the court to set aside the sale on the ground of material irregularity and fraud in the publication of the sale, and the Official Receiver also relied on the provisions of Order 21, Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Initially, the District Munsif dismissed the petition, but the District Judge allowed the appeal of the Official Receiver. However, the first respondent appealed to the court, and the appeal was allowed on the grounds that the Official Receiver was not the representative of the insolvent judgment-debtors, but of their creditors. The court held that the Official Receiver had the right to challenge the sale as the representative of the insolvent judgment-debtors, and the sale was set aside with regard to the interest of the three insolvent judgment-debtors in the property. The court also dismissed the memorandum of cross-objections filed by the first respondent.
