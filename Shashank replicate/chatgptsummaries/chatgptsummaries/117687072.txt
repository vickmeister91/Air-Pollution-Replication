The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Vishwanath Saket under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Saket was arrested on 12.09.2018 in connection with Crime No.328/2018 registered at Police Station-Bargava, District-Singrauli (M.P.) for the offence punishable under Sections 34 (2) of M.P. Excise Act. The prosecution alleged that Saket was found with around 60 bulk liters of country-made liquor made from Mahua, which was seized from him.

The court heard arguments from both parties and ultimately granted bail to Saket. However, this bail was granted on the condition that he furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 30,000/- and one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court for his appearance as and when directed.

The decision to grant bail to Saket was likely based on a number of factors. Firstly, it is important to note that bail is not a form of punishment, but rather a means of ensuring that the accused appears in court for their trial. As such, the court would have considered whether Saket was likely to flee or abscond if released on bail. It is possible that the court determined that Saket was not a flight risk, and therefore could be granted bail.

Additionally, the court may have considered the severity of the offence with which Saket was charged. While the prosecution alleged that Saket was found with a significant amount of illegal liquor, it is possible that the court did not view this as a particularly serious offence. This may have been due to the fact that the liquor was country-made and not of a particularly high quality, or because the court did not view the offence as being particularly harmful to society.

It is also possible that the court took into account Saket's personal circumstances when making its decision. For example, the court may have considered whether Saket had a history of criminal behaviour, or whether he had any ties to the community that would make it more likely that he would appear in court if released on bail.

Ultimately, the decision to grant bail to Saket was likely based on a combination of these factors. While the offence with which he was charged was certainly serious, it is possible that the court determined that he was not a flight risk and that he was likely to appear in court for his trial. As such, the court granted him bail on the condition that he provide a bail bond and surety to ensure his appearance in court.
