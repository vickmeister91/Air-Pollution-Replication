The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Alagesan and six others against the State by The Inspector of Police, Pathirivedu Police Station. The petitioners had filed an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to summon five documents from the respondent during the pendency of a murder trial. The Trial Court dismissed the petition, and the petitioners challenged the order of dismissal.

The petitioners had sought to summon five documents from the respondent, which included a copy of the First Information Report (FIR), the case diary, the statements of witnesses recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the medical report of the deceased, and the post-mortem report. The petitioners had argued that these documents were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial and for the defense of the accused.

The Trial Court, however, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners had not made out a case for summoning the documents. The Trial Court held that the documents sought by the petitioners were already in the possession of the prosecution and that the petitioners had not shown any reason why they could not obtain the documents from the prosecution.

The petitioners challenged the order of dismissal before the High Court. The High Court, after considering the submissions made by both parties, held that the petitioners had not made out a case for summoning the documents and that the Trial Court had rightly dismissed the petition. The High Court observed that the documents sought by the petitioners were already in the possession of the prosecution and that the petitioners had not shown any reason why they could not obtain the documents from the prosecution.

The High Court also observed that the petitioners had not shown how the documents sought by them were relevant to the defense of the accused. The High Court held that the mere fact that the documents were in the possession of the prosecution did not mean that the petitioners were entitled to summon them. The High Court held that the petitioners had not made out a case for summoning the documents and that the Trial Court had rightly dismissed the petition.

The petition was dismissed, and the connected Miscellaneous Petition was also dismissed. The court order, therefore, upholds the decision of the Trial Court and dismisses the petitioners' application for summoning the documents. The court order emphasizes the importance of making out a case for summoning documents and the need to show how the documents sought are relevant to the defense of the accused. The court order also highlights the fact that the mere possession of documents by the prosecution does not entitle the accused to summon them.
