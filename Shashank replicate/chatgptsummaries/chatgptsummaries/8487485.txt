The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Sri N Vijikumar seeking to quash an FIR registered against him by the Hennur Police Station in Bangalore. During the investigation, serious allegations were made against the investigation officer, Sri Lakshmikanth Prasad, for exceeding his limits while conducting the investigation. The court found that the officer had shown a partisan attitude towards the complainant and had exceeded his limits in supporting her case to the detriment of the accused.

The court ordered an enquiry against the officer and suspended him to ensure an impartial investigation. The officer challenged the suspension order, but the court upheld it, stating that he had exceeded his jurisdiction and inserted extraneous aspects into the notice to influence the petitioner's employer. The court noted that the officer had not provided a proper explanation for his conduct during the investigation.

The court order states that the third respondent exceeded his jurisdiction by inserting extraneous aspects into a notice to the employer of the petitioner, and that recalling or diluting the suspension order against him would be detrimental to the petitioner and society at large. The court concludes that there are no grounds to interfere with the order dated 30.06.2014 and dismisses the application.

The court's decision to suspend the investigation officer and order an enquiry against him is a significant step towards ensuring impartiality in the investigation.
