The High Court of Judicature at Madras passed an order on 13 August 2015 in a criminal case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for a direction to produce all records pertaining to loans allegedly given by PW1 to various persons between 2005 and 2014. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner was only protracting the trial further and that the documents called for were not relevant to the case.

The case in question was related to a cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had alleged that the cheque in question was issued towards repayment of a loan taken from him by the accused. The accused had denied the allegations and claimed that the cheque was issued towards payment of a debt owed to a third party. The trial court had framed charges against the accused and the case was pending trial.

The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for a direction to produce all records pertaining to loans allegedly given by PW1 to various persons between 2005 and 2014. The petitioner had claimed that the documents were relevant to the case as they would establish the nature of the relationship between the accused and PW1 and would also show that the accused had taken a loan from PW1. The prosecution had opposed the application on the grounds that the documents called for were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was only protracting the trial further.

The court, after hearing both sides, dismissed the petition. The court observed that the documents called for were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was only protracting the trial further. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents and that the documents, even if produced, would not advance the case of the petitioner. The court further observed that the petitioner had not shown how the documents called for were relevant to the case and that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the production of documents should be limited to those that are relevant to the case and that the production of irrelevant documents would only serve to protract the trial further. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents and that the documents, even if produced, would not advance the case of the petitioner.
