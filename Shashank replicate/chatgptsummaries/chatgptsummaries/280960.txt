In a writ petition filed by M/S. Chowgle and Company against the State of Karnataka, the petitioner sought to quash the First Information Report (FIR) and order of seizure filed against them for allegedly illegally mining iron ore in a forest area. The court considered several questions, including whether the Lokayukta report could be the basis for the FIR and order of seizure, whether the court had the power to quash the FIR, and whether the forest department had the authority to take action against the petitioner.

The court ultimately held that the Lokayukta report could be the basis for the FIR and order of seizure, and that the forest department had the authority to take action against the petitioner. However, the court also ordered that the seized articles would be returned to the petitioner if they gave an undertaking to hand over the possession of the impugned tools, vehicles, and machinery.

The court order dated 13.4.2009 addresses several issues related to an impugned FIR and order of seizure dated 3.2.2009. The court concludes that the Lokayukta report and satellite imagery can be used as a basis for initiating lawful action against illegal acts, but the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to be heard before any action was taken. The court also states that the power of judicial review should be exercised sparingly and not used to stifle a legitimate prosecution.

The court further discusses the Forest (Conservation) Act and the restrictions it imposes on the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court ultimately concludes that the second respondent was empowered to seize machinery, equipment, iron ore, and vehicles belonging to the petitioner for having committed illegal mining operations in the forest area.

The court order states that no authority can make any order directing the reserved forest to be ceased to be reserved, any forest land to be used for non-forest purposes, any forest land to be assigned to private individuals or organizations not owned by the state government, or any forest land to be cleared of naturally grown trees without prior approval from the Central Government. After the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came into force, no mining lease or license can be granted in the forest area without the prior approval of the Central Government.

The court also states that the mining lease granted to the petitioner in the forest area is subject to the conditions imposed by the Central Government and State Government while exercising the power conferred under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court orders the Deputy of Forests to inspect and survey the impugned area leased to the petitioner and take appropriate action if any encroachment of forest land is found.

The petitioner is directed to rectify the violation by removing any overburden waste within two weeks from the date of the order.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Chowgle and Company against the State of Karnataka regarding the quashing of an FIR and order of seizure for allegedly illegally mining iron ore in a forest area. The court considered several questions, including the use of the Lokayukta report as a basis for the FIR and order of seizure, the power of judicial review, and the authority of the forest department to take action against the petitioner.
