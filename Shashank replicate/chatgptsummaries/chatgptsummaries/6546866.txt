The case at hand involves a complaint filed by Vinod Jain under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, alleging that a cheque issued by the respondents to repay the money borrowed by him from the petitioner in personal relations amounting to Rs. 6,00,000/- was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds in the drawer's account. During the pendency of the complaint, the respondents filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for calling the income tax returns and bank statements along with the cash book, ledger, etc. from the petitioner.

The application was partly allowed to the extent that the petitioner was directed to produce his income tax return and bank statements. The application as far as it was related to the production of cash book and ledger, etc. of the business of petitioner was disallowed. The order of the learned trial Court was never challenged before any higher Court, therefore, the order attained finality.

During the cross-examination of the complainant/petitioner, it has come on record that the petitioner and the respondents were having business relation as buses of the respondents were attached to the transport company and luggage carrier company of the petitioner. Under the aegis of this admission, the respondents again filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. requesting the production of cash book and ledger, etc. relating to the business of the petitioner.

This second application was allowed vide order dated 10.08.2015. The learned trial Court was of the view that due to admission of the petitioner, the circumstances have been changed and in the changed circumstances, the second application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. is maintainable and allowed the application and directed the petitioner to produce cash book, ledger, etc. relating to his business.

The petitioner approached the revision Court, but his revision was dismissed as the order passed by the learned trial Court was interlocutory order and revision against interlocutory order was not maintainable. Therefore, the petitioner has approached this Court invoking its inherent power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

The Court held that the order passed by the learned trial Court dated 10.08.2015 is not sustainable, liable to be and is set aside hereby. The Court found that the admission made by the petitioner during cross-examination did not change the circumstances of the case to the extent that the second application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. could be allowed. The Court also noted that the order passed by the learned trial Court was interlocutory in nature and therefore not subject to revision.

In conclusion, the Court set aside the order passed by the learned trial Court dated 10.08.2015, which allowed the second application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the production of cash book and ledger, etc. relating to the business of the petitioner. The Court found that the admission made by the petitioner during cross-examination did not change the circumstances of the case to the extent that the second application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. could be allowed. The Court also noted that the order passed by the learned trial Court was interlocutory in nature and therefore not subject to revision.
