The Municipal Corporation of Bombay filed a suit against the defendants for two properties to recover unpaid property taxes. The defendants argued that the Municipality did not comply with the provisions of the Municipal Act for increased assessment. However, the court found that the Municipality had complied with the Act and that service on a person who collects rent on behalf of the family and is paid out of the family property or funds falls within the description of "servant of the family of the owner". The court also held that the special notice was properly served and that the increased assessment was valid.

The court order pertains to a case involving property assessment by the Municipality. The defendants claimed that they were not properly served notice of the assessment, but the court found that they were served in accordance with the law. The defendants also claimed that one of the properties had been demolished, but the court found that only a part of it had fallen down and there was no notice or objection to the assessment up to 1927. The defendants' claim for credit was also found to be unsustainable, and the plaintiffs were awarded a decree for Rs. 3,831-1-0. The defendants were ordered to pay the costs of the Municipality, and the counter-claim was dismissed with costs. In default of payment within six months, the premises would be sold, and the sale proceeds applied towards the payment of the amount.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Municipal Act for increased assessment. The court found that the Municipality had followed the proper procedures for assessment and that the defendants were properly served notice. The court also clarified that service on a person who collects rent on behalf of the family and is paid out of the family property or funds falls within the description of "servant of the family of the owner". This ruling provides clarity on who can be considered a "servant of the family of the owner" and can be served notice for property assessment.

The court also dismissed the defendants' claim for credit, which highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court. The defendants were unable to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim, and as a result, their claim was found to be unsustainable. This ruling emphasizes the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court.

Furthermore, the court's decision to award a decree for Rs. 3,831-1-0 to the plaintiffs and order the defendants to pay the costs of the Municipality highlights the consequences of not paying property taxes. The defendants were ordered to pay the outstanding amount and the costs of the Municipality. In default of payment within six months, the premises would be sold, and the sale proceeds applied towards the payment of the amount. This ruling emphasizes the importance of paying property taxes on time to avoid legal consequences.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Municipal Act for increased assessment and the consequences of not paying property taxes. The court's ruling provides clarity on who can be considered a "servant of the family of the owner" and can be served notice for property assessment.
