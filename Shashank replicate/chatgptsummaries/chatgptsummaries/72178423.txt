The case of Laxmiben Nathabhai Vaghela involves a petition seeking an order to provide electricity connection without demanding any further certificate from the respondent. The petitioner is an agriculturist who has a right, title, and interest in the land recognized under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The respondent No. 2, PGVCL, wrote a letter to the petitioner informing that the connection is yet not given as the Forest Department has denied providing an electric connection.

The respondent Nos. 3 and 4 are directed to forward such application to the Authority i.e. Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife, New Delhi, and Ministry of Forest and Environment, New Delhi, and said Authorities are directed to consider and decide the application in accordance with law preferably within six months from the receipt of the application forwarded by respondent Nos. 3 and 4.
