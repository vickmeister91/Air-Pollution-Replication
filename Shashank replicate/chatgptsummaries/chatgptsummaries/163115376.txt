The Bombay High Court recently heard a case brought by 23 units manufacturing sized yarn at Malegaon who claimed that their manufacturing activities had been closed down without any opportunity and their units had been sealed. The court found that the units had not been sealed by any of the respondents and directed the petitioners to remove the seal after due intimation to the Municipal Corporation and local police station. 

The court also directed respondent nos. 2 and 3 to complete the exercise of verification in accordance with law within the next three months. This means that the respondents must verify the claims made by the petitioners and ensure that they are in compliance with the law. The court has given them a deadline of three months to complete this exercise.

In addition, the petitioners were directed to pay additional court fees to the Registry of the court within the next two weeks. This is a standard practice in court cases, where the petitioner is required to pay a fee to the court for filing the case. The court has directed the petitioners to pay this fee within the next two weeks.

The court's decision is significant as it provides relief to the petitioners who had claimed that their manufacturing activities had been closed down without any opportunity and their units had been sealed. The court found that the units had not been sealed by any of the respondents, which means that the petitioners can now resume their manufacturing activities.

However, the court has also directed respondent nos. 2 and 3 to complete the exercise of verification in accordance with law within the next three months. This means that the respondents will have to verify the claims made by the petitioners and ensure that they are in compliance with the law. If the respondents find that the petitioners are not in compliance with the law, they may take action against them.

Overall, the court's decision provides relief to the petitioners and ensures that the respondents will have to verify the claims made by the petitioners and ensure that they are in compliance with the law. The court has also directed the petitioners to pay additional court fees to the Registry of the court within the next two weeks, which is a standard practice in court cases.
