In the first court order, the Commissioner of Income Tax filed an appeal against Motor Industries Co Ltd regarding the correctness of the assessment order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax for the assessment year 1989-90. The appeal concerned the deduction claimed by the assessee for remittances made to the community amounting to Rs. 2.9 crores, which the court examined to determine if it was allowable as a deductible expenditure. Additionally, the court considered whether the assessee was liable to pay tax on the amount of Rs. 16.92,29,532/- after taking into account the advance tax paid and the tax deducted at source.

After examining the case, the court allowed the appeal in part and set aside the orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Appellate Commissioner. The court found that the deduction claimed by the assessee for remittances made to the community was not allowable as a deductible expenditure. However, the court also found that the assessee was not liable to pay tax on the amount of Rs. 16.92,29,532/- after taking into account the advance tax paid and the tax deducted at source.

In the second court order, the case pertained to a tax liability dispute where the assessee was liable to pay taxes for several assessment years. The assessing officer had disallowed the deduction of interest, leading to a tax liability of Rs. 44.06.4/W. The assessee appealed to the Appellate Commissioner, who dismissed the appeal. The assessee then filed an appeal to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which partly allowed the appeal. The revenue appealed against the order, and the court observed that the assessing officer had allowed interest on the refund amount. The court also noted that the dispute was only regarding the disallowance of interest amounting to Rs. 25.41.234/-.

The court allowed the appeal in part and set aside the orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Appellate Commissioner.

In the third court order, the case pertained to a dispute over the allowance of interest amounting to INR 25,48,834/A, which had been previously allowed but was later disallowed under a rectification order. The court noted that there was no further dispute on this aspect, and the appellant was not pursuing this issue. The court also observed that there was a difference of opinion between the revenue and the appellant on the applicability of the proviso to clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 244A of the Act.

After examining the case, the court allowed the appeal in part and noted that the question posed in terms of the order of the Tribunal had not been answered contrary to the Appellate Authority's view.

In summary, these court orders pertain to tax liability disputes and appeals filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax against various companies. The court examined various aspects of the cases, including the correctness of assessment orders, the deductibility of certain expenditures, and the allowance of interest. In each case, the court allowed the appeal in part and set aside the orders passed by the lower authorities.
