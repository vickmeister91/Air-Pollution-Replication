The court ordered Santan to be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 30,000/- with one solvent surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned for his appearance on all dates as may be fixed by it in this regard.

The case against Santan and his co-accused persons was registered under the Forest Act, which prohibits the hunting, killing, or possession of any wild animal or its parts without a valid license. The possession of the meat and other parts of the Cheetal, a protected species under the Act, was a serious offense and could lead to imprisonment and hefty fines.

However, the court has granted bail to Santan, which means that he can be released from custody until the trial is completed. The bail was granted on the condition that Santan furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 30,000/- and one solvent surety of the same amount to ensure his appearance in court on all dates fixed by the court.

The granting of bail is not a judgment on the merits of the case but is based on the court's assessment of the likelihood of the accused person fleeing or tampering with evidence. In this case, the court has deemed it fit to grant bail to Santan, which means that he can be released from custody until the trial is completed.

It is important to note that the possession of wild animal parts is a serious offense and is punishable under the Forest Act. The Act is aimed at protecting the wildlife and their habitats and ensuring their conservation for future generations. The possession of such parts not only violates the law but also contributes to the illegal wildlife trade, which is a major threat to the survival of many species.
