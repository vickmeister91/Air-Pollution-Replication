The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to the maintainability of an appeal against an order passed under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The first order examines the legislative history and changes brought about by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976. The court refers the matter to a Full Bench to determine whether an appeal against any order passed under Section 47 of the Code after its amendment on any point whatsoever would still lie.

The second order discusses the amendment of the Civil Procedure Code in relation to execution proceedings. It notes that orders under Section 47 were previously treated as decrees by legal fiction, but the amendment removed this deeming provision and expressly abolished the right of appeal against such orders. The court concludes that no appeal is now maintainable against any order passed under Section 47.

The third order discusses the constitutionality of an amending provision that abolished the right of appeal against orders under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court held that the right of appeal is a creature of the statute and not a guaranteed or constitutional right. Therefore, the legislature can take away the right of appeal. The court also held that there is a reasonable classification in denying the right of appeal to parties to the suit and decrees while granting it to strangers to the decree. The court overruled the case of Parshava Properties Ltd. v. A.K. Bose, which held that the amending provision was unconstitutional.

The fourth order discusses the interpretation of Section 97 of an amending Act. The court determines that Clause (a) of Sub-section (2) of Section 97 saves both pending appeals and the right to file an appeal that had already accrued against an order passed under Section 47 of the Code before the amendment came into force.

The fifth order discusses the interpretation of Section 97(2)(a) of the Amending Act and its impact on the right to file an appeal against an order under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court concludes that no appeal is maintainable against such an order after the enforcement of the Amending Act. The court also discusses the applicability of Article 14 of the Constitution and overrules previous judgments.

The sixth order states that an order made under certain rules can be appealed as a decree. It also mentions specific rules that allow for appeals in the execution stage. The order pertains to a civil revision petition filed in an execution proceeding where the court below only decided on a preliminary point of law and not the objection raised under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The order sets aside the previous decision and directs the court below to decide both matters within three months.

In summary, these court orders all relate to the maintainability of an appeal against an order passed under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court examines the legislative history and changes brought about by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, and concludes that no appeal is now maintainable against any order passed under Section 47. The court also discusses the constitutionality of an amending provision that abolished the right of appeal against orders under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and overrules previous judgments. The court further explains that the right to file an appeal accrues only on the passing of the actual order under Section 47 of the Code and not earlier. The court also refers to various amended provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure.
