The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately allowed the petition, quashing all proceedings against the petitioners.

The petitioners had filed a criminal petition seeking to quash the FIR filed against them. They argued that the FIR was filed without any basis and that the allegations made against them were false. The State of Karnataka, on the other hand, argued that there was sufficient evidence to support the allegations made in the FIR.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court examined the evidence presented before it. The court noted that the allegations made in the FIR were not supported by any evidence. The court also observed that the jurisdictional Magistrate had not passed a speaking order, which was necessary in this case.

The court held that the endorsement made by the jurisdictional Magistrate was not a speaking order and did not provide any reasons for the decision taken. The court noted that a speaking order was necessary in this case as it would have provided clarity on the reasons for the decision taken.
