In a recent case, the court granted bail to eight applicants who were charged with receiving 3 kgs of beef of Chital, an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicants had not hunted any wildlife animal but had distributed the flesh among themselves. The court ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount for their appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial. The court also directed the applicants to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals and birds, and also prohibits the trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for penalties for offenses committed under it.

In this case, the applicants were charged with receiving 3 kgs of beef of Chital, which is a protected species under the Act. The applicants had not hunted any wildlife animal but had distributed the flesh among themselves. The court granted bail to the applicants, taking into consideration the fact that they had not hunted any wildlife animal and that they had distributed the flesh among themselves.

The court ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount for their appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial. This is a standard requirement for granting bail in criminal cases. The court also directed the applicants to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C., which requires the accused to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. The applicants had not hunted any wildlife animal and had only received the flesh of a protected species. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is also in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which provides for penalties for offenses committed under it.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the eight applicants who were charged with receiving 3 kgs of beef of Chital, an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a fair and just decision. The applicants had not hunted any wildlife animal and had only received the flesh of a protected species. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is also in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which provides for penalties for offenses committed under it. The court's order for the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount for their appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial, and to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C., is a standard requirement for granting bail in criminal cases.
