Arvind Singh, who has been accused of violating air pollution control laws and using illegally mined stones in his crusher, has been granted bail by the court. The petitioner had been in custody since April 8, 2018, and the court has ordered his release on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount.

The case against Arvind Singh has been ongoing for some time, with allegations that he has been violating air pollution control laws and using illegally mined stones in his crusher. These allegations have been taken seriously by the authorities, and Singh has been in custody since April 8, 2018.

However, the court has now granted him bail, which means that he will be released from custody upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount. This is a significant development in the case, as it means that Singh will be able to continue his defense outside of custody.

The decision to grant bail to Singh was likely based on a number of factors. Firstly, it is possible that the court felt that he was not a flight risk and that he would not attempt to evade justice if released on bail. Additionally, it is possible that the court felt that Singh's alleged offenses were not serious enough to warrant continued custody.

Whatever the reasons behind the decision, it is clear that Singh will now be able to continue his defense outside of custody. This will be a relief to him and his family, who have no doubt been under a great deal of stress and anxiety since his arrest.

It is worth noting, however, that Singh is still facing serious allegations, and the case against him is far from over. It is important that he continues to cooperate fully with the authorities and that he does everything in his power to clear his name.

Overall, the decision to grant bail to Arvind Singh is a significant development in this ongoing case. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the case will be, but for now, Singh will be able to continue his defense outside of custody.
