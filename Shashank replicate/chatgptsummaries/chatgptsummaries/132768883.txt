The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by different parties. The first petitioner seeks a mandamus to direct the respondent not to stop vehicles carrying building materials to their private layout. The second petitioner challenges a notice issued to them under Section 99 of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, regarding their possession of land in a wildlife sanctuary. The respondents have filed detailed objections, citing notifications and asserting their duty to protect the forest and wildlife. The court has heard both parties and reserved orders.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioners claim the right to use land near a Reserved Forest and Wild Life Sanctuary for commercial and residential purposes. The court examines the notification declaring the forest and sanctuary and concludes that the petitioners do not have an absolute right to use the land as they wish. The court also notes that the respondents have issued a notice and an enquiry is ongoing, and any decision taken by the respondents will be subject to judicial review. The court rejects the petitioner's argument that they have an unfettered right to use the land and cites the need to protect the flora and fauna in the sanctuary. The court also notes that disputed questions of fact cannot be decided in a writ petition and must be considered in the ongoing proceedings.

The court order states that the petitioner's claim for benefit cannot be extended as it is yet to be considered by the respondents. The court also mentions that the notice issued to the petitioner cannot be considered defective as it contains all the necessary details. The court further states that the respondents have the power to enter any land and survey it under Section 99 of the Act, 1963. The court also mentions that the petitioner's right to use the land and the respondent's right to protect the wildlife in the area are both important and need to be considered in the enquiry. The court dismisses the petitions with liberty to avail the appropriate remedy at the relevant stage.
