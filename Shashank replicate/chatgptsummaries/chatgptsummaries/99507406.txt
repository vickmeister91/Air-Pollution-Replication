The Gauhati High Court is currently hearing a case (I.A.(Civil) 970/2020) involving Rohiteswar Sahu and Manash Borgohain against the State of Assam and 24 others, including the Pollution Control Board and various individuals. The case is linked to another case (WP(C) 209/2020) involving Prema Raidengia and 17 others against the same defendants. The advocates for the petitioners and respondents are Mr. R Sensua and Mr. P P Dutta, respectively.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of Village No.2 Kachamari Gaon seeking action against the pollution caused by a hot mix plant operated by respondents No. 8 and 9. The petitioners allege that the plant is running without necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board and is causing pollution in a residential area. The court had earlier restrained respondents No. 8 and 9 from operating the plant based on the lack of necessary consent. The order lists the names and addresses of the petitioners and respondents and their legal representatives.

The court had previously restrained respondents No. 8 and 9 from operating a hot mix plant due to lack of consent to establish and operate. However, the respondents have now provided evidence of obtaining the necessary consents. The court vacated the interim order but stated that the respondents must apply for further consent to operate for the year 2020-2021. The court also noted that the objections raised by the writ petitioners must be considered by the PCB, Assam before granting further consent.

The court also set a deadline of 30 days for the PCB, Assam to make a decision on the application for consent to operate. The writ petitioners may also submit representations opposing the grant of consent. The court also noted that a blanket order extending consent to operate for all industries until 30.06.2020 is in place due to the COVID-19 situation. The writ petitioners may make an application opposing the operation of the hot mix plant until 30.06.2020, and the PCB, Assam must give a hearing to both parties before making a decision.

The court closed the case with the understanding that both parties will be given a hearing before any reasoned order is passed.
