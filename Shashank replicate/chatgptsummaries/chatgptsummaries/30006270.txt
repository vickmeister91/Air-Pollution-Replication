The court order pertains to a special appeal filed by Suneel Kumar Singh challenging the judgment and order of a learned single judge who had set aside his appointment as Head Master of Vidya Mandir Purva Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Kaamganj, Farrukhabad. The challenge was made by Arun Kumar Chaturvedi, who had participated in the selection process and alleged that Singh did not possess the essential qualification as prescribed under rule 4 of Rules of 1978 for appointment on the post of Head Master.

The court had to consider two questions: (A) whether Singh could be held to satisfy the requirement of 5 years teaching experience in a recognized school, and (B) whether Chaturvedi, who was also an applicant and a candidate in the selection process, could challenge the selection of Singh. The court held that Chaturvedi had the right to challenge the selection of Singh on the ground that he did not possess the prescribed minimum qualification, and that Singh did not possess the requisite qualification for appointment as a teacher in any recognized institution as per the prescribed rules.

The court order discusses the eligibility criteria for the appointment of a Head Master in a Junior High School. The rule requires a candidate to possess at least 5 years of teaching experience in a recognized institution. The court considers the distinction between de facto and de jure experience and concludes that only experience gained through a valid appointment in a recognized institution can be considered valid. The court also notes that the minimum qualification for appointment in a recognized institution is a trained teacher, and any appointment made without this qualification is void. Therefore, any experience gained through such an appointment cannot be considered valid.

The court held that Singh did not possess the requisite qualification for appointment as a teacher in any recognized institution as per the prescribed rules. The court also noted that Singh's appointment was made without the prescribed minimum qualification of a trained teacher, and therefore, his appointment was void. The court held that Chaturvedi had the right to challenge Singh's appointment on the ground that he did not possess the prescribed minimum qualification.

The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the learned Single Judge.
