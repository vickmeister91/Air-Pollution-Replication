The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Sava Healthcare Limited against the Karnataka Biodiversity Board. Sava Healthcare Limited had requested the quashing of a private complaint filed against them under the Biological Diversity Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately rejected Sava Healthcare Limited's request, stating that the company had not complied with Section 7 of the Act, which mandates prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board before obtaining any biological resource for commercial use. The court also noted that the manufacturing unit of Sava Healthcare Limited was located in Kolar district and therefore within the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate.

The court order states that any person seeking to obtain biological resources for commercial use or bio survey and utilization for commercial use must give prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board. The procedure for prior intimation is set out in Rule 15 of the Rules, 2005. The court also states that an officer cannot grant amnesty by issuing a notice and granting 15 days time to submit the form when the statute prohibits the utilization of biological resources without prior intimation to the Biodiversity Board. The court also mentions that contravention of Section 7 or any order made under Section 24(2) shall be punishable under Section 55(2) of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The court dismisses the petition and states that the grounds urged by the petitioners are not tenable.

The case at hand involves the interpretation and application of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, which seeks to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge for commercial purposes, and to ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. The Act establishes State Biodiversity Boards and National Biodiversity Authority to oversee the implementation of its provisions. Section 7 of the Act requires any person seeking to obtain any biological resource for commercial use to give prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board. Rule 15 of the Rules, 2005, sets out the procedure for prior intimation, which includes submission of an application form and payment of a fee.

In this case, Sava Healthcare Limited had obtained certain biological resources without prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board, and a private complaint had been filed against them under the Act. Sava Healthcare Limited had sought to quash the complaint on the grounds that they had not violated any provision of the Act, and that the complaint was filed with mala fide intent. The court, however, rejected these arguments and held that Sava Healthcare Limited had indeed violated Section 7 of the Act by not giving prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board. The court also noted that the manufacturing unit of Sava Healthcare Limited was located in Kolar district and therefore within the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate.

The court order also clarifies certain aspects of the Act and the Rules. The court states that an officer cannot grant amnesty by issuing a notice and granting 15 days time to submit the form when the statute prohibits the utilization of biological resources without prior intimation to the Biodiversity Board. This means that even if an officer becomes aware of a violation of Section 7, they cannot simply issue a notice and give the violator 15 days to submit the application form. The violator would still be liable for the violation, and could be punished under Section 55(2) of the Act.

The court order also emphasizes the importance of compliance with the Act and the Rules. The court notes that contravention of Section 7 or any order made under Section 24(2) shall be punishable under Section 55(2) of the Act. This means that any person who violates Section 7 or any order made under Section 24(2) could be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees, or with both.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Sava Healthcare Limited v. Karnataka Biodiversity Board clarifies certain aspects of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and emphasizes the importance of compliance with its provisions. The court held that Sava Healthcare Limited had violated Section 7 of the Act by not giving prior intimation to the State Biodiversity Board, and dismissed their petition seeking to quash the private complaint filed against them. The court also clarified that an officer cannot grant amnesty by issuing a notice and granting 15 days time to submit the form when the statute prohibits the utilization of biological resources without prior intimation to the Biodiversity Board. The court's order serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to comply with the Act and the Rules, and to ensure that the benefits arising from the use of biological resources are shared equitably.
