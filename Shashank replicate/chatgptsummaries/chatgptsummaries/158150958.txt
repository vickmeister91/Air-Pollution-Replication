The two court orders pertain to cases filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In the first case, the complainant alleged that the accused had issued a cheque for Rs. 2,00,000/- which was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The complainant had provided finance for a business venture with the accused, but did not receive any share of the profits. The accused claimed that the cheque was missing from the cheque book and that it was presented with an ulterior motive. The court allowed the accused to testify as a witness and re-examined him under Section 313 of CrPC. The matter was reserved for judgment after final arguments were made.

In the second case, the accused was alleged to have issued a cheque in partial discharge of his liability towards the complainant. The court found that the complainant had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the cheque was issued towards the discharge of an existing legally enforceable debt or other liability and was issued for a consideration. The court acquitted the accused of the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.

The section provides for criminal liability for the drawer of the cheque if the cheque is dishonored and the drawer fails to make the payment within 15 days of receiving a notice in writing from the payee demanding payment of the amount due.
