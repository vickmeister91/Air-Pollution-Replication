The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Surjeetsing Balveersing Shikh under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The applicant had been charged with an offence under Sections 65 (E), 81, 83, 98(2), 99, 116(B) of the Prohibition Act. The court has allowed the application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail on certain conditions.

The conditions of the bail include executing a personal bond of Rs.10,000/- and not leaving India without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned. The court has also directed that the trial court shall not be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the High Court in the present order.

The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain areas. The sections under which the applicant has been charged deal with various aspects of the Act, including the possession and transportation of alcohol.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is significant as it allows him to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody while they await trial. The granting of bail is subject to certain conditions, which are designed to ensure that the person does not flee the jurisdiction or interfere with the investigation.

In this case, the court has imposed conditions on the applicant's bail, including the requirement to execute a personal bond and not leave the country without prior permission. These conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant remains within the jurisdiction and does not interfere with the investigation or trial.

The court has also directed the trial court not to be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the High Court in the present order. This means that the trial court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and not be swayed by the observations made by the High Court in the bail order.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is a significant development in the case. It allows the applicant to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing, subject to certain conditions. The court's direction to the trial court not to be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the High Court is also an important reminder of the need for independent assessment of evidence in criminal cases.
