The State of Kerala filed a writ appeal against a previous judgment in a case involving the Forest Department's refusal to allow the Kerala State Electricity Board to draw an electric line through a forest area to provide electricity to a Scheduled Caste family residing there. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the previous judgment, quashing the Forest Department's order and directing the electricity connection to be provided before a certain date. The court also discussed relevant laws regarding forest conservation and the rights of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes.

The court order allows for the diversion of forest land for non-conventional sources of energy, skill upgradation or vocational training centres, roads, and community centres, as long as the land is less than one hectare and approved by the Grama Sabha. The court also ruled that drawing an electric line through an access road provided by the government does not require prior approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, as it is not an activity of non-forest purpose.

The court found that the 1st Respondent, a member of a Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste and a traditional forest dweller, is entitled to receive an electric connection under a scheme launched by the Central Government. The court relied on a Bombay High Court judgment to support its decision. The court order states that the Central Government cannot object to the scheme launched to provide electricity connections to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as it is the avowed objective of the scheme.

The court directed the K.S.E.B to provide electricity connection to the 1st respondent on or before 25.09.2015, and the appellants are directed to cooperate with the K.S.E.B. The appeal fails and is dismissed, subject to the above direction.
