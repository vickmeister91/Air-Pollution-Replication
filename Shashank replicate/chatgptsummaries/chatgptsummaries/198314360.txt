The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitions were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department.

The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court details the facts of the case and the demands made by the petitioners, ultimately reserving judgment on the matter. The court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas.

The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the compensation provisions do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the cluster of mining leases has been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and therefore the petitioner is liable to pay the compensation as part of the cluster. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area.

The court excluded the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed.

The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area. The court found that the mining lease holders refused to segregate cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares.

The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excluded the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV.
