Vincent T.C., the first accused in a case registered at the Santhanpara Police Station, had filed a bail application in relation to offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution had alleged that a Sambar Deer was trapped and killed on his plantation, and its meat was illegally retained. However, the court allowed the bail application, subject to certain conditions, as the prosecution had no case that the applicant hunted the wild animal.

The court order stated that the applicant was required to appear before the Investigating Officer within ten days and undergo interrogation. He shall be released on bail on executing a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like sum. The court had taken into consideration the fact that the applicant had no previous criminal record and that he had cooperated with the investigation.

The court had also noted that the prosecution had not been able to establish that the applicant had hunted the wild animal. The court had further observed that the applicant had not been found in possession of any weapons or traps that could have been used for hunting. The court had also taken into account the fact that the applicant had a plantation in the area and that it was possible that the wild animal had entered the plantation on its own.

The court had imposed certain conditions on the bail granted to the applicant. The applicant was directed to surrender his passport and not to leave the country without the permission of the court. He was also directed not to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses in the case. The court had further directed the applicant to report to the Investigating Officer as and when required and to cooperate with the investigation.

The court had also directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like sum. The sureties were required to be residents of the area and to furnish proof of their solvency. The court had also directed the applicant to attend all court hearings and not to abscond.

In conclusion, the court had granted bail to Vincent T.C. subject to certain conditions. The court had taken into consideration the fact that the prosecution had not been able to establish that the applicant had hunted the wild animal and that he had no previous criminal record. The court had also imposed certain conditions on the bail granted to the applicant to ensure that he cooperated with the investigation and did not tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses in the case.
