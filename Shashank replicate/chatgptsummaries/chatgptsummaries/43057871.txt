Sundaram had borrowed Rs. 4,00,000 from Thangadurai and issued a cheque in his favour, which was returned due to insufficient funds. Thangadurai filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and Sundaram filed a petition under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code for production of income tax returns.

The petition was rejected, and Sundaram filed another petition for the same documents, which was also rejected. The court held that Sundaram had exhausted his remedy under Section 91 and could not file another petition without any change of circumstances. The petition was dismissed, and the court found no irregularity or illegality in the order passed by the lower court.
