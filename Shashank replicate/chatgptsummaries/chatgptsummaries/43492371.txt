The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s Vicky Plastic for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. During a raid, the accused was found to be using and storing plastic bags, and the case property was seized. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable, but the DPCC argued that the complaint was filed by an authorized officer in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board. The court considered various judgments and ultimately found that the complaint was maintainable. The relevant extract of the Board Meeting dated 09.12.2009 / 30.12.2009 authorized the present complainant to file the complaint. The court also referred to relevant provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court order discusses sections 19 and 24 of the EP Act, which state that no court can take cognizance of an offense under the Act unless authorized by the Central Government or a person authorized by them. The order also cites previous court cases to interpret the meaning of "written consent" for prosecution under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the powers delegated to the Deputy Health Officer under the Municipal Corporation Act.

The court order discusses the delegation of powers under the Municipal Corporation Act and the issue of who has the authority to file a complaint under the Act. The court concludes that only the authorities mentioned in the Act can launch proceedings against persons charged with offenses under the Act or the rules, regulations, or bye-laws made under it. The court also notes that an officer of the municipality must perform their duties created by statute or bye-law and cannot delegate them to others unless expressly authorized. The court rejects the argument that technicalities pertaining to non-filing of a complaint by an authorized person can be cured at any stage of litigation.

The court order states that if there is a special provision for taking cognizance of an offense under a statute, the complainant must satisfy the eligibility criteria prescribed by the statute. In this case, the present complaint was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act, and the DPCC exceeded its power by sub-delegating their power to file a complaint to the area AEE. The complainant is duty-bound to remove the technical objection of competency to maintain the complaint. The court held that the present complaint is not maintainable, and therefore, no charge can be framed, and the accused stands discharged.
