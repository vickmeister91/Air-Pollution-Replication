The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by V.S. Raju and V.S. Murugan regarding their claim for assignment of 57.4620 hectares of revenue puramboke in Chinnakanal village. The petitioners claim that their father was in possession of the land and had submitted applications for assignment, which are pending consideration. The court notes that a previous writ petition on the same matter was disposed of with a judgment directing the state government to look into the representation submitted and take appropriate action. The government found that the land in question is in the possession and control of the Forest Department and contains eucalyptus trees planted by them. The court declines to quash the government's order and notes that the question before the government was only whether the Forest Department was justified in interfering with the petitioner's alleged possession of the land.

The court order states that the findings in Ext.P17 are not incorrect and the decision to interfere with the petitioner's possession of the land was justified. The court directs the 3rd respondent to consider and dispose of Exts.P3 to P13 applications for land assignment based on the eligibility of each applicant. The decision should be taken within three months and no further steps for dispossession should be taken until a decision is made.
