The two court orders pertain to cases of dishonor of cheques under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. In the first case, the complainant had invested money in M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. run by the accused, and upon maturity, asked for the chit amount to be returned. The accused issued cheques that were dishonored for the reason of account closure. The accused contended that the complaint was not maintainable as M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. had not been impleaded as an accused. The court observed that the directors of the company cannot be prosecuted for the commission of the offense of dishonor of a cheque unless the company is also proceeded against. The court dismissed the application filed by the complainant seeking the leave of the court to implead M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. as an accused. The accused were acquitted and held not guilty.

In the second case, an amendment was sought to add another entity as an accused. The court ruled that the amendment was not of a formal nature and could not be allowed. The non-impleadment of the entity was a defect that went to the root of the complaint and could not be cured through Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code. As a result, the complaint was not maintainable, and the accused were acquitted of the commission of the offense under Section 138 of the NI Act.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act deals with the dishonor of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonored due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable and punished with imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or with a fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.

In the first case, the complainant had invested money in M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. run by the accused. Upon maturity, the complainant asked for the chit amount to be returned. The accused issued cheques that were dishonored for the reason of account closure. The complainant filed a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act against the accused.

The accused contended that the complaint was not maintainable as M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. had not been impleaded as an accused. The court observed that the directors of the company cannot be prosecuted for the commission of the offense of dishonor of a cheque unless the company is also proceeded against. The court dismissed the application filed by the complainant seeking the leave of the court to implead M/s. Sukhdata Chits Pvt. Ltd. as an accused. The accused were acquitted and held not guilty.

The court's decision in this case is based on the principle of corporate liability. The directors of a company cannot be held liable for the commission of an offense unless the company is also proceeded against. This principle is based on the fact that a company is a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders. Therefore, the liability of the company cannot be attributed to its directors or shareholders.

In the second case, an amendment was sought to add another entity as an accused. The court ruled that the amendment was not of a formal nature and could not be allowed. The non-impleadment of the entity was a defect that went to the root of the complaint and could not be cured through Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code. As a result, the complaint was not maintainable, and the accused were acquitted of the commission of the offense under Section 138 of the NI Act.

The court's decision in this case is based on the principle of procedural law. The non-impleadment of an accused is a defect that goes to the root of the complaint. This defect cannot be cured through Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with the power of the court to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of the offense. Therefore, the complaint was not maintainable, and the accused were acquitted.

In conclusion, the two court orders discussed above highlight the importance of impleading the correct parties in a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act. The first case emphasizes the principle of corporate liability, while the second case emphasizes the principle of procedural law. It is essential to follow these principles to ensure that justice is served and that the guilty are punished.
