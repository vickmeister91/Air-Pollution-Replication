The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Janab Abdulrahiman against Althafhussein and others. The petitioner had sought to quash an order passed by the JMFC-I Court, Hubballi, which had rejected his application seeking the production of an irrevocable general power of attorney executed by him and others in favor of accused No.2. The petitioner had also sought permission to adduce a Xerox copy of the document as secondary evidence.

The court, however, rejected the petition, stating that the application seeking production of the document from the custody of the accused person was not maintainable, and the order passed by the JMFC Court was in accordance with the law.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the ownership of a property, and the irrevocable general power of attorney in question is a crucial document in determining the rightful owner. The petitioner had argued that the document was in the possession of the accused person, and therefore, he should be compelled to produce it in court.

However, the court held that the petitioner's application seeking production of the document from the custody of the accused person was not maintainable. The court cited Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that a court may issue a summons or warrant for the production of a document only if it is in the possession or power of the person against whom it is sought.

In this case, the court noted that the document in question was not in the possession or power of the accused person, but rather, it was in the possession of the petitioner himself. Therefore, the court held that the petitioner's application seeking production of the document from the accused person was not maintainable.

The court also rejected the petitioner's request to adduce a Xerox copy of the document as secondary evidence. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to establish that the original document was in the possession or power of the accused person, and therefore, the petitioner could not rely on secondary evidence to prove the contents of the document.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when seeking the production of documents in court. It also underscores the need for parties to establish the possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought before seeking its production.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the law must be followed in all legal proceedings, and that parties must be diligent in establishing the facts of their case before seeking relief from the court.
