The court order pertains to the import of raw pet coke (RPC) by various companies and the restrictions imposed on its import by the Supreme Court. The court had directed that the overall limit for import of RPC be 1.4 million MT per annum and that the limit for the period between October 2018 and March 2019 be 0.7 million MT. The petitioners had imported 0.664 million MT of RPC prior to August 2018 and sought clarification on whether this would be adjusted against the allocation for the latter half of the financial year. The court ruled that the RPC already imported prior to September 2018 shall not be considered against the allocation for the period October 2018 to March 2019.

The court order provides details of a petition filed by Rain CII Carbon (Vizag) Ltd. and another party, challenging the Minutes of the Meeting held on 12.12.2018 between officials of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and the Indian Oil Corporation. The petitioners also challenge a letter dated 01.02.2019 sent by the DGFT informing the petitioner that it was decided to adjust the eleven consignments of Raw Pet Coke cleared by the customs against the quota allotted to the petitioner no. 1 for the period between October 2018 and March 2019.

The court order provides details of the relevant extract of the decision passed in certain applications filed in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India: W.P.(C)13029/1985, which accepted that RPC could be used as a feedstock for producing CPC, but clarified that imported RPC for this purpose cannot exceed 1.4 Million Metric Tonnes (MT). The order also provides details of the impugned minutes and the allocation of Raw Pet Coke for CPC manufacturing.
