The case in question is a criminal revision case filed by Digvijay Singh against an order summoning him for an offense punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The case was filed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau against seven accused persons, including Singh, for violating the provisions of the Act. Singh's counsel argued that there was no evidence against him and that the Trial Court had acted mechanically in summoning him. The respondent argued that Singh, as the General Manager of the hotel, was responsible for the conduct of business and thus liable for the violations committed by the other accused persons. The Trial Court had dispensed with the requirement of pre-summoning evidence and had taken cognizance of the offense and summoned the accused persons.

The court order takes cognizance of an offense under the Wildlife Protection Act and summons the accused persons. The court cites a previous case stating that summoning an accused is a serious matter and the magistrate must carefully examine the evidence before summoning. The court then examines the case against the petitioner, who is accused of being in charge of a hotel where an offense was committed. The court notes that the complainant must show prima facie evidence that the offense was committed by the company and the accused was in charge of the business. However, the complainant did not disclose the identity of the company and only prosecuted the hotel. The court questions the status of the petitioner in the company and cites a previous case stating that the complainant must state how the accused was in charge of the business.

The court order states that it is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint that the accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. The petitioner cannot be held liable with the aid of Section 58 of the Act unless there is some material on record to show that accused no.1 was a company as defined under Section 58 of the Act. The summoning order was passed in a mechanical manner without considering the status of accused no.1 and whether there are sufficient averments in the complaint that the petitioner was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company. The court sets aside the impugned order and allows the criminal revision petition.

In summary, the case involves a criminal revision petition filed by Digvijay Singh against an order summoning him for an offense punishable under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
