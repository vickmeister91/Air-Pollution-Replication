The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd had filed an appeal against an order-in-original passed by the Adjudicating Authority, which had rejected the CENVAT credit of Service tax paid. The issue at hand was whether the CENVAT credit of services of Para medical staff availed by the appellant for providing medical facilities to its employees in the factory is admissible or not, when such services are required to be provided statutorily under the Factories Act, 1948.

The appellant had argued that the services of Para medical staff were availed for providing medical facilities to its employees in the factory, which is a statutory requirement under the Factories Act, 1948. Therefore, the CENVAT credit of such services should be admissible. However, the Adjudicating Authority had rejected this argument and held that the CENVAT credit of such services is not admissible.

The appellant had contended that the Adjudicating Authority had erred in rejecting the CENVAT credit of services of Para medical staff availed by the appellant for providing medical facilities to its employees in the factory. The appellant had argued that the services of Para medical staff were availed for providing medical facilities to its employees in the factory, which is a statutory requirement under the Factories Act, 1948. Therefore, the CENVAT credit of such services should be admissible.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, allowed the appeal filed by the appellant. The court held that the CENVAT credit with respect to medical facilities provided statutorily under the Factories Act 1948 will be admissible. The court observed that the services of Para medical staff were availed for providing medical facilities to the employees in the factory, which is a statutory requirement under the Factories Act, 1948. Therefore, the CENVAT credit of such services should be admissible.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the admissibility of CENVAT credit with respect to medical facilities provided statutorily under the Factories Act, 1948. The decision will benefit companies that provide medical facilities to their employees in the factory and avail the services of Para medical staff for the same.
