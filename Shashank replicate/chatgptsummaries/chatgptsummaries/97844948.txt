The Gujarat High Court recently passed a significant order in a criminal case where the accused had filed an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking to quash and set aside the FIR registered against him for various offences. The court directed that the charge-sheet filed in connection with the FIR should be treated as a supplementary charge-sheet and there shall be one common trial for all the offences. The proceedings of the previous criminal case would not survive, and the charge shall be framed accordingly.

The case pertains to a criminal complaint filed against the accused for offences under Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The accused had challenged the FIR on the grounds that the allegations made against him were false and baseless. He had also contended that the FIR was filed with malafide intentions to harass him.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the allegations made against the accused were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the charge-sheet filed in connection with the FIR had mentioned several offences, and therefore, it was necessary to have a common trial for all the offences.

The court further directed that the proceedings of the previous criminal case would not survive, and the charge shall be framed accordingly. This means that the accused would not be tried separately for the offences mentioned in the previous criminal case. Instead, all the offences would be tried together in one common trial.

The court also observed that the charge-sheet filed in connection with the FIR should be treated as a supplementary charge-sheet. This means that the charge-sheet filed earlier in the previous criminal case would be treated as the main charge-sheet, and the charge-sheet filed in connection with the FIR would be treated as a supplementary charge-sheet.

The court's order is significant as it ensures that the accused is not harassed by multiple trials for the same offences. It also ensures that all the offences are tried together in one common trial, which would save time and resources. The court's order also ensures that the investigation into the allegations made against the accused is thorough and fair.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's order in this criminal case is a significant step towards ensuring that justice is served in a fair and efficient manner. The court's decision to have one common trial for all the offences and to treat the charge-sheet filed in connection with the FIR as a supplementary charge-sheet is a welcome move. It ensures that the accused is not harassed by multiple trials and that the investigation into the allegations made against him is thorough and fair.
