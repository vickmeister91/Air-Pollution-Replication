The court order in question relates to a revision filed by Darshan Singh Grewal against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana. The order allowed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) moved by accused Gurbachan Singh for summoning the inquiry file. The petitioner, Grewal, sought to challenge this order on the grounds that it was passed without proper application of mind and was therefore illegal and unjust.

However, upon examination of the facts and circumstances of the case, the court found no grounds for interference and dismissed the petition. The court noted that the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge was well-reasoned and based on sound legal principles. The court also observed that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate any material irregularity or illegality in the order that would warrant interference by the court.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Cr.P.C and the principles of law governing the summoning of inquiry files. The court noted that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C empowers a court to summon and examine any document or material that it deems necessary or relevant to the proceedings before it. However, the court also observed that this power must be exercised judiciously and in accordance with the principles of natural justice.

In the present case, the court found that the Additional Sessions Judge had exercised his discretion in a reasonable and fair manner. The court noted that the accused had made a prima facie case for summoning the inquiry file, and that the Additional Sessions Judge had considered all relevant factors before passing the order. The court also observed that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate any prejudice or harm that would result from the summoning of the inquiry file.

The court's decision in this case underscores the importance of judicial discretion and the need for courts to exercise their powers in a fair and reasonable manner. The court's analysis of the relevant legal provisions and principles of law provides valuable guidance for future cases involving the summoning of inquiry files. Overall, the court's decision in this case represents a sound and well-reasoned application of the law to the facts before it.
