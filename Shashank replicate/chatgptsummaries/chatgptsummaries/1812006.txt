The Madras High Court recently heard multiple writ petitions challenging government orders related to the location of industries and the issuance of consent for industries in Tamil Nadu. The petitions were filed by various companies and industry associations, and the court heard arguments from both petitioners and respondents. The court ultimately issued a common order, which included directions to quash certain government orders and consider applications for consent without reference to those orders.

One of the court orders pertains to multiple writ petitions challenging the validity of G.O.Ms.No.213 and G.O.Ms.No.127, which prohibit the establishment of highly polluting industries within 1 km and 5 km respectively from water sources. The petitioners include tanneries, electroplating units, and a tapioca products manufacturer. The court heard arguments from both sides and concluded that the issue at hand is whether the aforementioned government orders are valid in law. The court also provided the text of G.O.Ms.No.213 and G.O.Ms.No.127 for reference.

The court order enforces a government policy that highly polluting industries should not be established within 1 km distance from certain water resources. The order also directs the authorities to review already established industries and relocate them if necessary. The order further amends the policy to prohibit highly water polluting industries from being established within 5 km distance from important water resources. The order cites the need to protect water quality, public health, and living beings. The court dismisses writ petitions challenging the validity of the government order.

The Madras High Court's decision is a significant one, as it addresses the issue of industrial pollution and its impact on the environment and public health. The court's order is in line with the government's efforts to promote sustainable development and protect natural resources. The court's decision to quash certain government orders and consider applications for consent without reference to those orders is a positive step towards ensuring that industries operate in an environmentally responsible manner.

The court's decision to uphold the validity of G.O.Ms.No.213 and G.O.Ms.No.127 is also important, as it reinforces the government's commitment to protecting water resources from pollution. The court's order to review already established industries and relocate them if necessary is a welcome move, as it will help to reduce the impact of industrial pollution on the environment and public health.

Overall, the Madras High Court's decision is a positive one, as it promotes sustainable development and protects natural resources. The court's order to quash certain government orders and consider applications for consent without reference to those orders is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that industries operate in an environmentally responsible manner. The court's decision to uphold the validity of G.O.Ms.No.213 and G.O.Ms.No.127 and review already established industries is also a welcome move towards reducing the impact of industrial pollution on the environment and public health.
