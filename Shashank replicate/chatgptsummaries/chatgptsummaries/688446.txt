The case in question pertains to the killing of a Sambar deer and sharing its meat, which is a violation of various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Sivadasan K.N. is the fourth accused in the case and had filed a bail application before the court. The court, after considering the nature of the offense, the duration of judicial custody, and other circumstances, granted bail to the petitioner.

However, the bail was granted on certain conditions. The petitioner was required to execute a bond for Rs. 10,000 and provide two solvent sureties.

The court warned that if the petitioner breached any of these conditions, the bail granted to him would be liable to be canceled. This is a standard warning given by courts while granting bail to ensure that the accused does not misuse the liberty granted to him.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on several factors. The nature of the offense was one of the factors considered. The killing of a Sambar deer and sharing its meat is a serious offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. However, the court also considered the duration of judicial custody, which suggests that the petitioner had already spent a considerable amount of time in custody.

Other circumstances were also taken into account while granting bail. These circumstances could include the petitioner's age, health, and family background. The court may have also considered the strength of the evidence against the petitioner and the likelihood of him absconding or tampering with evidence.

The conditions imposed by the court are standard conditions that are imposed while granting bail. The petitioner is required to report before the Investigating Officer every Wednesday to ensure that he does not abscond. He is also required to make himself available for interrogation to assist the investigation. The condition that he not influence or intimidate prosecution witnesses is to ensure that the investigation is not hampered in any way.

The condition that he not commit any offense while on bail is to ensure that he does not engage in any criminal activity while he is out on bail. This condition is imposed to protect society from any potential harm that the petitioner may cause.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sivadasan K.N., the fourth accused in a case related to the killing of a Sambar deer and sharing its meat, under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.
