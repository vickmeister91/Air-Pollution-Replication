The Orissa High Court recently received multiple applications under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India from various petitioners, including Kalia Sethi, Prabin Kumar Gupta, and Bikram Kishore Sahoo, among others, against the State of Odisha and others. The court order lists the case numbers and the names of the petitioners and their respective counsels. This court order pertains to a batch of writ petitions challenging the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and the machinery to control pollution under the Environment Act. The petitioners are license holders of out still liquor shops and are carrying on their business as per the license granted by the State Authorities under the State Excise Laws. The Collector of the concerned district has issued an order directing closure of the out still liquor shops pursuant to the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, Eastern Zone, Kolkata in O.A. No.19/2017/EZ holding that no liquor manufacture units, be it country or otherwise, shall be permitted to operate without environment clearance. The court has heard both sets of writ petitions and disposed of them by this common order.

The court order discusses a dispute regarding the closure of out still shops due to environmental violations. The State Pollution Control Board argues that the writ petitions are not maintainable before the court and that the National Green Tribunal has jurisdiction over the matter. The Board also argues that the closure of the shops is necessary to protect the environment and that the Board has the authority to regulate and monitor environmental laws. The court discusses various environmental laws and regulations and ultimately decides to hear the case.

The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing ecological destruction. The court has observed that the government has the power to take measures to protect and improve the environment and prevent pollution. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 has been promulgated to ensure effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation. The court has examined the jurisdiction of High Courts sitting under Article 226 and has referred to the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution. The court has held that the power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the high courts under Article 226 and in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the constitution is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. The court has also held that the exclusion of jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 226 / 227 and 32 of the Constitution is unconstitutional.

The court has declared that clauses 2(d) of Article 323-A and 3(d) of Article 323-B, which exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional. The court has also held that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 does not exclude the power of the High Courts under Articles 226/227, and therefore, the writ petition is maintainable. The court has discussed the various notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the State Pollution Control Board and has concluded that the objection raised by the petitioners regarding the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal is not acceptable.

The court order requires distilleries in Odisha to obtain environmental clearance and valid consent to operate under the law. The State Pollution Control Board is directed to take necessary action against distilleries operating without valid clearance and consent. The court rejects the argument that country liquor still shops are not distilleries and must obtain consent to operate. The Pollution Control Board has found evidence of pollution in the distilleries and the matter has been left to the Board to assess whether the units come under the consent zone or not. The court grants the petitioners the liberty to approach the competent authority of the Pollution Control Board or the Central Board to seek consent to operate within 7 days. The competent authority is directed to conclude the process of granting consent to operate.

The court order directs the competent authority to grant consent to operate and issue environmental clearance within three weeks of receiving applications that must be completed within seven days. The interim orders granted in previous writ petitions will continue for four weeks if the occupiers of the units make their applications within the stipulated period. Failure to do so will result in closure of the units. The final outcome of the decision of the Board will determine the continuation of operation of the units. The order passed by the National Green Tribunal is modified accordingly.

In summary, the Orissa High Court received multiple applications challenging the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and the machinery to control pollution under the Environment Act. The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing ecological destruction. The court has declared that clauses 2(d) of Article 323-A and 3(d) of Article 323-B, which exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional. The court order requires distilleries in Odisha to obtain environmental clearance and valid consent to operate under the law. The court directs the competent authority to grant consent to operate and issue environmental clearance within three weeks of receiving applications that must be completed within seven days. The final outcome of the decision of the Board will determine the continuation of operation of the units.
