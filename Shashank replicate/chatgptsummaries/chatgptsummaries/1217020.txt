The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently delivered a ruling on a case involving the closure of a factory for two months due to pollution concerns. The court held that the Additional District Magistrate did not have the authority to pass an order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to close the factory. The court noted that there are three statutes dealing with preventing pollution and ill-effects caused by industrial effluents, and that the specific provisions of these statutes should override general provisions.

The case involved a distillery that was ordered to be closed for two months by the Additional District Magistrate due to pollution concerns. The distillery challenged the order in court, arguing that the Additional District Magistrate did not have the authority to pass such an order. The court agreed with the distillery and held that the Additional District Magistrate did not have the power to pass an order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to close the factory.

The court noted that there are three statutes dealing with preventing pollution and ill-effects caused by industrial effluents, namely the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court held that the specific provisions of these statutes should override general provisions, and that the Pollution Board or Pardushan Nirwana Mandal should step in and perform their duty to suggest remedial measures and inspect the factory.

The court also appointed a commission to ensure compliance with the undertaking given by the petitioner distillery. The commission was tasked with monitoring the distillery's compliance with the remedial measures suggested by the Pollution Board or Pardushan Nirwana Mandal, and ensuring that the distillery did not cause any further pollution.

The ruling is significant as it clarifies the authority of the Additional District Magistrate to pass orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in cases involving pollution concerns. The ruling also highlights the importance of the three statutes dealing with preventing pollution and ill-effects caused by industrial effluents, and the need for the Pollution Board or Pardushan Nirwana Mandal to perform their duty to suggest remedial measures and inspect factories.

Overall, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's ruling in this case provides important guidance on the legal framework for dealing with pollution concerns in the state. The ruling emphasizes the need for a coordinated approach involving the Pollution Board or Pardushan Nirwana Mandal, the courts, and other stakeholders to address pollution concerns and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
