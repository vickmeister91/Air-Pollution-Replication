In the first case, P. Shanmugam filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the second respondent to execute a lease deed in his favor and permit him to carry on quarrying operations in his Patta lands. The lands consist of Quartz and Feldspar, and the petitioner had made an application seeking permission to quarry for a period of 20 years on payment of necessary charges. The first respondent had granted the mining lease, subject to certain conditions, and directed the second respondent to execute the lease deed. However, the lease deed was not executed within the stipulated period of six months, and the petitioner filed the writ petition seeking relief. The second respondent filed a counter affidavit stating that the delay in executing the lease deed was due to the petitioner's delay in submitting the financial assurance. The court ordered the second respondent to execute the lease deed within four weeks.

In the second case, the petitioner sought permission to quarry for 20 years on a land consisting of Quartz and Feldspar. The Geology Department forwarded the application to the District Collector for inspection and technical report. The District Collector had not executed the release deed in favor of the petitioner for operating the quarry. The first respondent had granted a lease for quarrying mines in his patta lands at Koothanatham Village for a period of 20 years and imposed some special conditions. The petitioner had not complied with the condition of making payment of Rs.1,00,000/- within a period of six months. The court gives liberty to the petitioner to submit a fresh representation to the respondents concerned regarding late payment.
