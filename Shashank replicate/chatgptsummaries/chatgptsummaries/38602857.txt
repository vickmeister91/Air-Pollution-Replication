Sagarkumar Dhansukhbhai Solanki was granted regular bail by the court in connection with a FIR registered at Kadodara GIDC Police Station, District Surat, for offences punishable under Sections 65 (E) and 81 of the Prohibition Act. The court ordered Solanki to execute a bond of Rs.10,000/- with one surety of the like amount and follow certain conditions. These conditions included surrendering his passport and marking his presence at the concerned Police Station on every Monday of each English Calendar month for a period of six months and thereafter any day of the first week of every English calendar month for a period of two years. The court also directed the trial court not to be influenced by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail.

The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in India. Section 65 (E) of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of any rule made under the Act. Section 81 of the Act deals with the punishment for the commission of any offence under the Act for which no specific punishment is provided.

Solanki was accused of violating these sections of the Prohibition Act, and a FIR was registered against him at Kadodara GIDC Police Station in Surat. The court granted him regular bail, which means that he can be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. However, he must follow certain conditions set by the court to ensure that he does not flee or tamper with evidence.

One of the conditions set by the court was that Solanki must execute a bond of Rs.10,000/- with one surety of the like amount. This means that he must pay Rs.10,000/- to the court as a guarantee that he will appear for trial and follow the conditions set by the court. He must also provide a surety, which is a person who agrees to pay the amount of the bond if Solanki fails to appear for trial or violates the conditions set by the court.

Another condition set by the court was that Solanki must surrender his passport. This is to ensure that he does not flee the country while the trial is ongoing. He must also mark his presence at the concerned Police Station on every Monday of each English Calendar month for a period of six months and thereafter any day of the first week of every English calendar month for a period of two years. This is to ensure that he remains in the jurisdiction of the court and does not abscond.

The court also directed the trial court not to be influenced by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail. This means that the trial court must make its own independent decision based on the evidence presented before it and not be swayed by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail.

In conclusion, Sagarkumar Dhansukhbhai Solanki was granted regular bail by the court in connection with a FIR registered at Kadodara GIDC Police Station, District Surat, for offences punishable under Sections 65 (E) and 81 of the Prohibition Act. He must follow certain conditions set by the court, including surrendering his passport and marking his presence at the concerned Police Station on every Monday of each English Calendar month for a period of six months and thereafter any day of the first week of every English calendar month for a period of two years. The trial court must make its own independent decision based on the evidence presented before it and not be swayed by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail.
