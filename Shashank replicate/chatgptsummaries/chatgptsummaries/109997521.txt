In a recent court order, Mohd. Hasin was acquitted of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, after being found in possession of a tiger skin without a license or legal source of procurement. The prosecution had alleged that he violated several sections of the Act, but the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The court heard arguments and evidence from both sides, including witnesses and documents, and ultimately found the accused not guilty.

The court order pertains to a case of contravention of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, where the accused was charged with possessing tiger skin. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove the recovery of the case property from the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and there were material contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses. The court acquitted the accused of the charges and extended the bail bonds for six months. The case property, if any, was confiscated to the state, and the judgment was sent to the court's server.

The court order was announced by ACMM (Special Acts) Central, Devendra Kumar Sharma, at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi on March 21, 2013. The order is nine pages long and pertains to a case between WLI and Mohd. Hasin.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife in India. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, as well as the trade in any part or product derived from a wild animal. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In cases of violation of the Act, it is important for the prosecution to provide strong evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. This can include physical evidence, such as the recovery of the case property from the accused, as well as witness testimony and other documentary evidence.

The case of Mohd. Hasin also highlights the importance of due process in the legal system. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, and the court heard arguments and evidence from both sides before making a decision. This is an important aspect of the legal system, as it ensures that justice is served and that the rights of the accused are protected.

In conclusion, the court order acquitting Mohd. Hasin of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, highlights the importance of evidence and due process in the legal system. The prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the tiger skin, and the court had no choice but to acquit the accused of the charges. This case serves as a reminder of the need for strong evidence and due process in all legal proceedings, particularly those involving the protection of wildlife and the environment.
