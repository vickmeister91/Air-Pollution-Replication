The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had issued a notice to M/S Bagalkot Cement & Industries for violating pollution control laws. The Board had refused to validate the industry's consent to operate under the Water and Air Acts, and the matter was taken to the Appellate Authority. The Authority set aside the Board's order and remitted the matter back to the Board for reconsideration. The Central Pollution Control Board also issued directions to the industry to stop operations until it met emission standards. The Board issued directions to the industry in accordance with the CPCB's directions, but the industry challenged the order in court. The court found that the Board was bound by the CPCB's directions and remitted the matter back to the Board for fresh orders.

In another case, the court order states that the material on record shows that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued a direction to the writ petitioner under Section 20-A of the Air Act, which requires the person or authority to whom the direction is sought to be given an opportunity to object to it. The petitioner issued directions to the respondent without providing such an opportunity, and there is no order dispensing with this requirement. Therefore, the court orders that the procedure under Rule 20-A of the Rules must be followed.

The above two cases are related to the violation of pollution control laws by industries in Karnataka. The first case involves M/S Bagalkot Cement & Industries, which was issued a notice by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board for violating pollution control laws. The Board had refused to validate the industry's consent to operate under the Water and Air Acts, and the matter was taken to the Appellate Authority. The Authority set aside the Board's order and remitted the matter back to the Board for reconsideration. The Central Pollution Control Board also issued directions to the industry to stop operations until it met emission standards. The Board issued directions to the industry in accordance with the CPCB's directions, but the industry challenged the order in court. The court found that the Board was bound by the CPCB's directions and remitted the matter back to the Board for fresh orders.

The second case involves a writ petition filed by an industry challenging the directions issued by the Central Pollution Control Board under Section 20-A of the Air Act. The court found that the petitioner had issued directions to the respondent without providing an opportunity to object to it, as required under Rule 20-A of the Rules. Therefore, the court ordered that the procedure under Rule 20-A of the Rules must be followed.

These cases highlight the importance of following the procedures laid down under the pollution control laws. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board have been established to ensure that industries comply with the pollution control laws and regulations. The Boards have the power to issue notices and directions to industries that violate the laws and regulations. However, it is important that the Boards follow the procedures laid down under the laws and regulations while issuing notices and directions.

In the first case, the Appellate Authority set aside the Board's order and remitted the matter back to the Board for reconsideration. This shows that the Appellate Authority is empowered to review the decisions of the Board and ensure that the Board follows the procedures laid down under the laws and regulations. Similarly, in the second case, the court ordered that the procedure under Rule 20-A of the Rules must be followed. This shows that the court is also empowered to ensure that the procedures laid down under the laws and regulations are followed.

The pollution control laws and regulations are in place to protect the environment and the health of the people. Industries that violate these laws and regulations not only harm the environment but also put the health of the people at risk. Therefore, it is important that the Boards and the courts ensure that the procedures laid down under the laws and regulations are followed and that industries comply with the laws and regulations. This will help in protecting the environment and the health of the people.
