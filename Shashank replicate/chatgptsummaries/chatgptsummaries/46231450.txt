The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to challenges against the validity of certain provisions of the Finance Act and Service Tax Rules related to the taxation of services provided by restaurants, hotels, and caterers. The main issue in these cases is whether the Parliament has the legislative competence to levy service tax on composite contracts involving the supply of goods and services, such as catering and short-term accommodation services.

In one case, the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India challenged the constitutional validity of two provisions of the Finance Act 1994 that made the provision of food and beverages in air-conditioned restaurants and hotels amenable to service tax. The petitioners argued that these transactions fell within the meaning of 'sale of goods' and were therefore subject to state sales tax, not service tax levied by Parliament. The court considered relevant constitutional and statutory provisions and ultimately upheld the validity of the challenged provisions.

Another court order pertains to amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, which introduced new services to be taxed, including services provided by air-conditioned restaurants with a liquor license and short-term accommodation in hotels, inns, clubs, guest houses, etc. The amendments were challenged on the grounds of legislative competence. The Finance Act, 2012 was subsequently enacted, introducing new sections and definitions related to service tax. Notifications were issued exempting certain taxable services from service tax. Rule 2C was inserted, determining the value of the service portion involved in the supply of food or drink in a restaurant or as outdoor catering.

The court order also discusses various aspects of service tax levied on the supply of goods and services in restaurants and hotels. It mentions the increase in the value of the service portion of the composite contract of supply of goods and services in a restaurant from 30 to 40%, and the exemption granted from the service tax leviable on short-term accommodation (hotel) service when the declared tariff per day for a hotel room is less than Rs.1000. The order also discusses the liberalization of CENVAT credit chain in the hands of the service provider and the legislative competence of the Parliament to levy service tax. The order also provides a legislative history of the 46th Amendment and the legal history behind it.

The court order states that the service of meals in a hotel or restaurant does not constitute a sale of food for the purpose of levy of sales tax, but must be regarded as the rendering of a service. The court examines the constitutional validity of central taxing statutes on the ground of lack of legislative competence of the Parliament. The court also examines the challenge to the levy of service tax by Parliament on the service portion of a composite contract. The court refers to previous cases and legislative history to make its decision. The court concludes that the supply of food by the restaurant-owner to the customer, though it may be a part of the service that he renders, is what is the subject of the levy.

In another case, the court order discusses the subject of levy on the supply of food and drink in a restaurant and emphasizes that the price paid by the customer cannot be split up. The court also explains the aspect doctrine and how it can be applied to discern the service portion of a composite catering contract. The court disagrees with the argument that there is no service element involved in the supply of food and drinks in a restaurant and distinguishes the services rendered by outdoor catering from those in a restaurant. The court concludes that the service portion of a catering contract can be made exigible to service tax levied by a Union legislation.

The court order also discusses a challenge to the service tax levied on services provided by mandap-keepers and outdoor caterers. The challenge is based on the grounds that it amounts to a tax on land and is beyond the competence of Parliament. The court applies the pith and substance doctrine and concludes that the service portion of a composite catering contract can be made exigible to service tax. The court also examines the challenge to Rule 2-C of the 2006 Rules, which attributes 40% of the value of the composite contract of supply of food and drinks to the service component. The court finds that the legal requisites for the levy and determination of service tax on the service portion are satisfied.

In the final case, the court order upholds the constitutional validity of certain sections and rules related to service tax but strikes down the section pertaining to the levy of service tax on the provision of short-term accommodation. The court finds that taxation by way of administrative instructions without any authority of law is unreasonable and contrary to the Constitution of India. The provision of short-term accommodation in hotels is a taxable event covered by the term 'luxuries' and is outside the legislative competence of Parliament. The writ petition is disposed of with no orders as to costs.

In conclusion, these court orders provide a comprehensive overview of the legal issues surrounding the taxation of services provided by restaurants, hotels, and caterers in India. The court has upheld the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Finance Act and Service Tax Rules while striking down others. The court has also clarified the distinction between the supply of goods and services in these industries and the legislative competence of the Parliament to levy service tax on composite contracts involving the supply of goods and services.
