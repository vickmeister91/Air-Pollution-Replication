The Kerala High Court recently heard a case under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, where the petitioners were accused of water pollution. The petitioners had requested the court to quash the prosecution against them, citing five reasons. The court found that the first reason was not valid, as there was evidence that notice had been issued to the Pollution Control Board. The second reason was that the complaint was not maintainable, but the court found that the complaint had sufficiently notified the accused persons of the nature of the allegations against them. 

The court emphasized the importance of proper pleadings in civil and criminal law. The court order states that the adversary must be notified of the case against them, and that the requirements of pleadings are not just a formality but based on principles of natural justice. The court cannot throw out the prosecution at the threshold based on inadequate pleadings, but must wait for evidence to be presented. 

The court also notes that subsequent actions, such as the establishment of pollution plants and the granting of a license, cannot erase any offense that may have already been committed. The court ultimately dismisses the case, but notes that the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should only be invoked sparingly and in exceptional cases.
