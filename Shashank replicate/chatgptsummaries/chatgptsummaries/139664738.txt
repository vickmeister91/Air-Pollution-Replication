The case at hand involves a dispute between M. Babu and H. Narayana Rao. Babu had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking the production of bill and call details/summary of the mobile numbers of the respondent and Sri Indushekar from Bharathi Airtel Limited. The application was dismissed by the LII Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru, on the grounds that Babu had failed to raise the plea in his 313 statement recorded by the learned Magistrate.

Babu had appealed against the order, arguing that the lower appellate court had erred in dismissing his application. However, the court rejected his appeal, stating that the lower appellate court had rightly held that no such plea had been raised by Babu in his 313 statement. The court further noted that Babu had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that the call details were relevant to the case.

The court's decision highlights the importance of raising all relevant pleas and producing evidence to support them in criminal proceedings. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of an application or appeal, as in the case of Babu. It also underscores the need for parties to carefully consider the relevance and admissibility of evidence before seeking its production.

Overall, the court's order serves as a reminder to litigants and legal practitioners of the importance of following proper procedures and presenting a strong case in court. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in ensuring that justice is served in accordance with the law.
