The High Court of Coimbatore recently passed an order in a criminal revision filed by the Forest Range Officer seeking to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate Court in Mettupalayam. The case involved the interception of nine individuals in possession of meat and skin of a spotted deer in a reserved forest. The accused had used an unlicensed firearm for hunting. The trial court had allowed the accused to retain possession of their motorcycles, which were allegedly used in the crime. 

The Forest Range Officer had filed the criminal revision on the grounds that the trial court's order was erroneous and illegal. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the criminal revision and ordered the setting aside of the trial court's order. The High Court directed the accused to hand over possession of the motorcycles to the Judicial Magistrate within a week, failing which the vehicles would be seized and produced before the court. The trial court was directed to proceed with the trial uninfluenced by the order.

The case involved a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which prohibits hunting of any wild animal, including deer, without a license. The accused had used an unlicensed firearm for hunting, which is a serious offense under the Act. The possession of the meat and skin of the spotted deer was also illegal, as it is a protected species under the Act.

The trial court's order allowing the accused to retain possession of their motorcycles was seen as a lenient approach towards the accused. The Forest Range Officer had argued that the motorcycles were used in the commission of the crime and should be seized as evidence. The High Court agreed with this argument and directed the accused to hand over possession of the motorcycles to the Judicial Magistrate.

The High Court's order is a significant step towards the protection of wildlife and the enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and their habitats and prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, for the conservation of wildlife.

The High Court's order sends a strong message to those who engage in illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife. It emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act and the importance of preserving our natural heritage. The order also highlights the role of the judiciary in upholding the law and protecting the environment.

In conclusion, the High Court's order in the criminal revision filed by the Forest Range Officer is a significant step towards the protection of wildlife and the enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act. The order sets a precedent for strict enforcement of the Act and sends a strong message to those who engage in illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife. The order also highlights the role of the judiciary in upholding the law and protecting the environment.
