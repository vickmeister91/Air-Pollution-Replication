The court has issued an interim relief for OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd, ordering a stay on the effect of clause 4.4 of the Guidelines to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 until the hearing of the application. However, the petitioner cannot claim equity on the basis of any construction made by them taking advantage of this interim order. The court has also directed the petitioner to file an affidavit-in-reply within a fortnight and a rejoinder within a week thereafter. The matter will appear after three weeks on February 8, 2012.

The court's decision comes after OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd filed a petition seeking relief from the effect of clause 4.4 of the Guidelines to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The clause requires the petitioner to obtain clearance from the National Board for Wildlife before any construction activity can take place in a forest area. OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd argued that the clause was causing undue delay in the construction of their power plant, which was already behind schedule.

The court's interim relief will allow OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd to proceed with construction activities without obtaining clearance from the National Board for Wildlife until the hearing of the application. However, the court has made it clear that the petitioner cannot claim equity on the basis of any construction made by them taking advantage of this interim order. This means that if the court ultimately decides against OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd, they may be required to undo any construction that was carried out during the period of the interim relief.

The court has also directed the petitioner to file an affidavit-in-reply within a fortnight and a rejoinder within a week thereafter. This is a standard procedure in court cases, where both parties are given an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence. The court will consider these documents when making a final decision on the matter.

The court has set the next hearing for February 8, 2012, which is three weeks from the date of the interim relief. This gives both parties time to prepare their arguments and evidence. It is also possible that the Union of India, which had not received any instruction despite being served with a copy of the petition on January 12, 2012, may choose to intervene in the case.

In conclusion, the court has issued an interim relief for OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd, allowing them to proceed with construction activities without obtaining clearance from the National Board for Wildlife until the hearing of the application. However, the petitioner cannot claim equity on the basis of any construction made by them taking advantage of this interim order. The court has also directed the petitioner to file an affidavit-in-reply within a fortnight and a rejoinder within a week thereafter. The matter will appear after three weeks on February 8, 2012.
