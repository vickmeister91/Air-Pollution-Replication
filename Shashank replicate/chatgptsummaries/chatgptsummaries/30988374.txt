The court order pertains to a case where a dumper was seized for illegally transporting sand from a sanctuary area. The applicant challenged the order of confiscation of the dumper, arguing that no forest offence had been committed and that the driver of the dumper had not been prosecuted. However, the court rejected these arguments, stating that the sand collected from the sanctuary area was a forest produce and that the dumper could be confiscated under the Indian Forest Act. The court upheld the order of confiscation of the dumper.

In this case, the court had to determine whether the confiscation of the dumper was lawful. The applicant argued that no forest offence had been committed and that the driver of the dumper had not been prosecuted. However, the court rejected these arguments and held that the sand collected from the sanctuary area was a forest produce and that the dumper could be confiscated under the Indian Forest Act.

The Indian Forest Act is a law that regulates the use of forests and forest produce in India. It provides for the protection of forests and the conservation of forest resources. The Act defines forest produce as any produce obtained from a forest, including timber, charcoal, and sand.

In this case, the court held that the sand collected from the sanctuary area was a forest produce and that the dumper used to transport the sand could be confiscated under the Indian Forest Act.

The court also rejected the argument that the driver of the dumper had not been prosecuted. The court held that the confiscation of the dumper was a separate issue from the prosecution of the driver. The court upheld the order of confiscation of the dumper and dismissed the application.
