The court order in question pertains to a civil revision against a judgment passed by the Additional District Judge in a house rent control case. The petitioner in this case was a tenant, while the opposite party was the landlady. The landlady had filed for eviction, and the tenant had challenged the order for payment of arrear house rent. The executing court had rejected the tenant's application under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 

The Additional District Judge held that the House Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to pass an order for the realization of arrear house rent and that the order of eviction was executable. The court found that the order passed by the House Rent Controller for the realization of arrear house rent was without jurisdiction and therefore a nullity and not executable. However, the relief of recovery of possession ordered by the House Rent Controller was executable. 

The court disposed of the civil revision without interfering with the judgment passed by the Additional District Judge. In essence, the court upheld the eviction order but struck down the order for payment of arrear house rent. 

This case highlights the importance of jurisdiction in legal proceedings. The House Rent Controller, in this case, did not have the jurisdiction to pass an order for the realization of arrear house rent. As a result, the order was deemed null and void. 

It is also worth noting that the court did not interfere with the judgment passed by the Additional District Judge. This suggests that the court found no fault with the judge's decision to uphold the eviction order. 

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures and ensuring that the appropriate authorities have jurisdiction over a given matter. Failure to do so can result in legal orders being deemed null and void, as was the case with the order for payment of arrear house rent in this instance.
