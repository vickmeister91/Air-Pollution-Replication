The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Tulsiram, who has been in custody since July 7th, 2017 in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The applicant's counsel argued that he has been implicated in the case based on the memorandum of the main accused, and no recovery has been made by him. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two local sureties.

The court's decision to grant bail to Tulsiram was based on several factors. First, the court noted that Tulsiram had been in custody for a significant period of time, and that there was no evidence to suggest that he posed a flight risk or a danger to society. Additionally, the court found that Tulsiram had not been directly involved in any illegal activity, and that he had been implicated in the case solely on the basis of the memorandum of the main accused.

In granting bail, the court imposed several conditions on Tulsiram. First, he was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two local sureties. This bond was intended to ensure that Tulsiram would appear in court as required and would comply with all the terms and conditions of his bail.

In addition to the bond, the court also imposed several other conditions on Tulsiram. He was required to cooperate fully with the trial and investigation, and to not threaten prosecution witnesses or commit any similar offenses. He was also required to not seek unnecessary adjournments and to mark his presence at the Forest Department Punjapura once a month until the trial was completed.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Tulsiram was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal principles. While the court recognized the seriousness of the charges against Tulsiram, it also recognized that he had been in custody for a significant period of time and that there was no evidence to suggest that he posed a flight risk or a danger to society. By imposing several conditions on Tulsiram's bail, the court sought to ensure that he would comply with all the terms and conditions of his release and would not pose a threat to the community.
