The Delhi High Court recently heard a case in which the Union of India challenged an order by the Central Information Commission (CIC) to provide an attested copy of the summary of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) Report and the report on the Athirappilly Hydro Electric Project, Kerala to the respondent, G Krishnan. The CIC had allowed the appeal of the respondent and directed the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) to publish all reports of commissions, special committees or panels within 30 days of receiving the same, unless it is felt that any part of such report is exempted under the provisions of Section 8(1) and Section 9 of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The Union of India argued that the report was still under consideration of the concerned states and any hasty decision on making the report public without adequate consultative process would lead to misuse of the report, and the same may become a stumbling block in the process of development of the western ghats regions. However, the court order states that the public has a right to know about every public act and transaction by public functionaries, and this right is derived from the concept of freedom of speech. The RTI Act allows citizens to access information held by the government, including information impacting the environment.

The disclosure of the WGEEP report, which has been prepared with public money and has wide ramifications on the environment, would enable citizens to debate in an informed manner and provide useful feedback to the government. The scientific, strategic, and economic interests of the State cannot be at cross purposes with the requirement to protect the environment in accordance with the Environment Protection Act. The court rejects the petitioner's contention that the disclosure of the WGEEP report would impede the decision-making process and adversely affect the scientific or economic interests of the States.

The court order dismisses a petition and upholds an order passed by the CIC, stating that a policy in the public interest cannot be considered against the strategic, scientific or economic interest of the State. The petitioner is obliged to fulfill the order.

The case highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in government decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters impacting the environment. The court's decision reinforces the right of citizens to access information held by the government and to participate in the decision-making process. It also emphasizes the need for the government to balance its scientific, strategic, and economic interests with its obligation to protect the environment.

The WGEEP report is a significant document that provides insights into the ecological status of the Western Ghats region, which is a biodiversity hotspot and home to several endangered species. The report has been the subject of controversy, with some stakeholders arguing that its recommendations would adversely affect the livelihoods of local communities and impede development in the region. However, the court's decision to make the report public will enable citizens to engage in a constructive dialogue with the government and provide feedback on the report's recommendations.

The case also highlights the importance of the RTI Act in promoting transparency and accountability in government decision-making. The Act has been instrumental in empowering citizens to access information held by the government and to hold public functionaries accountable for their actions. The court's decision to uphold the CIC's order reinforces the importance of the Act in promoting transparency and accountability in government decision-making.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision to make the WGEEP report public is a significant step towards promoting transparency and accountability in government decision-making. The decision reinforces the right of citizens to access information held by the government and to participate in the decision-making process. It also emphasizes the need for the government to balance its scientific, strategic, and economic interests with its obligation to protect the environment. The case highlights the importance of the RTI Act in promoting transparency and accountability in government decision-making and empowering citizens to hold public functionaries accountable for their actions.
