The first court order involves a case between M/S Rohtak Delhi Transport Pvt. Ltd. and the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner's buses had been granted stage carriage permits by the State Transport Authority of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) had started challaning the buses on the ground of overtaking, picking up/dropping passengers without a valid bus stop. The documents of the petitioner including R.C. fitness certificate and permits had been seized. The petitioner chose to compound the same by paying fines ranging from Rs. 2100/- to Rs. 3300/-. The petitioner filed a writ petition stating that the acts of the respondents are arbitrary and unjustified and violate his fundamental rights. The court dismissed the petition and held that the judgment of the coordinate Bench of this court reported in the case of Tara Kant Jha & Ors. Vs. State Transport Authority & Others is fully applicable to the facts of the instant case.

The second court order discusses the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the M.C. Mehta case, which laid down several conditions for transport operators in Delhi, including the use of speed control devices, segregation of bus lanes, and enforcement by flying squads. The order also mentions the concern expressed by bus operators that these directions have been used by traffic police to harass them, and the subsequent clarification provided by the Supreme Court in the UPSRTC case. The court suggests that the petitioners seek further clarification from the Supreme Court on the matter.

The third court order states that it has no discretion in the matter and suggests that the petitioners seek clarification from the Supreme Court regarding a previous judgment. The court notes that there is no urgency in the matter and that the interim directions are causing hardship to the respondents. The court upholds the judgment of Tara Kant Jha and disposes of the petition and pending application accordingly.
