The court order pertains to a case where The A.C.C. Limited filed a suit for permanent injunction against Punjab State Power Corporation Limited to prevent them from disrupting the supply of dry fly ash. The petitioner had signed an agreement with the respondent in 1995 to lift dry fly ash from Ropar Thermal Plant and transport it to its cement plants annually. The dispute arose when the respondent stopped the supply of dry fly ash, and the petitioner filed a suit for the same. The lower appellate court partially rejected the petitioner's plea for interim relief, which was challenged in the present petition. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order discusses a dispute between two parties over the supply of dry fly ash. The petitioner claims that a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by both parties and that they had been adhering to its terms. The respondent disputes the validity of the Memorandum and claims that the petitioner is only entitled to lift a certain amount of dry fly ash. The court finds that further evidence is required to make a decision and notes that the petitioner is seeking an interim measure to receive unlimited supply of dry fly ash. The court also considers correspondence between the parties and a chart of availability and disposal of dry fly ash.

The court order discusses a dispute over the supply and pricing of dry fly ash between a petitioner and a respondent. The court notes that there is some variation in the available quantity of dry fly ash during different months, and that the respondent has already tied up for supply of 11.50 LTPA of dry fly ash with other parties. The court permits the petitioner to lift the available quantity of dry fly ash by paying a tentative price of ` 400/- per metric ton subject to the final decision in the suit regarding its entitlement and the rates. The court refrains from commenting on the maintainability of the suit.
