The Supreme Court of India has issued a court order regarding a report of a High Level Working Group that has taken exception to certain recommendations made in the Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel Report. The learned Solicitor General of India informed the court about this report, and the court has instructed the appellant to bring this fact to the notice of the National Green Tribunal by filing an appropriate application.

The court has disposed of the civil appeal and granted liberty to the appellant to make an appropriate application. However, the court has clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the submission made by the learned Solicitor General.

The Western Ghats are a mountain range that runs parallel to the western coast of India. The region is known for its rich biodiversity and is home to many endangered species. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel was set up by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010 to assess the ecological status of the region and make recommendations for its conservation.

The panel submitted its report in 2011, which included recommendations for the protection of the Western Ghats. However, the report was met with opposition from various groups, including the mining and real estate industries, who claimed that the recommendations would hurt their businesses.

In response to this opposition, the Ministry of Environment and Forests set up a High Level Working Group to review the report. The group submitted its report in 2013, which took exception to certain recommendations made in the original report.

The court order regarding this report is significant because it highlights the ongoing debate over the conservation of the Western Ghats. The region is under threat from various human activities, including mining, deforestation, and urbanization. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel Report was an attempt to address these threats and protect the region's biodiversity.

However, the opposition to the report shows that there are powerful interests that are opposed to its recommendations. The court order instructing the appellant to bring the High Level Working Group report to the notice of the National Green Tribunal is a step towards ensuring that all relevant information is considered in the ongoing debate over the conservation of the Western Ghats.

The court's clarification that it has not expressed any opinion on the submission made by the learned Solicitor General is also significant. It shows that the court is not taking sides in the debate and is instead focused on ensuring that all relevant information is considered.

In conclusion, the court order regarding the High Level Working Group report on the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel Report is an important development in the ongoing debate over the conservation of the Western Ghats. The court's instruction to the appellant to bring the report to the notice of the National Green Tribunal is a step towards ensuring that all relevant information is considered. The court's clarification that it has not expressed any opinion on the submission made by the learned Solicitor General shows that the court is impartial and focused on ensuring that the best decision is made for the conservation of the Western Ghats.
