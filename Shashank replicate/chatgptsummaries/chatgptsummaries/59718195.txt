In this case, Bhatia had approached the High Court seeking relief against the order passed by the Magistrate in the criminal complaint filed against him by M/s Aditya Tyres.

The complaint filed by M/s Aditya Tyres against Bhatia alleged that he had cheated the company by supplying sub-standard material. Bhatia had denied the allegations and had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking production of certain documents from M/s Aditya Tyres to prove his innocence.

The Magistrate had passed an order directing M/s Aditya Tyres to produce the documents sought by Bhatia. However, the company had failed to comply with the order and had sought time to produce the documents. Bhatia had then filed an application before the Magistrate seeking direction to M/s Aditya Tyres to produce the documents.

The Magistrate had dismissed Bhatia's application on the ground that he had already passed an order directing M/s Aditya Tyres to produce the documents and that the company had sought time to comply with the order. The Magistrate had then proceeded with the cross-examination of the complainant.

Bhatia had challenged the Magistrate's order before the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The High Court had directed the Magistrate to dispose of Bhatia's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. before proceeding with the cross-examination of the complainant.
