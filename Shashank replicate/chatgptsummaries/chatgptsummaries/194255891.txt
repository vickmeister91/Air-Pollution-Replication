The Wildlife department filed a criminal appeal against Mohd Hasin for being found in possession of a tiger skin, a protected species under the Wildlife Act. The accused failed to provide a legal source of procurement or a license to possess the skin, and it was seized. The trial court acquitted the accused on the grounds that no public witness was examined and the case property was not produced immediately after seizure. However, the additional sessions judge found that the trial court had committed a grave error in appreciating the evidence and that the raiding party was constituted on receipt of secret information. The judge concluded that the accused was in possession of the tiger skin, and the appeal was allowed.

The court order states that four witnesses have identified a tiger skin recovered from the possession of the accused, and their testimonies have remained firm and credible. The court also notes that the absence of independent witnesses does not necessarily mean the case is false, and that the defense witnesses were unable to prove the accused's innocence. The court concludes that the trial court did not appreciate the evidence properly and convicts the accused under various sections of the Wildlife (P) Act, 1972.

The court order dated March 21, 2013, has been set aside, and the appellant/accused has been convicted under various sections of the Wildlife (P) Act, 1972, and is punishable under section 51 of the same act. The announcement was made in open court on May 2, 2014, by the Additional Sessions Judge (Central) in Delhi.
