The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Kukkehalli Grama Panchayat against an order passed by the Executive Officer of the Taluka Panchayat. The order allowed Kohinoor Industries to establish a factory for deep freezing of fishes meant for export. The Grama Panchayat had sought to annul the license issued under Section 66 of the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993. However, the court held that since the 3rd respondent had obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board and Section 66 empowered the Grama Panchayat to issue a license for such factories, the order of the Executive Officer could not be challenged.

The case revolved around the interpretation of Section 66 of the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, which empowers Grama Panchayats to issue licenses for factories that are not hazardous to health or the environment. The Grama Panchayat argued that the factory would cause pollution and harm the environment, and therefore, the license should be annulled. However, the court held that the Pollution Control Board had already granted consent to the factory, and therefore, the Grama Panchayat's argument was not valid.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the power of Grama Panchayats to issue licenses for factories that are not hazardous to health or the environment. It also highlights the importance of obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board before establishing such factories.

The case also raises questions about the balance between economic development and environmental protection. While the establishment of the factory would create jobs and boost the local economy, it could also harm the environment and the health of the local population. The court's decision suggests that economic development should not come at the cost of environmental protection, and that both should be given equal importance.

Overall, the Karnataka High Court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary approvals before establishing factories or other industrial units. It also highlights the need for a balanced approach to economic development and environmental protection.
