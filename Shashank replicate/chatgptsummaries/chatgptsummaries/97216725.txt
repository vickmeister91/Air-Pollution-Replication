The Madras High Court recently issued a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, requesting a writ of mandamus to direct the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board to take action against a respondent for causing air pollution in the process of burning coconut shells in his industry. However, the petitioner did not appear in court, and the respondents provided evidence that the unit had been closed for ten years and that there was no other activity on the land. As a result, the court closed the case, and no costs were awarded.

The writ petition was filed by an individual who sought to direct the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board to take action against a respondent for causing air pollution in the process of burning coconut shells in his industry. The petitioner claimed that the respondent's activities were causing air pollution and that the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board had failed to take any action against the respondent.

However, when the case came up for hearing, the petitioner did not appear in court. The respondents, on the other hand, provided evidence that the unit had been closed for ten years and that there was no other activity on the land. The respondents also argued that the petitioner had filed the writ petition without any basis and that the court should dismiss the case.

After considering the evidence presented by the respondents, the court found that the petitioner had failed to establish any case against the respondent. The court also noted that the petitioner had not appeared in court to argue his case. As a result, the court closed the case and did not award any costs to either party.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of presenting evidence to support one's case in court. In this case, the respondents were able to provide evidence that the unit had been closed for ten years and that there was no other activity on the land. This evidence was crucial in convincing the court to dismiss the case.

The court's decision also underscores the need for individuals to appear in court to argue their case. In this case, the petitioner did not appear in court, which weakened his case and made it easier for the respondents to argue for dismissal.

Overall, the Madras High Court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of presenting evidence and appearing in court to argue one's case. It also highlights the need for individuals to have a strong basis for filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
