In the first court order, Sh. Mange Ram filed a suit for permanent injunction against Smt. Asha Gupta and others. The plaintiff claimed to have been a tenant in two shops since 1958 and 1962, respectively, and has been in continuous possession of the same. The defendants allegedly harassed and threatened the plaintiff, filed an eviction petition, and caused damage to the shops. The defendants denied the allegations and claimed that the plaintiff was running a flour mill in a residential area against the directions of the Supreme Court.

The court heard both parties and restrained the defendants from illegally dispossessing the plaintiff and causing any damage to the shops. The court order was passed to prevent any further damage to the property and to ensure that the plaintiff's rights as a tenant were protected. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties and the law governing the rights of tenants and landlords.

In the second court order, the plaintiff and defendants were in a dispute over the repair of a roof. The matter was referred to mediation, but no settlement was reached. The defendants failed to appear in court and comply with an order to carry out necessary repairs. A local commissioner was appointed to assess the damage and suggest measures for repair.

The plaintiff proved his case with various documents and testimony, and a decree was passed in his favor for permanent injunction and costs. The defendants were directed not to cause any further damage to the property. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by the plaintiff and the failure of the defendants to comply with the court's orders.

In both court orders, the court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties and the law governing the rights of tenants and landlords. The court's primary concern was to protect the rights of the tenants and prevent any further damage to the property. The court's decision was also based on the failure of the defendants to comply with the court's orders and the evidence presented by the plaintiff.

In conclusion, the court orders were passed to protect the rights of the tenants and prevent any further damage to the property. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties and the law governing the rights of tenants and landlords. The court's decision was also based on the failure of the defendants to comply with the court's orders and the evidence presented by the plaintiff.
