The case in question involves a petitioner who challenged an order passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge No.1, Jodhpur in appeal. The petitioner had filed an application for summoning certain documents from the complainant and for recalling the complainant for further examination. However, the application was rejected by the Appellate Court, which found that the application was malafide and ill-aimed just to delay the decision of the appeal.

As a result of this decision, the petitioner was saddled with a cost of Rs. 10,000/- and was directed to deposit the cost in the Appellate Court within a period of one month. Failure to do so would result in the petitioner not being permitted to argue the appeal. The learned Appellate Court was also directed to decide the appeal within three months from the date of the order.

The decision of the Appellate Court was based on the fact that the petitioner's application for summoning certain documents and recalling the complainant for further examination was deemed to be malafide and ill-aimed. The Court found that the application was simply an attempt to delay the decision of the appeal, rather than a genuine attempt to seek justice.

The Court's decision to impose a cost of Rs. 10,000/- on the petitioner was intended to discourage such malafide and ill-aimed applications in the future. By imposing a cost, the Court hoped to send a message that such applications would not be tolerated and that litigants must come to Court with genuine grievances and not with the intention of delaying the proceedings.

The Court's decision to direct the petitioner to deposit the cost within a period of one month was also significant. This was intended to ensure that the petitioner did not delay the proceedings any further by failing to comply with the Court's order. Failure to deposit the cost within the given period would result in the petitioner not being permitted to argue the appeal, which would further delay the proceedings.

Finally, the Court's direction to the learned Appellate Court to decide the appeal within three months from the date of the order was intended to ensure that the proceedings were not delayed any further. The Court recognized that justice delayed is justice denied and therefore, it was important to ensure that the appeal was decided within a reasonable period of time.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case was intended to discourage litigants from filing malafide and ill-aimed applications in order to delay the proceedings. By imposing a cost on the petitioner and directing the petitioner to deposit the cost within a period of one month, the Court hoped to send a message that such applications would not be tolerated. The Court's direction to the learned Appellate Court to decide the appeal within three months from the date of the order was also significant, as it was intended to ensure that justice was not delayed any further.
