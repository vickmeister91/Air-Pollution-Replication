The court orders discussed in this article pertain to a dispute over the construction of a new bus stand in Tindivanam town, Tamil Nadu, on land classified as Eri, which is a rain-fed water body. The petitioner in the case argues that the government's decision to establish the bus stand on Eri land is illegal and contrary to law, as it goes against the government's own guidelines for protecting water bodies. The petitioner also argues that the government did not consider the impact of the transfer of the Eri land for the proposed new bus stand and that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was not consulted.

The government, on the other hand, argues that only a small portion of the Eri is being used for the bus stand and that the decision was made in the public interest, after considering all relevant factors. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was also involved in the case and issued a consent order with conditions to safeguard the environment and preserve the water body.

The court examines the principles of sustainable development and the need to balance developmental needs with the protection of the environment and ecology. The court also considers previous decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and concludes that the government's action is arbitrary and against the law. The court emphasizes that natural resources such as lakes, forests, rivers, and wildlife are held by the state as a trustee of the public and can only be disposed of in a manner consistent with this trust. The court must balance sustainable development and environmental protection.

In this case, the court found that the notification issued by the Central Government does not apply to the construction of a new bus stand in Tindivanam, Tamil Nadu, and that the Pollution Control Board conducted a scientific assessment and imposed conditions to safeguard public interest and preserve the area. The court allowed the construction of the bus stand but required the Eri to be deepened or the tank bund to be increased before the project could commence, and the Pollution Control Board to certify compliance.

The court order states that before the construction of a new bus stand can begin, respondents 2 and 3 must ensure that the Eri is deepened or the tank bund is increased to the required height. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board must inspect and certify compliance before the municipality can commence the project. No costs are to be incurred, and all connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of protecting natural resources and balancing developmental needs with environmental protection. The court recognizes that natural resources are held by the state as a trustee of the public and must be disposed of in a manner consistent with this trust. The court also emphasizes the need to consider the impact of developmental projects on the environment and ecology and to take steps to safeguard public interest and preserve natural resources. In this case, the court allowed the construction of the bus stand but imposed conditions to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and protect the Eri.
