The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint filed by Lt. Col. Dalvinder Singh against Puma Realtors Pvt Ltd. The complainant alleged that the company did not carry out the promised internal developments and did not deliver physical possession of the plot within the agreed-upon time frame. The company offered paper possession instead of a refund, and the complainant sought a refund of the amount paid along with interest and compensation for mental agony and physical harassment. 

The company argued that the complaint was liable to be dismissed due to the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement and that the complaint was not covered under the Consumer Protection Act. However, the Commission found in favor of the complainant and ordered the company to refund the amount paid along with interest and compensation. 

The court order discusses whether a consumer complaint can be settled through arbitration when there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court cites previous judgments and concludes that the existence of an arbitration clause does not prevent consumer fora from entertaining complaints filed by consumers. The court also considers whether the complainant was a speculator or a consumer, and concludes that the complainant purchased the plot for residential purposes and is therefore a consumer. 

The court order states that the complainant is a consumer under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act and the objection raised by the opposite parties is devoid of merit. The court also rejects the objection raised by the opposite parties that the allegations contained in the complaint relate to specific clauses of the Agreement relating to sale and purchase of an immovable property, which could only be raised before and dealt with by a Civil Court. The court further states that the complainant hired the services of the opposite parties for purchasing the plot and housing/construction comes within the definition of a service. The court also rejects the objection raised by the opposite parties that existence of Clause 35 in the Buyers Agreement bars the territorial jurisdiction of this Commission to entertain and try the complaint. 

The court order discusses a dispute between a complainant and the opposite parties regarding the possession of a plot. The court rejects the opposite parties' argument that the jurisdiction of the court is limited and that the complainant cannot claim a refund of the entire amount deposited. The court also finds that the opposite parties did not provide all basic facilities and amenities as promised, and that the possession offered was not legal and valid. Therefore, the complainant is entitled to a refund of the amount deposited. The court also criticizes the clause in the agreement that allows the opposite parties to charge interest for any delay in payment but does not allow the complainant to invoke Clause 11.3 of the agreement after the dispatch of the notice of possession. 

The court order states that the complainant is entitled to a refund of the amount paid for a plot of land, along with interest at a rate of 12% compounded quarterly, due to the Opposite Parties' failure to provide legal and valid possession of the plot with complete development and basic amenities within the stipulated period. The Opposite Parties are also directed to pay compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service, and unfair trade practices. The complainant is entitled to interest from the date of filing the complaint until realization. If the payment is not made within the stipulated period, the Opposite Parties will be liable to pay penal interest. The court also mentions that if the complainant has availed a loan facility, the financial institution will have the first charge on the amount payable. 

In summary, the court order pertains to a complaint filed by Lt. Col. Dalvinder Singh against Puma Realtors Pvt Ltd. The complainant alleged that the company did not carry out the promised internal developments and did not deliver physical possession of the plot within the agreed-upon time frame.
