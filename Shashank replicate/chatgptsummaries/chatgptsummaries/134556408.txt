The court orders discussed various aspects related to electricity services in Tamil Nadu, India. One of the orders dealt with a writ petition filed by N. Mohamed Kani, who sought a Writ of Mandamus to direct the Assistant Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to assess the correct electricity consumption charges for his electricity connection. The petitioner claimed that he had paid the current consumption charges regularly and that the electricity meter was defective. However, the court found that the petitioner had not exhausted the alternative remedy available to him and dismissed the writ petition.

Another court order outlined regulations for the supply of electricity to consumers, including categories of supply and charges recoverable by the licensee. The charges included tariff-related charges, miscellaneous charges, and minimum charges where applicable. The order also included provisions for capacitor compensation charges, excess demand charges, excess contracted load charges, belated payment surcharge, and additional security deposit. The regulations also specified requirements for power factor, harmonics dumping, and the use of electric motors in agricultural service connections. The adequacy of security deposits may be reviewed and refixed periodically.

The court order also covered various charges and procedures related to electricity services. It specified security deposit amounts for different billing categories, interest rates, and procedures for adjusting excess deposits or using them to pay overdue bills. The order also covered charges for service and line shifting, name transfers, reconnection, meter replacement, and dishonored checks. It outlined minimum charges for connections and installation procedures for meters, including recalibration and replacement. Finally, the order covered meter reading and billing intervals.

Another court order discussed regulations related to the disposal or lease of properties or businesses that receive electricity supply. If a consumer fails to give advance notice of such disposal or lease, the licensee has the right to recover charges even beyond the date of disposal or lease. The order also outlined the process for disconnection of supply in case of non-payment of dues and the establishment of a forum for redressal of grievances of consumers. The court also discussed the maintainability of writ petitions when an alternative remedy is available and cited various precedents. Finally, the order mentioned the regulations for consumer grievance redressal forum and electricity ombudsman framed by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Another court order outlined the regulations for the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum in Tamil Nadu, India. The order defined terms such as "complainant," "consumer," and "defect," and outlined the jurisdiction and procedures for filing complaints with the forum. The forum is responsible for addressing grievances related to electricity service, including defects, deficiencies, and unfair trade practices. The order also included a complaint format to be used when filing a complaint with the forum. The forum is required to submit a report to the Commission on the number of complaints received, redressed, and pending for each quarter of the year.

The court also discussed various cases where the maintainability of writ petitions challenging electricity bills and disconnection notices were objected to on the grounds of availability of an alternative remedy before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum. The court cited the judgment of the Apex Court in Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission Vs. Reliance Energy Ltd. (2007) 8 SCC 381, which held that wherever a forum/ombudsman has been created, consumers can only resort to these bodies for redressal of their grievances. The court also cited various High Court judgments that have followed this principle and dismissed writ petitions as not maintainable.

Another court order discussed the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, which provide a comprehensive procedure for addressing complaints related to electricity service, including supply, metering, billing, and maintenance. The court emphasized that this forum, presided over by a Superintending Engineer and two other members, is competent to adjudicate all issues and disputes related to electricity service. The court also noted that an alternative and efficacious remedy is available through this forum, and that a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is not maintainable unless there are exceptional circumstances. The court further explained that the forum has the power to pass appropriate interim orders in cases of disconnection or penal action, and that the remedy provided under the statute should be meaningful and not onerous.

In another court order, the court ruled that an appellate tribunal has the power to stay proceedings if it may result in causing further harm to the appellant. The court also reviewed a dispute over electricity consumption charges and concluded that the assessment was made in accordance with statutory provisions and regulations. The court emphasized that judicial review is not an appeal, but a review of the decision-making process.

Finally, the court order stated that the assessment of the Supply Code, 2004 should be based on any consecutive four months period during the preceding twelve months when the conditions of working were similar to those in the period covered by the billing. The petitioner was seeking to assess the average of the electricity supplied during the period when the meter was defective, which was not acceptable. The court found no illegality in the decision-making process and dismissed the writ petition. The matter of disconnection of supply is to be adjudicated before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.
