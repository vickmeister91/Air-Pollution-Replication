The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner had given a cheque of Rs. 10,00,000/- to the respondent as a security for the sale of a house. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for taking on record an agreement between the petitioner and the respondent which would reveal that the cheque was given by way of surety. However, the application was dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class on the ground that it was filed to delay the proceedings.

The petitioner then filed a criminal revision which was dismissed by the Court of learned Second Additional Session Judge, Shahdol on the ground that an order dismissing an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C is an interlocutory order. The petitioner was not satisfied with this decision and filed a petition in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur allowed the petition with a cost of Rs. 5,000/- to be given to the respondent before the trial court.
