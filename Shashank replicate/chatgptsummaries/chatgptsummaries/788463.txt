The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner had challenged the cancellation of his promotion from Lab Attendant to Lab Technician/Store Keeper, Gr. II, on the grounds of violation of natural justice. The respondents had argued that the promotion was granted in violation of the rules as the petitioner did not possess the required qualifications. The court had to determine whether the principles of natural justice were applicable in this case and whether the cancellation of the promotion was justified.

The court held that the principles of natural justice cannot be invoked in all cases and their applicability has to be judged in the facts and circumstances of each case. In this case, since the petitioner did not possess the required qualifications, giving a show-cause notice would not make any difference to the conclusion. Therefore, the court refused to interfere with the cancellation of the promotion.

The court also rejected the argument that the petitioner suffered adverse civil consequences and that the order should be quashed. The court believed that issuing a writ in favor of the petitioner would result in perpetuating an illegality. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition and ordered the refund of any security amount.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner did not possess the necessary qualifications for a promotion and that the promotion was cancelled due to this fact. The court believed that giving a show-cause notice would not change the illegality of the situation. The court also believed that issuing a writ in favor of the petitioner would result in perpetuating an illegality.

The court's decision highlights the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations when it comes to promotions and appointments. It also emphasizes the need to carefully consider the facts and circumstances of each case before invoking the principles of natural justice. In this case, the court found that the cancellation of the promotion was justified as the petitioner did not possess the required qualifications.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder to employers and employees alike to ensure that all promotions and appointments are made in accordance with the rules and regulations and that the principles of natural justice are applied judiciously in each case.
