The Madras High Court recently heard a case involving M/S.Black Gold Technologies and the Union of India regarding the release of imported goods. The goods in question were "Used Rubber Tyre Cut in Two Pieces" and were meant for manufacturing "rubber crumbs" for road laying. However, customs authorities found that the goods had been misdeclared and seized the entire cargo for further investigation. The petitioners requested provisional release, but the request was not granted. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a common order.

The court order pertains to a case in Alwar, Rajasthan where the respondents have seized goods that were restricted for import as per the Foreign Trade Policy. The importer did not obtain valid licenses from DGFT, and the goods were rightly seized. The goods also constitute hazardous waste, and therefore, the prayer for provisional release is not maintainable. The court heard arguments from both sides and relied on provisions of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. The court order includes specific provisions from the rules related to hazardous waste and other wastes, as well as the procedure for import of hazardous and other wastes.

The court order states that there are certain requirements for importing waste into India, including obtaining necessary licenses and authorizations, maintaining records, and filing annual returns. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change must examine applications for import and grant permission within 60 days, subject to certain conditions. Importers must also ensure that shipments are accompanied by necessary documents and test reports. Importing hazardous or other wastes without permission is deemed illegal.

The court order states that the import of hazardous or other waste is illegal without permission from the Central Government or if the permission was obtained through falsification, misrepresentation, or fraud. If the waste does not conform to the shipping details or results in deliberate disposal in contravention of the Basel Convention and international or domestic law, it is also illegal. In case of illegal import, the importer must re-export the waste at their cost within 90 days. The rules have been made under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which has an overriding effect on other laws. The court also cites previous cases and distinguishes the case at hand from them.

The court order pertains to a case where the petitioners are accused of misdeclaring imported goods. The relevant chapter heading is mentioned, which restricts the import of used rubber tyres with one cut in bead wire and allows the import of used rubbers tubes cut in two pieces. The court debates whether the import is restricted or free and whether the request for provisional release of the goods can be opposed. The court cites a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a similar case and concludes that the customs authorities cannot be said to be unjustified in detaining the consignment if the necessary authorization for import is not obtained. The court also mentions the provisions of the Foreign Trade Act and the Foreign Trade (Regulation) Rules, 1993, which provide for confiscation of goods in the event of contravention of the Act, Rules, or Orders.

The court order discusses the import of used Multifunction Print and Copying Machines (MFDs) and the regulations surrounding their importation. The court concludes that the MFDs were not prohibited but restricted items for import and that the importer was entitled to redeem the consignment on payment of the market price at the reassessed value by the customs authorities with a fine. The court also notes that the Central Government had permitted the import of used MFDs with utility for at least five years and that the MFDs were classified as "other wastes" under the Waste Management Rules. The court distinguishes this case from a previous case and dismisses the appeals filed by the Commissioner of Customs.

The court order discusses the permissibility of provisional release of imported goods under certain conditions. The court distinguishes a previous Division Bench decision and notes that the import of goods is free or restricted, but not prohibited. The court also references Section 110A of the Customs Act, which allows for provisional release of seized goods pending adjudication. The court addresses a contention regarding Rule 12 (4) r/w.Rule 15 and cites previous case law in support of the petitioner's argument.

The court order in the case of City Office Equipments vs. Commissioner of Customs states that despite the fact that certain goods are restricted in terms of the Foreign Trade Policy, there is no bar for their release. The customs authorities cannot insist on re-export unless specified in the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary) Rules, 2016. The petitioners are entitled to provisional release of the goods under Section 110A of the Customs Act, 1962, and no demurrage and detention charges shall be levied on them. The adjudication proceedings will continue, and the respondents are directed to release the goods after assessing and collecting the customs duty and other charges provisionally within three weeks. The writ petitions are allowed, and no costs are imposed.

The court order involves three parties: the Department of Revenue in New Delhi, the Commissioner of Customs and the Assistant Commissioner of Customs in Tuticorin. The case number is W.P.(MD)NO.1242 OF 2020 & batch and the date of the order is August 25, 2020. The order can be found on the website http://www.jud
