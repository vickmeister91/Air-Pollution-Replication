The court order pertains to the construction of infrastructure for the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Delhi, particularly on the Yamuna riverbed. Environmentalists filed two petitions against the construction, arguing that it will damage the river's ecology and floodplain irreversibly. The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus and various orders/directions/declarations to halt the construction and protect the river's ecology. The court reserved its judgment on February 2, 2008, and pronounced it on November 3, 2008.

In one case, the petitioners sought to stop the construction of permanent structures on the riverbed of the Yamuna river in Delhi for the Commonwealth Games Village and the Delhi Metro rail project. The respondents argued that the construction is necessary for the development of the city and national prestige. The court addresses a preliminary objection raised by the respondents regarding the delay in filing the petition but decides to hear the case on its merits. The petitioners argue that the Environmental Clearance granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests is faulty and vitiated. They claim that the construction goes against the recommendations of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the Doctrine of Public Trust. The court order discusses the NEERI reports and the contradictions in the report submitted by the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) to the MoEF.

The court order also mentions the illegal construction being carried out by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in the riverbed between ITO project road to Nizamuddin project road. The court order emphasizes that the river bed is to be restored to its original position and that no structure, whether it pertains to religious, residential, commercial, or any other purpose, shall be allowed to exist.

The court order directs a committee to remove encroachments up to 300 meters from both sides of the Yamuna river and to redevelop it as a habitat for trees, forests, and recreation. The order also prohibits any structure or activity that may cause pollution or damage to the river and its floodplain. The petitioners argue that rivers need legal protection, and a committee was formed to draft a River Regulation Zone notification, but it has not been notified yet. The respondents argue that the Commonwealth Games village site is not in the floodplain and has necessary clearances from concerned authorities. They also argue that there is no violation of NEERI guidelines.

The court order discusses the concept of sustainable development and its importance in protecting the environment. The Constitution of India enshrines environmental protection as a state goal, and preservation and protection of the environment are part of Article 21. The court emphasizes the importance of implementing the Constitutional philosophy laid down in Articles 48A and 51A(g) pertaining to environment, preservation of forests, wild life, rivers, and lakes. The court also discusses the harmful effects of development on the ecosystem, including global warming, sea level rise, and acid rain. The court emphasizes the need to strike a balance between development and ecology and implement sustainable development.

The court order emphasizes the principles of sustainable development, which include caring for the earth, taking only what can be replenished, and respecting nature's limits. The court also acknowledges the importance of inter-generational equity, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle in sustainable development. The court enforces the doctrine of public trust, which obligates the state to conserve natural resources for public use and prohibits their transfer to private ownership. The court emphasizes the need for environmental awareness and scientific assessment of the ecological impact of developmental schemes. The court also recognizes the right to access clean drinking water as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses the Public Trust Doctrine, which states that natural resources should be freely available to everyone and protected by the government for the benefit of the general public. The doctrine imposes restrictions on governmental authority, including that the property subject to the trust must be held available for use by the general public, may not be sold, and must be maintained for particular types of uses. The court order cites the example of the Mono Lake case, where the public trust doctrine was used to protect the ecological values of the lake from water diversions by the city of Los Angeles. The court concludes that the public trust doctrine extends beyond traditional uses such as navigation, commerce, and fishing, and includes protecting all ecologically important lands.

The court order discusses the principle of inter-generational equity, which emphasizes the responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations. The court asserts that economic growth cannot supersede environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. The court also discusses the precautionary principle, which involves anticipating environmental harm and taking measures to avoid it. The court emphasizes the need for sustainability in development and the importance of protecting the environment for its own sake. The court cites various laws and court decisions that stress the need for environmental protection and conservation of natural resources.

The court order discusses the deteriorating condition of the Yamuna river in Delhi, which has become severely polluted and is referred to as a dead river. The court notes that various organizations have launched projects to clean the river, but nothing has been successful so far. The court emphasizes the need to balance economic development with environmental protection and orders the government to take remedial action to remove sludge and strengthen environment protection measures.

The court order discusses the preparations for the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, including the need for adequate infrastructure and facilities such as hotels,
