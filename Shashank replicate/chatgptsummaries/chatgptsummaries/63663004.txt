In a recent court order, the ownership license of a petitioner for wildlife protection was cancelled without giving her a reasonable opportunity of hearing. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that it was passed contrary to the provisions of Section 45 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has directed the respondents to file an additional return stating whether the petitioner was given an opportunity of hearing before the order was passed.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife in India. It provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The Act also provides for the issuance of licenses for ownership of wildlife, which are subject to certain conditions.

In the present case, the petitioner had obtained a license for ownership of wildlife, which was subsequently cancelled without giving her a reasonable opportunity of hearing. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that it was passed contrary to the provisions of Section 45 of the Act, which provides for the procedure for cancellation of licenses.

Section 45 of the Act states that no license for ownership of wildlife shall be cancelled except after giving the licensee a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The section also provides for the issuance of a notice to the licensee, specifying the grounds on which the license is proposed to be cancelled, and giving the licensee a reasonable time to show cause why the license should not be cancelled.

In the present case, the court found that the petitioner was not given a reasonable opportunity of hearing before the order for cancellation of her license was passed. The court also found that the respondents had not issued a notice to the petitioner, specifying the grounds on which the license was proposed to be cancelled, and giving her a reasonable time to show cause why the license should not be cancelled.

In light of these findings, the court directed the respondents to file an additional return stating whether the petitioner was given an opportunity of hearing before the order was passed. The court also directed the respondents to provide a copy of the notice, if any, issued to the petitioner, specifying the grounds on which the license was proposed to be cancelled.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the importance of due process in the cancellation of licenses for ownership of wildlife. It also highlights the need for strict adherence to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, in order to ensure the effective protection of wildlife in India.

In conclusion, the court's order in the present case serves as a reminder of the importance of due process in the cancellation of licenses for ownership of wildlife. It also underscores the need for strict adherence to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, in order to ensure the effective protection of wildlife in India. The court's direction to the respondents to file an additional return and provide a copy of the notice, if any, issued to the petitioner, will help to ensure that the petitioner's rights are protected and that due process is followed in the cancellation of her license.
