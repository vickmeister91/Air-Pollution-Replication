The court has issued several orders related to employment disputes between workers and M/s Lancer Convent Senior Secondary School. In the first case, a worker filed a direct claim against their illegal dismissal from the school. The worker was appointed as a driver in July 2003 and was earning a monthly salary of Rs. 8088. The management was not providing legal facilities according to labor laws, and the worker was demanding them, but their demands were not met. The management officials were pressuring the worker to take back the case, and when the worker refused, they conspired to terminate him. The management refuted the allegations and stated that the worker was dismissed after a fair domestic inquiry. 

The court found that the worker was regularly employed since July 2003 and his last drawn wages were Rs. 8088. The court also held that the domestic inquiry was conducted fairly and according to the principles of natural justice. However, in the second case, the court decided that the termination of the workman's services by the management was not illegal or unjustified as the workman had been challaned for over-speeding, which violated the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India and the Government of NCT of Delhi. Therefore, the act of the management to terminate the workman cannot be said to be illegal.

In the third case, the court found that the termination of a workman's service by the management is not illegal because the workman cannot be used as a driver, which violates guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India and the Government of NCT of Delhi. However, the termination is illegal because there was a pending dispute of general demand and the management did not seek approval under section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act. The court cites a previous judgment to support the mandatory nature of the proviso to comply with the conditions stated therein. The court also notes that the relief of reinstatement is not automatic and compensation in lieu of reinstatement or back wages may be appropriate.

In the fourth case, the court ordered that a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 should be paid to each of the appellants as compensation for their termination from employment. The court cites previous cases where compensation instead of reinstatement with back wages has been deemed appropriate. The claimant in this case violated guidelines and cannot be reinstated, but is entitled to compensation. The court awards a lump-sum compensation of Rs. 75,000 to the claimant in lieu of reinstatement, back wages, and other benefits. The award is to be published and the file is to be consigned to the record room.

Overall, the court has issued various orders related to employment disputes between workers and M/s Lancer Convent Senior Secondary School. While some cases resulted in the termination of the worker's services being deemed legal, others resulted in compensation being awarded to the claimant. The court emphasized the importance of complying with labor laws and conducting fair domestic inquiries when terminating an employee's services.
