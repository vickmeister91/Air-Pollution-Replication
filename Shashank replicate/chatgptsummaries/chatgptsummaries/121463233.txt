The court order pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed by a petitioner who sought protection from harassment by the police under the guise of an enquiry on a summon. The police were conducting a preliminary enquiry on a complaint against the petitioner, and the petitioner was directed to cooperate with the police during the enquiry. The court order clarified that the police cannot call the petitioner on a regular basis without registering an FIR. However, if any cognizable offence is made out during the enquiry, the police are free to register an FIR.

The court order emphasized that the petitioner was not shielded from legal action and that the Criminal Original Petition was closed. This means that the petitioner's request for protection from harassment by the police was not granted by the court. The court order also implies that the petitioner was not able to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim of harassment by the police.

The court's decision to close the Criminal Original Petition indicates that the petitioner's case did not have sufficient merit to warrant further legal action. It is important to note that the court's decision does not necessarily mean that the petitioner's claims were false or baseless. It simply means that the court did not find sufficient evidence to support the petitioner's claims.

The court's order also highlights the importance of cooperation between the police and the public during investigations. The court directed the petitioner to cooperate with the police during the enquiry, indicating that cooperation is essential for the smooth functioning of the justice system. However, the court also emphasized that the police cannot call the petitioner on a regular basis without registering an FIR, which is an important safeguard against harassment by the police.

Overall, the court order provides important guidance on the rights and responsibilities of both the police and the public during investigations. It emphasizes the importance of cooperation and transparency in the justice system, while also providing important safeguards against harassment and abuse of power. While the petitioner's request for protection from harassment was not granted, the court's decision provides important clarity on the legal process and the rights of individuals during investigations.
