The Madras High Court recently heard multiple writ appeals related to the proposed poultry farm and feed mill to be set up in Kodanthur village by M/S.Supreme Poultry Private Limited. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had granted consent to establish the said industry, subject to certain conditions. However, the residents of nearby hamlets filed a suit for a declaration that the erection and running of the poultry farm would be an objectionable and actionable nuisance to the inhabitants of the area. The Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union cancelled the earlier resolution granting permission to the company, citing public health and pollution concerns. The company challenged this cancellation in W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010.

The court order pertains to a dispute between a company and the Panchayat Union Council regarding the establishment of a poultry farm and feed mill. The company had obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board and invested a significant amount of money in compliance with the conditions issued by the authorities. However, the Panchayat Union Council passed a resolution cancelling the permission granted earlier, citing concerns about public health and environmental pollution. The court set aside the cancellation, stating that the council had no authority to pass such a resolution as it fell within the domain of the Pollution Control Board. The court also directed the District Collector cum Inspector of Panchayats to hold an enquiry and pass appropriate orders after giving sufficient notice to the company and other relevant parties. The company challenged the order of the learned single Judge in dismissing the writ petitions, while the President of Village Panchayat filed an appeal in respect of the portion of the impugned order remitting the matter to the District Collector for reconsideration.

The court order discusses a dispute over the establishment of a poultry farm and feed mill. The company had obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board and other departments, but the local village panchayat withdrew its permission citing concerns over pollution and public health. The company challenged this decision, arguing that the panchayat had no jurisdiction over pollution control and that its consent was equivalent to that of the Panchayat Union Council. The court considered various provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act and related rules, as well as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Ultimately, the court upheld the panchayat's decision to withdraw permission and dismissed the company's appeals.

The court order discusses various rules and regulations related to building permissions and construction work in Tamil Nadu. It highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and giving opportunities for explanation before taking any action that may affect a person or company. The court dismisses some appeals and sets aside certain orders that were not in accordance with the rules. It also emphasizes that the Pollution Control Board, village panchayats, and other authorities must consider local implications before granting permissions or taking any action related to construction or pollution.

The court order states that decisions regarding pollution matters in a village panchayat or panchayat union council should only be made after following the principles of law and passing appropriate orders. The order of the District Collector is not valid until such orders are passed. The court also finds the order of the learned single Judge contradictory and sets it aside. The court allows some appeals and dismisses others, and directs the President of the Panchayat and the Inspector of Panchayats to act according to the provisions of the Rules and the Act after giving opportunity to the writ petitioner and the public.

In summary, the court order deals with a dispute over the establishment of a poultry farm and feed mill in Kodanthur village.
