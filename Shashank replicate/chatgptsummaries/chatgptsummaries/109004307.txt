In a recent court order, two accused individuals, Kumar Naika and Krishna Naika, were granted bail after being arrested for possession of dead black bucks in a reserve forest area. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the accused to execute a personal bond of Rs. 75,000 with one surety. Additionally, the accused were ordered to attend the police station once a week and refrain from engaging in any criminal activities or threatening prosecution witnesses.

The case in question involved the illegal possession of dead black bucks, which are a protected species under Indian law. The accused were arrested for their involvement in the possession of these animals, which were found in a reserve forest area. The court order pertains to a bail application filed by the accused, seeking release from custody while the case is ongoing.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the nature of the offense and the evidence against the accused. While the possession of dead black bucks is a serious offense, the court found that the evidence against the accused was not strong enough to warrant their continued detention. Additionally, the court took into account the fact that the accused had no prior criminal record and were not considered a flight risk.

As a condition of their bail, the accused were ordered to execute a personal bond of Rs. 75,000 with one surety. This means that they must provide a sum of money as security for their release, which will be forfeited if they fail to comply with the conditions of their bail. The surety is a person who agrees to take responsibility for the accused and ensure that they comply with the conditions of their bail.

In addition to the personal bond, the accused were also ordered to attend the police station once a week. This is a common condition of bail, as it allows the police to monitor the accused and ensure that they are not engaging in any criminal activities. The accused were also ordered to refrain from threatening prosecution witnesses or engaging in any other criminal activities while the case is ongoing.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the accused was based on a careful consideration of the evidence and the circumstances of the case. While the offense of possessing dead black bucks is a serious one, the court found that the evidence against the accused was not strong enough to justify their continued detention. The conditions of their bail, including the personal bond and weekly police check-ins, are designed to ensure that the accused comply with the law while the case is ongoing.
