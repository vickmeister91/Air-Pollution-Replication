The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The petitioner, V. Chinnasamy, had sought to set aside an order passed in Crl.M.P.No.1995 of 2015 in STC.No.159 of 2013 by the Fast Track Judge Magisterial Level in Erode and District. The petitioner was an accused in S.T.C.No.159 of 2013 for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, filed against him by the respondent/complainant, S. Dineshkumar.

The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for a direction to the respondent/complainant to produce the details of the R.C.Book and relating to the sale of the car. However, the trial court had dismissed the petition, and the petitioner had filed this petition seeking to set aside the order.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the criminal original petition, stating that there was no infirmity in the order impugned passed by the court below. This means that the trial court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's request for the production of documents was upheld by the higher court.

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had sought to use this section to challenge the trial court's decision to dismiss his request for the production of documents.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the offence of dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable for a criminal offence. The complainant in this case had filed a case against the petitioner under this section, alleging that a cheque issued by the petitioner had been dishonoured due to insufficient funds.

The petitioner had sought to obtain the details of the R.C.Book and relating to the sale of the car from the complainant. It is not clear from the court order why the petitioner needed these details, but it is possible that they were relevant to his defence in the case.

The trial court had dismissed the petitioner's request for the production of documents, and the petitioner had challenged this decision in the higher court. However, the higher court found no infirmity in the trial court's decision and dismissed the petitioner's petition.

Overall, this court order deals with a relatively straightforward issue of whether the petitioner's request for the production of documents should have been granted by the trial court. The higher court found that there was no reason to interfere with the trial court's decision, and therefore dismissed the petitioner's petition.
