The court order pertains to a suit filed by three minor plaintiffs through their maternal uncle as next friend to establish their title to a property and set aside an ex parte decree obtained by defendant 1 in a previous suit. The plaintiffs claimed that the property belonged exclusively to their father and defendant 1 had no right to it. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the special subordinate judge reversed the decision and decreed the suit. The defendant appealed, arguing that negligence on the part of the guardian ad litem was not sufficient grounds to set aside a decree obtained against a minor.

The court discussed the divergent opinions on this matter and ultimately held that gross negligence of the guardian ad litem would entitle an infant to obtain the avoidance of proceedings undertaken on their behalf. The court cited previous cases and concluded that the principle enunciated in those decisions applied to the present case.

The court order states that if a party has the right to set aside a decree on the grounds of fraud, Section 11 of the Civil P.C does not prevent them from doing so. Section 44 of the Evidence Act also does not prevent a party from avoiding a judgment by proving fraud or collusion. However, the case of a minor is treated as an exception to the rule, and they can set aside a decree on the grounds of gross and culpable negligence on the part of their guardian ad litem.

The court found that in this case, the guardian ad litem acted in a grossly negligent manner, resulting in serious loss of rights for the minors, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.
