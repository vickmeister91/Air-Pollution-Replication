The Kerala High Court recently issued a court order in response to a public interest litigation filed by an advocate regarding the issue of air pollution caused by automobiles in the state. The petitioner argued that the gaseous pollutants emitted by vehicles are highly harmful and hazardous to living creatures, particularly human beings. The court agreed with the petitioner's concerns and directed the state government to take necessary measures to address the issue.

One of the key directives issued by the court was for the state government to provide equipment to measure smoke density and other pollutants emitted by automobiles at major district centers within three months. This move is aimed at ensuring that the authorities have access to accurate data on the level of pollution caused by vehicles in different parts of the state. The court also directed the state government to issue instructions to all authorities in charge of registration of motor vehicles to comply with the legislative mandate contained in Section 20 of the Air Pollution Act.

The court's directive regarding Section 20 of the Air Pollution Act is significant as it requires all motor vehicles to comply with the prescribed emission standards. This includes both new and old vehicles, and failure to comply with the standards can result in penalties and fines. The court's order is aimed at ensuring that all vehicles on the road are compliant with the emission standards, which will help to reduce the level of pollution caused by automobiles in the state.

In addition to these directives, the court also directed the Director General of Police to issue necessary instructions to their subordinate officers to effectively carry out their functions envisaged in Rule 116 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. Rule 116 pertains to the inspection of motor vehicles by the authorities to ensure that they comply with the prescribed standards. The court's directive is aimed at ensuring that the authorities carry out their duties effectively and take necessary action against vehicles that do not comply with the standards.

Overall, the court's order is a significant step towards addressing the issue of air pollution caused by automobiles in Kerala. The directives issued by the court are aimed at ensuring that the authorities have access to accurate data on the level of pollution caused by vehicles, and that all vehicles on the road comply with the prescribed emission standards. The court's order is likely to have a positive impact on the environment and the health of the people in the state.
