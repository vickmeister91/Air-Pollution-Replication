The case centered around allegations that the accused had violated the Water (Prevention and Control) of Pollution Act, 1974. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a case against the accused, alleging that they had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby river, causing pollution and harm to the environment.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence to support their case, including witness testimony and laboratory reports. However, the defense argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
