In a recent court order, the court was asked to determine whether the deceased's share in the goodwill of two firms should be included in the estate value and whether a sum of money gifted by the deceased to his son should be included under the Estate Duty Act, 1953. The court found that the deceased's share in the goodwill of one firm should not be included, but the share in the other firm should be included. The sum of money gifted to the son was not included.

The case involved the estate of a deceased person who had shares in two firms. The first firm was a partnership firm, and the second was a private limited company. The deceased had gifted a sum of money to his son during his lifetime, and the question before the court was whether this sum should be included in the estate value.

The court first considered the issue of the deceased's share in the goodwill of the two firms. The court noted that the valuation of partnership assets is governed by the Partnership Act, 1932, and the valuation of company assets is governed by the Companies Act, 1956. The court also noted that the inclusion of goodwill in the estate value is governed by the Estate Duty Act, 1953.

The court found that the deceased's share in the goodwill of the partnership firm should not be included in the estate value. The court noted that the Partnership Act, 1932, provides that the goodwill of a partnership firm is not an asset that can be sold or transferred. The court also noted that the deceased's share in the partnership firm was not transferable and could not be sold. Therefore, the court held that the deceased's share in the goodwill of the partnership firm should not be included in the estate value.

However, the court found that the deceased's share in the goodwill of the private limited company should be included in the estate value. The court noted that the Companies Act, 1956, provides that the goodwill of a company is an asset that can be sold or transferred. The court also noted that the deceased's share in the private limited company was transferable and could be sold. Therefore, the court held that the deceased's share in the goodwill of the private limited company should be included in the estate value.

The court then considered the issue of the sum of money gifted by the deceased to his son. The court noted that the Estate Duty Act, 1953, provides that any property gifted by the deceased during his lifetime should be included in the estate value if the gift was made within two years of the deceased's death. However, the court found that the sum of money gifted by the deceased to his son was not made within two years of the deceased's death. Therefore, the court held that the sum of money gifted to the son should not be included in the estate value.

Finally, the court discussed the issue of costs. The parties were divided in their successes, so there was no order as to costs.

In conclusion, the court order provides clarity on the issue of the inclusion of goodwill in the estate value under the Estate Duty Act, 1953. The court held that the deceased's share in the goodwill of a partnership firm should not be included in the estate value, but the share in the goodwill of a private limited company should be included. The court also clarified that any property gifted by the deceased during his lifetime should be included in the estate value if the gift was made within two years of the deceased's death.
