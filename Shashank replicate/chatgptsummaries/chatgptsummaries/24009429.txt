In a recent court order, the first bail application of Mangal Sahu was dismissed. Sahu was accused of possessing 39.5 kilograms of Ganja, a banned substance in India. The defense argued that the police falsely implicated Sahu and demanded money from him. However, the court considered the quantity of Ganja seized and the fact that another case of similar nature was registered against Sahu and denied bail.

The case against Sahu was registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, which prohibits the production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transport, and consumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The act was enacted in 1985 to combat drug abuse and trafficking in India.

During the hearing, the defense argued that Sahu was falsely implicated in the case and that the police demanded money from him. They also argued that Sahu was a small-time farmer and could not have possessed such a large quantity of Ganja. However, the prosecution argued that Sahu was a repeat offender and that another case of similar nature was registered against him in the past.

The court considered the arguments of both the defense and the prosecution and observed that the quantity of Ganja seized was substantial. The court also noted that another case of similar nature was registered against Sahu in the past, which indicated that he was involved in the illegal trade of narcotics. The court, therefore, denied bail to Sahu.

The decision of the court is in line with the NDPS Act, which provides for stringent punishment for drug offenders. The act provides for a minimum punishment of 10 years and a maximum punishment of 20 years for offenses involving commercial quantities of drugs. The act also provides for the forfeiture of property derived from or used in the commission of drug offenses.

The court's decision sends a strong message to drug offenders and serves as a deterrent to others who may be involved in the illegal trade of narcotics. The NDPS Act has been successful in reducing drug abuse and trafficking in India, and the court's decision is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny bail to Mangal Sahu in the case of possessing 39.5 kilograms of Ganja is in line with the NDPS Act and serves as a deterrent to drug offenders. The court considered the quantity of Ganja seized and the fact that another case of similar nature was registered against Sahu and denied bail. The decision of the court is a step in the right direction towards reducing drug abuse and trafficking in India.
