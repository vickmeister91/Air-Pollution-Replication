The Bihar Saw Mill (Regulation) Act, 1990, governs the renewal of saw mill licenses in the state of Bihar. In a recent court order, the license renewal of a saw mill was in question. The respondents had not renewed the license on the grounds that the lease for the land on which the saw mill was situated had not been renewed by the lessor. The learned single Judge had dismissed the writ application on the grounds that the license could not be renewed without prior approval of the Central Government as per Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. However, the court found that Section 2 of the 1980 Act only applies to saw mills operating within forest areas and not to those operating outside of it.

The court order pertains to the interpretation of Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The section states that no state government shall make any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose without prior approval of the Central Government. The learned single Judge had interpreted this section to mean that the renewal of a saw mill license required prior approval of the Central Government. However, the court found that this interpretation was incorrect.

The court noted that the Bihar Saw Mill (Regulation) Act, 1990, does not require prior approval of the Central Government for the renewal of saw mill licenses. The Act only requires compliance with the conditions specified in the license and the rules made under the Act. The court also noted that Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, only applies to saw mills operating within forest areas. The court found that the saw mill in question was not operating within a forest area and therefore, Section 2 of the 1980 Act did not apply.

The court order has significant implications for the renewal of saw mill licenses in Bihar. The court has clarified that the renewal of saw mill licenses does not require prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. This will simplify the process of renewing saw mill licenses and reduce the burden on saw mill owners.

The court order also highlights the importance of interpreting laws correctly. The learned single Judge had interpreted Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to mean that the renewal of a saw mill license required prior approval of the Central Government. However, the court found that this interpretation was incorrect. The court's interpretation of the law will have far-reaching implications for the saw mill industry in Bihar.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to the renewal of a saw mill license under the Bihar Saw Mill (Regulation) Act, 1990. The court found that Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, only applies to saw mills operating within forest areas and not to those operating outside of it. Therefore, the court allowed the appeal and directed the respondents to reconsider the application for renewal of the license within three months. The court's interpretation of the law will simplify the process of renewing saw mill licenses and reduce the burden on saw mill owners.
