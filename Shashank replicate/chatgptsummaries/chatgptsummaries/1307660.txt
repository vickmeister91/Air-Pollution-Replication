A recent court order has been issued in relation to a dispute between the petitioners and the second respondent over a vehicle that the second respondent had entrusted to the petitioners for body building work. The petitioners have received a notice under Section 91 Cr.P.C to produce the vehicle before the learned Magistrate, but they have refused to do so, claiming a right of lien on the vehicle under civil law. The court has directed the learned Magistrate to permit the petitioners to raise their objections and consider appropriate directions after hearing both parties. The vehicle shall be kept in the custody of the petitioner until then.

The dispute between the petitioners and the second respondent arose when the second respondent entrusted a vehicle to the petitioners for body building work. The petitioners claim that they have a right of lien on the vehicle under civil law, which gives them the right to retain possession of the vehicle until they are paid for their services. However, the second respondent has demanded the return of the vehicle and has issued a notice under Section 91 Cr.P.C to produce the vehicle before the learned Magistrate.

The petitioners have refused to comply with the notice, claiming that they have a right of lien on the vehicle. The second respondent has filed a petition in court seeking the return of the vehicle, and the court has directed the learned Magistrate to permit the petitioners to raise their objections and consider appropriate directions after hearing both parties.

The court has recognized the petitioners' claim of a right of lien on the vehicle under civil law. The right of lien is a common law right that gives a person the right to retain possession of property until they are paid for their services. The court has directed the learned Magistrate to consider the petitioners' objections and to determine whether they have a valid claim of lien on the vehicle.

The court has also directed that the vehicle shall be kept in the custody of the petitioner until the matter is resolved. This means that the petitioners will retain possession of the vehicle until the learned Magistrate has made a determination on the matter.

The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the right of lien under civil law. The right of lien is an important legal principle that protects the interests of service providers who have not been paid for their services. The court's decision ensures that the petitioners are not unfairly deprived of their right to be paid for their services.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the dispute between the petitioners and the second respondent over a vehicle that the second respondent had entrusted to the petitioners for body building work has recognized the petitioners' claim of a right of lien on the vehicle under civil law. The court has directed the learned Magistrate to permit the petitioners to raise their objections and consider appropriate directions after hearing both parties. The vehicle shall be kept in the custody of the petitioner until then. The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the right of lien under civil law and ensures that the petitioners are not unfairly deprived of their right to be paid for their services.
