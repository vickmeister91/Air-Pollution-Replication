The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner is facing trial for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner had moved an application for the release of his seized vehicle and gun, which was rejected by the learned JMFC and subsequently by the Up Vanmandal Adhikari. The petitioner filed a criminal revision, which was also dismissed.

The court, however, allowed the release of the vehicle subject to certain conditions, but rejected the prayer for the release of the gun. The court held that until it is established that there is a violation of the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, the order of confiscation does not hold good.

The court directed the petitioner to produce the original registration, sale-letter, and insurance certificate of the vehicle and furnish a personal bond with one solvent surety. The petitioner was also directed not to transfer the ownership of the vehicle, not to lease it to anyone, and not to allow it to be used for any anti-social activities.
