The case in question involves a petitioner who had issued a cheque that was returned by HDFC Bank. The complainant filed a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques, and the petitioner filed an application to call the Manager of Union Bank of India for examination in defense. The trial court rejected the prayer, and the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order.

The petitioner's argument was that the Manager of Union Bank of India could provide evidence that the cheque was issued from the petitioner's account. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it was an attempt to delay the proceedings. The court also noted that it was the complainant's responsibility to prove that the cheque was issued by the petitioner and from the petitioner's account.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a provision that deals with the dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable for a criminal offence. The complainant in this case had filed a case under this provision, alleging that the petitioner had issued a cheque that was dishonoured by HDFC Bank.

The petitioner's defense was that the cheque was not issued by them, and that it was a case of mistaken identity. They had filed an application to call the Manager of Union Bank of India as a witness to prove that the cheque was not issued from their account. However, the trial court rejected this application, stating that it was not necessary to call the Manager of Union Bank of India as a witness.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order of the trial court. Section 482Cr.P.C. is a provision that allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of the court or to secure the ends of justice. The petitioner argued that the trial court's order was erroneous and that the Manager of Union Bank of India should be called as a witness.

However, the High Court dismissed the petition, stating that it was an attempt to delay the proceedings. The court noted that it was the complainant's responsibility to prove that the cheque was issued by the petitioner and from the petitioner's account. The court also observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their defense, and that calling the Manager of Union Bank of India as a witness would not be helpful in this regard.

In conclusion, the court order in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support one's defense in a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. It also emphasizes that the burden of proof lies with the complainant, and that the court will not allow attempts to delay the proceedings. The case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in such cases to present their arguments and evidence in a timely and efficient manner.
