The court order pertains to four different cases involving lease renewals and violations of lease conditions. The first case involves a writ appeal and two writ petitions filed by Shree Maruthi Marine Industries Ltd. seeking renewal of lease for land in Chengalpattu Taluk, Kancheepuram District, Tamil Nadu. The appeal and one of the writ petitions became infructuous, and the remaining writ petition was taken up for consideration. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined the facts of the case to decide on three points: whether the writ petition was maintainable, whether the petitioner was entitled to lease renewal, and whether the impugned order was liable to be set aside.

The court found that the writ petition was maintainable as the petitioner had a legitimate grievance against the impugned order. However, the court also found that there was no provision in the lease agreement or government orders that entitled the petitioner to automatic renewal. The court rejected the petitioner's claim of a violation of natural justice and found that the reasons given for rejecting the renewal were valid. The court ultimately denied the petitioner's request for renewal of the lease.

In the second case, the petitioner had requested a renewal of a lease for land used for salt manufacturing. The court found that the government's policy decision to protect the environment and extend the Chennai metropolitan area outweighed the petitioner's claim. The court also found that the petitioner's reliance on certain documents lacked credibility and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation did not apply. The court also held that the Transfer of Property Act did not apply to the case as the lease was granted under the Government Grants Act.

The third case involves a dispute over the renewal of a lease on agricultural land for the purpose of information technology development. The petitioner claimed automatic renewal of the lease, but the court found that the government's policy decision to protect the environment and extend the Chennai metropolitan area outweighed the petitioner's claim. The court also found that the petitioner's reliance on certain documents lacked credibility and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation did not apply. The court also held that the Transfer of Property Act did not apply to the case as the lease was granted under the Government Grants Act.

The fourth case involves two separate cases involving violations of lease conditions. In the first case, the appellant obtained a license to collect chank shells, but the government had the power to unilaterally terminate the arrangement without reason. The appellant was not entitled to damages. In the second case, the petitioner violated several lease conditions, including constructing small canals without permission, storing sea water in pans, and not remitting lease dues on time. The government was not obligated to renew the lease and had the right to reject it without giving a reason. The court dismissed all three petitions.

In summary, the court order dealt with four different cases involving lease renewals and violations of lease conditions. The court found that there was no provision in the lease agreement or government orders that entitled the petitioners to automatic renewal of their leases. The court also found that the government's policy decision to protect the environment and extend the Chennai metropolitan area outweighed the petitioners' claims in two of the cases. The court dismissed all three petitions in the fourth case as the petitioners had violated several lease conditions. The court's decisions were based on a careful examination of the facts of each case and the relevant laws and policies.
