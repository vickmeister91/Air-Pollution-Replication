In a public interest litigation case (No. 42 of 2009) filed by Dighi Koli Samaj Mumbai Rahivasi Sangh against the Union of India, State of Maharashtra, Maharashtra Maritime Board, Collector of Raigad, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Dighi Port Limited, and several individuals residing in different areas of Raigad district, the court order involves a petition filed by a registered body claiming to promote and safeguard the interests of villagers in Dighi, regarding the environmental clearance granted for the development of Dighi Port. The petition alleges non-compliance with statutory requirements, conditions not in the public interest, and violations of conditions by the respondents. The court heard the case and reserved judgment on June 11, 2009, and pronounced judgment on July 9, 2009.

The court order states that the respondents have violated conditions related to damaging the sand, reclaiming land from the sea, and providing proper water supply. This has resulted in the destruction of the environment and ecology of the area, which has disadvantaged the people living there. The petitioners are requesting that the clearance granted for the development project be set aside and the project be stopped immediately. The villagers in the area rely on agriculture and fishing for their livelihood, and the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act has been enforced to protect their interests. The land was acquired by the state for public purpose, but the petitioners claim that it was given to a private entrepreneur without following the prescribed procedure. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board granted clearance in a mechanical manner, and the authorities have violated the provisions of the Environment Act. The court order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The court order describes a dispute between a petitioner organization and respondent authorities over the development of a port in Dighi, India. The petitioner claims that the development violates constitutional rights and the doctrine of public trust, while the respondents argue that proper procedures were followed and the development is necessary for economic growth. The court is considering the arguments of both sides and reviewing evidence such as public hearing records and affidavits.

The court order appoints an amicus curiae to assist in a public interest litigation case against CIDCO and other respondents regarding the attempted disposal of developable land. The court frames four questions to determine the scope of the hearing, and the non-petitioners are given notice and opportunities to defend themselves. The court's findings are based on the records and factual inferences. The court asserts that technicalities do not deter it from wielding its power to do justice and uphold constitutional and democratic values. The court also references a previous case to discuss the scope of maintainability of a public interest litigation case.

The court order discusses the principle of public interest litigation and the need for caution when entertaining such petitions. The order cites various cases and emphasizes that only those who act bona fide and have sufficient interest in the matter can approach the court for relief. The court warns against the misuse of public interest litigation for personal gain or political motives and stresses the importance of using it as a tool for delivering social justice to citizens. The order also cites examples of vexatious petitions that deserve rejection at the threshold.

The court order warns of the potential for political pressure groups to use the courts to further their aims and emphasizes the need for the court to avoid overstepping its judicial function. It also discusses the importance of genuine public interest litigation and the need for litigants to come to court with true facts and clean hands. The court rejects objections to the maintainability of the petition and the plea of delay and latches, stating that the approach of the court in environmental matters should be somewhat liberal. The scope of judicial review in public interest litigation has also enlarged over time.

The court order concerns the regulation of green/open spaces in the redevelopment of mill lands in Mumbai. The court discusses the expanding scope of judicial review and the importance of enforcing laws to protect the environment. The petitioner alleges violations of the law by the respondents and the court asserts its duty to ensure the rule of law is maintained. The court cites previous cases to support its position.

The court order discusses the violation of anti-pollution laws and the adverse effects it has on the environment and future generations. The main argument in the case is about the reclaiming of land and sand hills for the construction and development of a port, which the petitioner claims is being done without the necessary permissions and is disturbing the ecological and aesthetic qualities of the area. However, the respondent argues that they have complied with the conditions and permissions granted by the concerned authorities. The court also discusses the mandatory requirement of public hearing for affected persons in granting environmental clearance for projects and activities.

The court order states that a public hearing must be conducted in a systematic, time-bound, and transparent manner to ensure the widest possible public participation before issuing environmental clearance. A proper body must be constituted for this purpose, and objections raised must be considered by the authorities. The court also notes that the public hearing should be granted at the site or nearby places in close proximity to enable affected persons to put forward their suggestions and objections. The court found that the public hearing for the Dighi Port project did not take place at the site or nearby areas but at the district headquarters, which is not proper compliance with the requirements. However, the court found that the panel constituted by the Ministry itself does not suffer from any legal infirmity.

The court order states that there was a lack of
