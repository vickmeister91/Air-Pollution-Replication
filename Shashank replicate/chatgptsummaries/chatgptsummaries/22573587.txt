The petitioner, Ajay Das, has been accused of possessing and transporting banned substances, as well as hunting and killing protected animals. The charges against him are serious and carry severe penalties.

In order to avoid arrest, the petitioner has filed for pre-arrest bail under Section 438 Cr.PC.

The court has further directed the petitioner not to make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case.

The court's decision to grant interim bail to the petitioner is based on the principle of presumption of innocence. This principle holds that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. The court has also taken into account the fact that the petitioner has no criminal antecedents and has cooperated with the investigation so far.

However, the court has also imposed certain conditions on the petitioner to ensure that he does not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.
