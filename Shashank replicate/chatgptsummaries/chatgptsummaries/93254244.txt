The Delhi High Court recently heard a case in which the petitioners sought to quash two complaint cases filed against them under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complaints were filed by M/s J.J. Jewellers for the dishonour of two cheques. The petitioners argued that they could not be held liable as the cheques were not issued by them or their company. The court held that vicarious liability can only be imposed on directors of a company if the company is also impleaded and the complaint clearly discloses their role in the commission of the offence.

The court order states that vicarious liability can only be imposed on directors of a company if the company itself is also accused and the complaint clearly discloses the role of the directors in the commission of the crime. The order cites a recent decision by the Apex Court and explains the legal requirements for vicarious liability under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court also distinguishes the present case from a previous case and concludes that the petitioners cannot be accused as they are not signatories to the dishonoured cheques and the complainant has not impleaded the company.

The court order further states that the accused are directors who were allegedly dealing with the complainant in the purchase of jewelry items. However, the complainant did not accuse them of dealing with the company that issued the dishonoured cheques. As a result, the court quashed the complaint cases against the present petitioners but allowed the complainant to prosecute the case against the company and the person who signed the cheques.

The court order clarifies that vicarious liability can only be imposed if the company itself is also accused and the complaint clearly discloses the role of the directors in the commission of the offence.
