In a recent court order, two individuals who were accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act by attempting to sell leopard skin had their bail application denied. The court stated that custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary for an effective investigation, and that the fact that other co-accused had been granted bail was not a ground for granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

The case involved two individuals who were caught attempting to sell leopard skin, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused had filed a bail application, seeking to be released from custody while the investigation was ongoing. However, the court denied the application, stating that custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary for an effective investigation.

The court noted that the accused had been caught in possession of leopard skin, which is a serious offense. The court also noted that the accused had not cooperated with the investigation, and that there was a possibility that they could tamper with evidence if they were released on bail.

The court further stated that the fact that other co-accused had been granted bail was not a ground for granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The court explained that each case is unique, and that the decision to grant bail is based on the specific circumstances of each case.

The court's decision to deny bail to the accused is in line with the Wild Life Protection Act, which is designed to protect endangered species from being hunted and killed for their skin, bones, and other body parts. The act imposes strict penalties on those who violate its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny bail to the accused in this case is a reminder that the Wild Life Protection Act is taken seriously by the courts, and that those who violate its provisions will be held accountable. The court's decision also underscores the importance of custodial interrogation in ensuring an effective investigation, and the need to prevent tampering with evidence.
