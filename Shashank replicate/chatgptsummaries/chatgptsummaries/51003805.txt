The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. by T. Mokanraj and others against the Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise. The petitioners are facing trial for an offence under the Customs Act, and they had filed an application to examine a retired Deputy Commissioner of Customs as a witness. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioners had not made out a prima facie case for the document they were seeking, and that the petition was filed only to protract the proceedings. The court directed the trial court to proceed with the trial and take appropriate action if the accused do not cooperate.

The case at hand involves a group of individuals who are facing trial for an offence under the Customs Act. The petitioners had filed an application to examine a retired Deputy Commissioner of Customs as a witness, but the court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners had not made out a prima facie case for the document they were seeking. The court also noted that the petition was filed only to protract the proceedings, which is a common tactic used by defendants to delay the trial.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition and direct the trial court to proceed with the trial is significant because it sends a message that the court will not tolerate attempts to delay or obstruct the judicial process. The court's decision also underscores the importance of making a prima facie case when seeking to examine a witness. In this case, the petitioners failed to do so, and as a result, their application was dismissed.

It is worth noting that the court's decision does not necessarily mean that the petitioners are guilty of the offence they are charged with. Rather, it simply means that the court has determined that their application to examine a witness was without merit and that the trial should proceed without further delay.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a reminder that the judicial process must be allowed to proceed without undue delay or obstruction. It is also a reminder of the importance of making a prima facie case when seeking to examine a witness. While the outcome of the trial remains to be seen, the court's decision in this case is an important step towards ensuring that justice is served in a timely and efficient manner.
