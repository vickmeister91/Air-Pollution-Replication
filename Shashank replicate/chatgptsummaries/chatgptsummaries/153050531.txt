The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mayavati against the State of Rajasthan and other respondents regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and impose damages or compensation on persons found contaminating the water. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to provide the status of a related case.

The court order requires the State and local authorities to provide an action report on the enforcement of compensation or damages. The court also requests the records of a previous case to be handed over before the next hearing. The order directs the removal of encroachments and structures causing contamination of canal water, and the State is directed to issue show cause notices to those causing pollution and to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. The compliance report is to be submitted by a specific date, and the Applicant is to be present during the inspection of the area.

The court order directs the Chief Engineer to inspect an area and remove any structures contributing to pollution or interfering with canal maintenance. The State Government is ordered to prepare a scheme for preventing untreated effluent discharge and removing encroachments on water bodies. The State Government is also directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to take immediate measures for removing encroachments. The court orders compliance reports to be filed and gives deadlines for removal of encroachments. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the State Authorities' actions should approach the NGT.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and how it does not bar writ jurisdiction. The court emphasizes the importance of fundamental and constitutional rights and the discretion given to High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue prerogative writs, orders, and directions to ensure enforcement, extension, and protection of these rights. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances in which this principle can be deviated from. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner(s) to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT is expected to possess ample power to condone the delay and entertain the application/representation.

The court has ordered that the NGT has the power to condone the delay in accepting applications/representations and should consider the delay caused by the pending writ petition. The petitioner(s) have requested that the NGT consider their application/representations sympathetically. The state is free to proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT after December 31, 2016. The stay petition has been disposed of.
