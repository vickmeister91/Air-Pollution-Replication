The court orders listed in this document pertain to various civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industry. The court heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.

One of the court orders discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the compensation provisions do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the cluster of mining leases has been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and only 70 lease holders are interested in the extension of the validity period of diversion.

Another court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner, one of the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur, has filed a writ petition praying for quashing of the demand notice and further direction to restrain the respondents from recovering NPV amount from the petitioner. The court has been presented with various arguments by the learned Additional Advocate General, including the fact that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire area of 281 hectares, and thus, approval was given on 07.02.2000 for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017. The court has also been informed that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been presented with various letters and guidelines related to the case.

The court order pertaining to the cluster area of 281 hectares of forest land in Udaipur found that the mining lease holders did not deserve any relief as they refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including their share in the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, houses, and dumping areas, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department in accordance with their policy letters.

Overall, these court orders highlight the ongoing disputes and controversies surrounding mining leases and forest clearances in the State of Rajasthan. The court has been presented with various arguments and evidence from both the petitioners and respondents, and has made decisions based on the specific circumstances of each case. It remains to be seen how these decisions will impact the mining and mineral industry in Rajasthan, as well as the conservation of forest land in the state.
