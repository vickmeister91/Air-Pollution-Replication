The court order in question pertains to two petitions filed by the accused in a criminal case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The first respondent had filed a miscellaneous petition to send for certain documents pertaining to an insolvency petition filed by a witness. The trial magistrate dismissed the petition, but the revisional court allowed it. The accused filed petitions to quash the orders passed by the revisional court.

The court held that the power under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code can only be exercised in cases of abuse of process of the court or where interference is absolutely necessary for securing the ends of justice. As the orders passed by the revisional court were of an interlocutory nature and could be corrected in exercise of revisional or appellate powers, the court refused to exercise its inherent power and dismissed the petitions.
