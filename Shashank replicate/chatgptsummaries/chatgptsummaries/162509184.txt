The court order pertains to the illegalities involved in the mining lease of Sarda Mines Private Limited (SMPL). The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) dealt with seven issues related to the mining lease, and the court is concerned with the validity of the environmental clearance granted to SMPL and the production of iron ore without/in excess of the environmental clearance. The court notes that SMPL was granted permission to extract iron ore in 1999, but it did not act upon it until the mining lease was renewed in 2001. The court also highlights that the environmental clearance granted to SMPL in 2004 referred to the "proposal for expansion of production of iron ore (lump)" from 1.5 LTPA to 4.0 MTPA, which was not in line with the permission granted in 1999 and the MMDR Act.

The court clarifies that the environmental clearance granted to SMPL was only for the extraction of mineral iron ore ROM and not iron ore (lump). The court also states that the environmental clearance cannot have retrospective effect and that any excess mining of iron ore by SMPL is illegal and must be penalized. The court orders the Central Empowered Committee to quantify the penalty to be imposed on SMPL. The court also refers to a chart presented by SMPL and notes that for the production of iron ore (lump), the total excavation of iron ore ROM proposed is almost double the quantity.

The court finds that the entire extraction of iron ore ROM must be considered for calculating excess or illegal production, and that SMPL's sale of iron ore ROM to Jindal Steel and Power Ltd. is relevant. The court rejects SMPL's objections to the report of the CEC and grants 6 weeks for the CEC to rework the quantum of excessive or illegal mining and the consequent penalty. The substantive applications are disposed of according to the above directions.

In summary, the court order deals with the illegalities involved in the mining lease of SMPL and the validity of the environmental clearance granted to them. The court notes that SMPL was granted permission to extract iron ore in 1999, but it did not act upon it until the mining lease was renewed in 2001. The court also highlights that the environmental clearance granted to SMPL in 2004 referred to the "proposal for expansion of production of iron ore (lump)" from 1.5 LTPA to 4.0 MTPA, which was not in line with the permission granted in 1999 and the MMDR Act.
