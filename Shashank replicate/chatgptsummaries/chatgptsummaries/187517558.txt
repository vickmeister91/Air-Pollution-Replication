The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Ghanshyam Dhurka, the Executive President of New India Sugar Mills Ltd. The case sought the quashing of an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Patna in 1988, which had taken cognizance of offences under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused for discharging trade effluents without consent.

Upon examination of the case, the court found that the treatment plant had been installed and was functioning, and that the accused persons were no longer alive. As a result, the court ordered the quashing of the proceedings on the deposit of Rs. 5,000 with the District Legal Services Authority, Samastipur.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and the consequences of failing to do so. The Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, was enacted to prevent and control water pollution and to maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water. The act requires industries to obtain consent from the State Pollution Control Board before discharging any effluent into water bodies. Failure to comply with the act can result in legal action, as seen in this case.

The court's decision to quash the proceedings on the deposit of Rs. 5,000 with the District Legal Services Authority, Samastipur, is significant. It indicates that the court recognized the efforts made by the accused to rectify the situation by installing a treatment plant. However, it also serves as a reminder that environmental regulations must be followed, and that legal action can be taken if they are not.

Overall, this court order serves as a cautionary tale for industries to ensure that they comply with environmental regulations. It also highlights the importance of taking corrective action if violations occur, as this can potentially mitigate the legal consequences.
