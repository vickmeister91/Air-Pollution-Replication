In July 2008, the High Court of Karnataka passed an order in an appeal filed by Majela Pharmaceutical against a lower court judgment. The lower court had acquitted the respondent of an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act). The appeal was heard by the High Court, and the order was passed on July 22, 2008.

The case pertains to a dispute between Majela Pharmaceutical and the respondent over a dishonored cheque. The respondent had issued a cheque to Majela Pharmaceutical, which was dishonored due to insufficient funds. Majela Pharmaceutical had then filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, which deals with the dishonor of cheques.

The lower court had acquitted the respondent, stating that the cheque was not issued for a debt or liability, but for the purchase of goods. The court had also held that the complainant had failed to prove that the cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds.

Majela Pharmaceutical had then filed an appeal against this judgment in the High Court of Karnataka. The High Court heard the appeal and passed an order on July 22, 2008. The court held that the lower court had erred in acquitting the respondent and set aside the judgment.

The High Court observed that the cheque was issued for a debt or liability, as the respondent had purchased goods from Majela Pharmaceutical. The court also held that the complainant had proved that the cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The court, therefore, convicted the respondent under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for a period of six months.

The court also directed the respondent to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000 to Majela Pharmaceutical. The court observed that the respondent had caused mental agony and financial loss to the complainant by issuing a dishonored cheque. The court, therefore, ordered the respondent to pay the fine as compensation to the complainant.

In conclusion, the High Court of Karnataka passed an order in July 2008 in an appeal filed by Majela Pharmaceutical against a lower court judgment. The court convicted the respondent under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for six months. The court also directed the respondent to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000 to Majela Pharmaceutical as compensation for the mental agony and financial loss caused by the dishonored cheque.
