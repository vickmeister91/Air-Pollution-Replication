In a recent court order, a bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C was rejected for the grant of bail in connection with Forest Crime No.1391/2011 registered at Police Station Forest Circle Bandol District Seoni (M.P.). The applicant had been in jail since 14.02.2015 and was charged with offences punishable under Sections 9, 39(A), 44(A) and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act.

The court carefully examined the case and found no grounds for granting bail to the applicant. The charges against the applicant were serious and related to the protection of wildlife, which is a matter of great importance. The court noted that the applicant had been in jail for a considerable period of time, but this alone was not sufficient to grant bail.

The court also considered the nature of the offences and the evidence against the applicant. The charges against the applicant were related to the illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife, which is a serious offence. The court found that the evidence against the applicant was strong and there was a likelihood that the applicant may tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses if released on bail.

The court also considered the impact of the applicant's release on the society and the environment. The court noted that the illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife has a detrimental effect on the environment and the ecosystem. The court found that the applicant's release may encourage others to engage in similar activities, which would have a negative impact on the environment and the wildlife.

In light of these factors, the court found no case for bail and rejected the application. The court emphasized the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment and stated that such offences cannot be taken lightly. The court also noted that the applicant had the right to apply for bail again if there were any changes in the circumstances of the case.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment. The court carefully examined the case and found no grounds for granting bail to the applicant. The court emphasized that such offences cannot be taken lightly and that the applicant had the right to apply for bail again if there were any changes in the circumstances of the case.
