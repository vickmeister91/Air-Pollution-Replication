The Indian judiciary has been known to be a strong proponent of the rule of law and the separation of powers. In recent court orders, the judiciary has reiterated its stance on these principles and has struck down attempts by the legislature and executive to overstep their boundaries.

One such case pertains to the State of Kerala's attempt to provide reservations for appointments in the state based on certain criteria. The court held that the law was unconstitutional and violative of the principles of separation of powers and Articles 14, 16(1) and 16(4) of the Constitution of India. The court emphasized that the legislature cannot refuse to accept the declaration of law made by the court and cannot declare anything to the contrary. The court further held that the legislature cannot set aside an individual decision inter-parties and affect their rights and liabilities alone. This decision reinforces the judiciary's role as the final arbiter of the law and the importance of upholding the Constitution.

In another case, the State of Kerala attempted to pass an ordinance and later a plenary legislation to remove encroachers from land, despite previous court orders directing the removal of encroachers. The court held that the State cannot set aside a judicial pronouncement through executive or legislative action, and that the legislative effort was invalid as it did not remove the basis of the court's previous orders. The court also noted that the State's attempt to remove encroachers disregarded the roles assigned to the three organs of the State under the Constitution. This decision highlights the importance of respecting the judiciary's decisions and the need for the executive and legislature to work within their constitutional limits.

In yet another case, the court declared that the State's decision to disregard a court order to evict encroachers from government land is a violation of the rule of law. The court declared a section of the Act providing for a stay of eviction as invalid and appreciated the efforts of the Amicus Curiae. The petitioner had filed a writ petition to evict encroachers from government land, and the court had given a final order to evict them. However, the State had proceeded to invoke its legislative power to stay the eviction, which the court finds to be unconstitutional. The court also notes that the State did not impugn the order before an appropriate forum. This decision reinforces the importance of following due process and respecting the judiciary's decisions.

Finally, in a case where land was assigned to landless persons under the Land Reforms Act or Land Assignment Act without considering encroachers, the government cancelled previous orders and an administrative order was issued to transfer the land to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The court found no reason to challenge the validity of the administrative order and dismissed the writ petition. This decision emphasizes the importance of following established procedures and respecting administrative decisions.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of upholding the rule of law and the separation of powers. The judiciary's role as the final arbiter of the law and the need for the executive and legislature to work within their constitutional limits have been reiterated. These decisions serve as a reminder to all organs of the State to respect the Constitution and the judiciary's decisions.
