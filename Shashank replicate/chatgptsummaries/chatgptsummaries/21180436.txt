The court order in question pertains to a case where a non-applicant filed an application for maintenance against the applicant under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). During the trial, the non-applicant filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. alleging that the applicant was hiding his income and requested the court to direct the applicant to produce his income tax returns of the last four years. The trial court allowed the application and directed the applicant to produce his income tax returns.

The applicant filed a revision against this order, stating that he was not an income tax payee and had not filed any income tax returns. The court found that the trial court had committed a mistake in directing the applicant to file income tax returns and set aside the order.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal provisions and procedures involved in a case. Section 125 of Cr.P.C. provides for the maintenance of wives, children, and parents, while Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order the production of documents or other material objects.

In this case, the non-applicant had alleged that the applicant was hiding his income and requested the court to direct the applicant to produce his income tax returns. The trial court allowed the application and directed the applicant to produce his income tax returns. However, the applicant filed a revision against this order, stating that he was not an income tax payee and had not filed any income tax returns.

The court found that the trial court had committed a mistake in directing the applicant to file income tax returns. The court noted that Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers the court to order the production of documents or other material objects, but only if they are necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court further noted that the non-applicant had not made out a case for the production of income tax returns and that the trial court had erred in directing the applicant to produce them.

The court's decision in this case underscores the importance of following the legal provisions and procedures involved in a case. It also highlights the need for parties to make out a case for the production of documents or other material objects before seeking an order from the court.

In conclusion, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the legal provisions and procedures involved in a case. It also emphasizes the need for parties to make out a case for the production of documents or other material objects before seeking an order from the court. Ultimately, adherence to these principles can help ensure that justice is served and that the legal system operates effectively and efficiently.
