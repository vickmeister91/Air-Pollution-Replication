In the first court order, Rittin Mehrotra was accused of possessing four live turtles specified in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 without any legal documents. The case was filed under section 55 of the Act. However, the accused was acquitted of the charges on 18 September 2013 due to lack of evidence. The court heard the arguments and examined the witnesses before passing the final order. The judgment provides a detailed account of the case, including the statements of the complainant and the accused, and the evidence presented by both parties.

Moving on to the second court order, it prohibits dealing in trophies, animal articles, and meat derived from scheduled animals. The case involves the prosecution of an accused who was allegedly selling live turtles. The defense counsel argued that the accused is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. There are material contradictions in the statements of prosecution witnesses, and the presence of witnesses at the spot appears to be doubtful. The raid and seizure of case property also appear to be doubtful, and the testimony of prosecution witnesses is not reliable.

In the third court order, the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There were contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses, and no independent public witness was joined in the case. The non-examination of decoy customers also resulted in a significant chain of missing facts and circumstances. The accused is acquitted of charges, and bail bonds are extended for six months. The case property, if any, will be confiscated to the state, and the file will be consigned to the record room.

In summary, all three court orders involve cases related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first case involved the possession of live turtles without legal documents, while the second case involved the selling of live turtles. In both cases, the defense counsel argued that the accused was innocent and had been falsely implicated. The third case involved the failure of the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, due to contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses and the non-examination of decoy customers. In all three cases, the accused was acquitted of charges.
