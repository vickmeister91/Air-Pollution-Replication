The Jharkhand High Court has recently issued several orders in various criminal cases. These orders include putting cases on hold until service reports are received, granting interim orders to continue until the next listing date, and allowing time for counter affidavits to be filed. In one case, the petitioner was asked to provide the correct address for the opposite party to be served with a notice. In another case, the court has stayed the proceedings until the next listing date.

In one of the cases, the court has adjourned the proceedings until November 27, 2014. This is a criminal case, and the reason for the adjournment is not clear from the available information. In another case, the court has issued a notice to the opposite party in a transfer petition for a matrimonial case. The third case is a petition to quash a criminal proceeding, and the court has adjourned the case until November 20, 2014. The fourth order is incomplete and does not provide any information about the case.

In a separate case, the petitioner has filed an interlocutory application seeking an amendment in para 1 and prayer portion of the main petition. The court has allowed the application and ordered necessary amendments to be carried out. The case has been put up for the next day.

Overall, these court orders reflect the routine proceedings of the Jharkhand High Court in criminal cases.
