The case against the accused is a serious one, as it involves offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Wild Life Protection Act, and Arms Act. The accused are alleged to have gone on a hunting trip, during which one of them fired a gun shot that resulted in the death of a person who was behind the bush. The prosecution has presented evidence to support their case, and the court has taken this evidence into consideration.

However, the court has also considered the fact that the accused have been in custody for a considerable period of time, and that they have not been convicted of any offence. The court has also taken into account the fact that the accused have no previous criminal record, and that they have cooperated with the investigation.

Based on these factors, the court has allowed the application for bail. The court has directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one solvent surety in the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the accused will be released from custody, but they will have to provide a personal bond and a surety to ensure that they will appear in court when required.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is a balanced one. The court has taken into account the seriousness of the offences alleged against the accused, as well as their personal circumstances. The court has allowed the application for bail, but has also imposed conditions to ensure that the accused will appear in court when required.
