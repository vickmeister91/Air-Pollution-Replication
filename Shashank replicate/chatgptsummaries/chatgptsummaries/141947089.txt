Two court orders have been issued in Delhi regarding disputes over the use of public parks. The first case involves the Senior Citizen Council of Delhi and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) over the use of a shed in Deer Park. The council had been using the shed for morning activities since 1979, and the DDA had allowed them to do so for over three decades. However, in 1995-96, the DDA leased out the restaurant building next to the shed to Park Baluchi, and in 2012, the DDA disconnected the electricity supply to the shed and prevented the council from using it. The council filed a writ petition to restore the electricity supply, water supply, use of toilets, and access to the store room. The DDA rejected the representation of the council and ordered them to stop the prohibited activities in the protected forest and enclosure of Deer Park. The High Court dismissed the writ petition and directed the DDA to treat it as a representation and dispose of it within four weeks.

The second case involves a dispute between the DDA and an appellant society over the use of a park. The society had been using a rain shelter in the park for various activities, including satsang and meetings, for several years. The DDA had issued a communication in 2012 clarifying that the society could continue to use the shelter for routine activities like yoga and satsang, but not for commercial or religious activities. The society sought permission to use a store room in the park to store their equipment, but the DDA refused. The court dismissed the society's appeal, stating that public parks cannot be appropriated for exclusive use by any individual or group, and that the society's activities were in violation of a previous court order prohibiting the use of the park for religious, cultural, or commercial activities.

In both cases, the courts have ruled in favor of the DDA and upheld the principle that public parks cannot be appropriated for exclusive use by any individual or group. The Senior Citizen Council of Delhi had been using the shed in Deer Park for over three decades, but the DDA's decision to lease out the restaurant building next to the shed and disconnect the electricity supply to the shed prevented the council from continuing to use it. The council filed a writ petition to restore the electricity supply, water supply, use of toilets, and access to the store room, but the High Court dismissed the petition and directed the DDA to treat it as a representation and dispose of it within four weeks.

Similarly, the appellant society had been using a rain shelter in a public park for several years, but the DDA had issued a communication in 2012 clarifying that the society could only use the shelter for routine activities like yoga and satsang, not for commercial or religious activities. The society sought permission to use a store room in the park to store their equipment, but the DDA refused. The court dismissed the society's appeal, stating that public parks cannot be appropriated for exclusive use by any individual or group, and that the society's activities were in violation of a previous court order prohibiting the use of the park for religious, cultural, or commercial activities.

These court orders highlight the importance of preserving public parks for the use of all citizens, rather than allowing them to be appropriated for exclusive use by any individual or group. While the Senior Citizen Council of Delhi and the appellant society may have had legitimate reasons for wanting to use the shed and rain shelter, respectively, the courts have ruled that their activities were in violation of previous court orders and the principle of public access to parks. The DDA has a responsibility to ensure that public parks are accessible to all citizens, and to prevent any individual or group from appropriating them for exclusive use.
