The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the issue of whether the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) is entitled to charge service fees for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The first court order involves writ appeals filed by the Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Block's Manufacturers Association and two other parties against an order made in W.P.No.12295 of 2011, dated 13.06.2013, wherein the writ petition filed by TANGEDCO was allowed and the Office Memorandum dated 18.03.2011 issued by the fourth respondent was set aside. The appellants are Brick Manufacturers who receive fly ash free of charge from various thermal power plants in the state, as per the notification issued by the Union of India. TANGEDCO, representing the Thermal Power Plants, filed the Writ Petition, which was allowed by the learned Single Judge. The writ appeals were filed against this decision.

The court refers to a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, which mandates that coal or lignite-based thermal power plants must supply fly ash to brick manufacturers free of cost for at least ten years. The court notes that the notification was accepted by all parties concerned, including TANGEDCO, and was never challenged before the court. The court also refers to a previous order passed by the Division Bench of the court, which directed TANGEDCO to implement the notification in its letter and spirit and supply 20% of dry ESP fly ash free of charge to units manufacturing fly ash or clay fly ash bricks, blocks, and tiles on a priority basis over other users. The court concludes that TANGEDCO is not entitled to collect any amount under the guise of service charge as per the notification and directs the respondents to implement the notification in its letter and spirit.

The second court order pertains to the collection of service charges by respondents 2 to 7 from members of the Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Blocks Manufacturers' Association for lifting dry ESP fly ash to their respective bricks manufacturing units. The appellant association contended that the collection of service charges at Rs.100/- per metric tonne is contrary to the terms of the Notification issued by the Government of India, which made it mandatory for the use of 50% of dry fly ash in the manufacture of clay bricks, tiles or blocks for all the manufacturers. The court directed respondents 2 to 7 to approach the Union of India for approval for collection of service charges and for the Union of India to consider and dispose of the same on merits and in accordance with the law. The court also made it clear that if a decision is taken against the respondents, the amount collected should be refunded. The Union of India denied permission to collect service charges and directed the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to arrange for refund of the service charges collected from November 3, 2009, and to continue supply of fly ash to the manufacturers as per the Notification. The court held that the present writ petition filed by TANGEDCO is barred by principles of estoppel by conduct and res judicata.

The third court order discusses the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and its power to issue directions to any person, officer or authority, which must be complied with. The court also compares the Electricity Act, 2003 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, stating that they operate in different fields with different objectives. The court concludes that TANGEDCO is bound to follow the directions issued by the Union of India, which prohibit the collection of any charge for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The TANGEDCO cannot pass on the expenses of collecting fly ash to consumers of electricity.

The fourth court order states that TANGEDCO cannot pass on the expenses of collecting fly ash to the consumer of electricity. This expenditure is incurred to prevent atmospheric pollution and is mandatory for TANGEDCO to comply with the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court also mentions that previous orders have been passed on this matter, and the order of the learned Single Judge allowing the writ petition cannot be sustained. The court allows all the writ appeals and upholds the proceedings issued by the Union of India, Ministry of Environment and Forest. No costs are awarded, and the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the issue of whether TANGEDCO is entitled to charge service fees for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The court refers to a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, which mandates that coal or lignite-based thermal power plants must supply fly ash to brick manufacturers free of cost for at least ten years. The court concludes that TANGEDCO is not entitled to collect any amount under the guise of service charge as per the notification and directs the respondents to implement the notification in its letter and spirit. The court also directs respondents to approach the Union of India for approval for collection of service charges and for the Union of India to consider and dispose of the same on merits and in accordance with the law. The court upholds the proceedings issued by the Union of India, Ministry of Environment and Forest, and prohibits TANGEDCO from passing on the expenses of collecting fly ash to consumers of electricity.
