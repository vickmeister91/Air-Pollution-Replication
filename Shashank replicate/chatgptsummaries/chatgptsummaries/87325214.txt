The court has recently admitted a criminal revision case involving Anar Singh and The State of Madhya Pradesh. The case pertains to the conviction of Anar Singh under Section 51(1) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The lower courts had sentenced him to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000/-. The applicant's counsel has requested the suspension of the custodial sentence during the pendency of the criminal revision, which has been allowed by the court on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/-.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. Section 51(1) of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act. The section provides for imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with a fine, or with both.

In the present case, Anar Singh was convicted under Section 51(1) of the Act for hunting a wild boar. The lower courts had found him guilty of the offence and had sentenced him to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000/-. However, the applicant's counsel has challenged the conviction and sentence in the criminal revision case.

The court has now admitted the criminal revision case and has ordered the record of both lower courts to be requisitioned. This means that the court will examine the records of the lower courts to determine whether there were any errors or irregularities in the proceedings. The court will also examine the evidence on record to determine whether the conviction and sentence were justified.

During the pendency of the criminal revision, the applicant's counsel has requested the suspension of the custodial sentence. The court has allowed the request on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/-. This means that Anar Singh will not have to serve the one-year rigorous imprisonment sentence during the pendency of the criminal revision. However, he will have to pay the fine of Rs. 2000/-.

The court has listed the case for final hearing in due course. This means that the court will hear the arguments of both parties and will give a final decision on the matter. The court may either uphold the conviction and sentence or may set it aside and acquit the accused.

In conclusion, the court has admitted a criminal revision case involving Anar Singh and The State of Madhya Pradesh. The case pertains to the conviction of Anar Singh under Section 51(1) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The court has ordered the record of both lower courts to be requisitioned and has allowed the suspension of the custodial sentence during the pendency of the criminal revision on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/-. The case has been listed for final hearing in due course.
