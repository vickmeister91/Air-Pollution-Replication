The Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Pramod Yadav in connection with a case registered against him for illegally lifting sand from a river without a valid challan. The petitioner, who is the owner-cum-driver of the tractor, has no criminal antecedents. The court has ordered his release on bail upon arrest or surrender within six weeks, subject to certain conditions. If the petitioner is found involved in similar cases after release, the court may cancel his bail.

The case against Pramod Yadav was registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The petitioner was accused of illegally lifting sand from a river without a valid challan. The police had seized the tractor and sand from the petitioner's possession.

Pramod Yadav had approached the Patna High Court seeking anticipatory bail in the case. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. The counsel further submitted that the petitioner was the owner-cum-driver of the tractor and had no criminal antecedents. The counsel also submitted that the petitioner was ready to cooperate with the investigation and would abide by any conditions imposed by the court.

The prosecution opposed the grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The prosecution argued that the petitioner was involved in illegal sand mining and had violated the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The prosecution further argued that the petitioner was likely to tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses if released on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the Patna High Court granted anticipatory bail to Pramod Yadav. The court observed that the petitioner was the owner-cum-driver of the tractor and had no criminal antecedents. The court further observed that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had undertaken to abide by any conditions imposed by the court. The court also noted that the petitioner had surrendered the tractor and sand to the police.

The court imposed certain conditions while granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner was directed to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the investigating officer as and when required. The petitioner was also directed not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission. The petitioner was further directed to furnish a personal bond and surety bond of Rs. 50,000 each.

The court ordered the release of the petitioner on bail upon arrest or surrender within six weeks. The court also warned the petitioner that if he was found involved in similar cases after release, the court may cancel his bail.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted anticipatory bail to Pramod Yadav in connection with a case registered against him for illegally lifting sand from a river without a valid challan. The court has ordered his release on bail upon arrest or surrender within six weeks, subject to certain conditions. The court has also warned the petitioner that if he is found involved in similar cases after release, the court may cancel his bail.
