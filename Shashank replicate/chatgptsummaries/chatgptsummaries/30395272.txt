In a recent case, Mr. Prakash Padukone and his family members filed a writ petition against the State of Karnataka and IDBI Bank for freezing their bank account without any evidence linking them to the alleged offenses committed by Vikram Investment Company. The police had directed the bank to freeze the account based on a complaint filed by Mr. P.R. Balaji against the company. The court ordered the account to be de-frozen provided Mr. Padukone submits a bond of Rs. 20,00,000 before the Sessions Judge. The court stated that unless there is strong suspicion against the petitioners, the police cannot justify freezing their account as it affects their right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
