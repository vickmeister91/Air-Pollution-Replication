On November 26, 2019, the court heard the case with the reference number CWP/2067/2019. The petitioners/state were represented by the Advocate General and other representatives, while representatives for the respondents were also present, except for respondent No.1 who did not appear. The court noted that the question of jurisdiction under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was involved in the case.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. Section 22 of the Act deals with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and states that the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved.

In the case at hand, it appears that the court was considering whether the National Green Tribunal had jurisdiction over the matter. The court did not provide any details about the nature of the case or the parties involved, but it is likely that the case related to environmental protection or conservation of natural resources.

After hearing the matter, the court listed the case for further hearing at the admission stage on December 24, 2019. It is unclear from the court order what will happen at the admission stage, but it is likely that the court will consider whether to admit the case for further hearing or dismiss it.

Overall, the court order provides limited information about the case and the issues involved. It is unclear why respondent No.1 did not appear and what the specific question of jurisdiction under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was. However, the order suggests that the case is related to environmental protection or conservation of natural resources and that the court will consider the question of jurisdiction at the admission stage on December 24, 2019.
