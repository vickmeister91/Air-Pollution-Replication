The court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Mr. P.R. Chandran against an order passed by the trial judge in a criminal case. The complainant had filed an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking to recall a witness and mark two documents. The trial judge allowed the application, but the revision petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that the complainant had already had an opportunity to present the evidence and that the documents should have been filed earlier.

The court, after hearing both sides, agreed with the revision petitioner and set aside the trial judge's order. The court held that the complainant had already been given an opportunity to present the evidence and that the documents should have been filed earlier. The court also noted that the trial had been going on for a long time and that it needed to be expedited.

The court directed the trial to be expedited and completed within one month. This was done in order to ensure that justice was not delayed and that the trial was completed as soon as possible. The court also noted that the complainant had not shown any good reason for recalling the witness and marking the documents at this stage of the trial.

The court's decision was based on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. The court noted that the trial had been going on for a long time and that it needed to be completed as soon as possible. The court also noted that the complainant had already had an opportunity to present the evidence and that the documents should have been filed earlier.

The court's decision was also based on the principle that the trial judge should exercise his discretion judiciously. The court noted that the trial judge had allowed the application without considering the fact that the complainant had already had an opportunity to present the evidence and that the documents should have been filed earlier.

The court's decision was a reminder to all parties involved in a trial that they should present their evidence in a timely manner and that they should not seek to delay the trial unnecessarily. The court's decision was also a reminder to trial judges that they should exercise their discretion judiciously and that they should not allow applications that are not supported by good reasons.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the principles of justice and fairness. The court's decision was a reminder to all parties involved in a trial that they should present their evidence in a timely manner and that they should not seek to delay the trial unnecessarily. The court's decision was also a reminder to trial judges that they should exercise their discretion judiciously and that they should not allow applications that are not supported by good reasons.
