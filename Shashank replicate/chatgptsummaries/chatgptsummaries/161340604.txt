The Delhi High Court recently issued two court orders in relation to environmental violations. The first order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by M/S Kishan Chand Chaina Ram against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The committee had filed a complaint against the revisionist for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The revisionist challenged the order to frame charges against them, claiming there was no evidence and the inspection report was forged. However, the court found that there were specific allegations against the revisionist and the defense was a triable question to be decided during the course of evidence. The court upheld the impugned order.

The second order pertains to a manufacturing unit of sweets and namkeen that was found to be operating without an effluent treatment plant installed. The accused persons had filed a revision petition, relying on a notification that was issued after the date of inspection. However, the court found that the notification did not declare previous inspections to be invalid and that there was a prima facie case against the accused persons. The revision petition was dismissed, and the parties were directed to appear before the trial court on a specific date. The trial court record was sent back to the trial court with a copy of the order, and the file of revision was consigned to the record room.

These court orders highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the consequences of non-compliance. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution. The act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels and lays down the standards for the quality of water to be maintained in various water bodies. Violations of the act can result in criminal charges and penalties.

In the first court order, the revisionist had challenged the order to frame charges against them, claiming that there was no evidence and the inspection report was forged. However, the court found that there were specific allegations against the revisionist and that the defense was a triable question to be decided during the course of evidence. This highlights the importance of having proper evidence and documentation to support claims and defenses in court.

In the second court order, the accused persons had filed a revision petition, relying on a notification that was issued after the date of inspection. However, the court found that the notification did not declare previous inspections to be invalid and that there was a prima facie case against the accused persons. This highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of notifications and regulations and ensuring compliance with them.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of environmental compliance and the consequences of non-compliance. It is crucial for individuals and businesses to understand and comply with environmental regulations to ensure the protection of the environment and avoid legal repercussions.
