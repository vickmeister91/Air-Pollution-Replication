Three court orders related to wildlife protection have been summarized. The first order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by a Wildlife Inspector against the acquittal of three accused persons who were found carrying banned wildlife. The appellant argued that the evidence clearly showed the accused's involvement and that the confession statement was recorded by the complainant. However, the trial court concluded that the complainant was not a competent person. The court analyzed the evidence and found that the authorities did not follow proper procedure in seizing the contraband and implicating the accused. The court cited relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and ultimately found the accused guilty.

The second court order discusses a case where contraband was seized from the accused, but the trial court acquitted them on the grounds that the complainant was not competent to file a complaint. The investigating officer had the power to file a complaint under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, but the trial court did not consider this. The defense argued that the contraband was arranged to implicate the accused, and that the trial court's decision was not perverse. The court analyzed the evidence and found that the authorities did not follow proper procedure in seizing the contraband and implicating the accused. The court cited relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and ultimately found the accused guilty.

The third court order states that the seizure of Sea Cucumber made without following the procedure under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and without seizure of Sea Cucumber is not legally sustainable. The order of acquittal need not be interfered with unless there is a procedural irregularity or material evidence has been overlooked or misread by the subordinate court. The prosecution has not proved the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt, and thus the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt. The criminal appeal is dismissed, and the judgment passed in C.C.No.2649 of 2005 is confirmed.

In all three cases, the courts analyzed the evidence and found that the authorities did not follow proper procedure in seizing the contraband and implicating the accused. The courts cited relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and ultimately found the accused guilty. The courts also emphasized the importance of following proper procedure in such cases and ensuring that the prosecution proves the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.

The first court order highlights the importance of competent persons filing complaints and following proper procedure in such cases. The second court order emphasizes the need for investigating officers to file complaints under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and for the trial court to consider this. The third court order stresses the importance of following proper procedure in seizing contraband and ensuring that the prosecution proves the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of wildlife protection and the need to follow proper procedure in such cases. They also highlight the role of competent persons and investigating officers in filing complaints and ensuring that the prosecution proves the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.
