The court has granted bail to Ashok Ramtekkar, who had been in custody since February 4, 2018, in connection with a wildlife protection case. The prosecution had alleged that Ramtekkar was found in possession of the skull and body parts of a protected wild animal, Pangolin, which he was carrying on his motorcycle. Ramtekkar had claimed that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated.

The court allowed Ramtekkar's bail application and directed him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 with one surety of the same amount. The court's decision to grant bail to Ramtekkar was based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence against him, and his personal circumstances.

The court considered the nature of the offense in determining whether to grant bail to Ramtekkar. The offense of possessing the body parts of a protected animal is a serious offense, and the court recognized the importance of protecting wildlife. However, the court also recognized that Ramtekkar had not been convicted of the offense and was entitled to the presumption of innocence.

The court also considered the evidence against Ramtekkar in determining whether to grant bail. The prosecution had alleged that Ramtekkar was found in possession of the body parts of a Pangolin, but Ramtekkar had denied the allegations and claimed that he was innocent. The court recognized that the evidence against Ramtekkar was not conclusive and that there was a possibility that he may be acquitted at trial.

Finally, the court considered Ramtekkar's personal circumstances in determining whether to grant bail. Ramtekkar had been in custody for several months, and the court recognized that his continued detention would cause him and his family significant hardship. The court also recognized that Ramtekkar had no prior criminal record and was not a flight risk.

In light of these factors, the court granted bail to Ramtekkar. The court directed him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 40,000 with one surety of the same amount. The court also imposed certain conditions on Ramtekkar, including that he must not leave the jurisdiction without the court's permission and that he must cooperate with the investigation.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Ashok Ramtekkar was based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence against him, and his personal circumstances. The court recognized the importance of protecting wildlife but also recognized Ramtekkar's right to the presumption of innocence and his personal circumstances. The court's decision to grant bail was a balanced and fair decision that took into account all relevant factors.
