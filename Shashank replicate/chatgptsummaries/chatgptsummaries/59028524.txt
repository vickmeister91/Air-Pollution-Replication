In a recent court order, a revision against an order passed by a Special Sessions Judge under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 Singrauli in Special Case ATR No.18/2017 was dismissed. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking CCTV footage of the Waidhan Police Station and the mobile call details of the investigating officer and the witnesses, which did not relate to the case. The court endorsed the observations made by the learned Special Judge and dismissed the petition.

The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is a law enacted by the Indian Parliament to prevent atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Act provides for the punishment of offences such as atrocities, intimidation, and humiliation of members of these communities. The Act also provides for the establishment of special courts to try cases under the Act.

In the present case, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking CCTV footage of the Waidhan Police Station and the mobile call details of the investigating officer and the witnesses. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the documents or things sought must be relevant to the case.

The court observed that the documents sought by the petitioner were not relevant to the case and were sought only to harass the investigating officer and the witnesses. The court endorsed the observations made by the learned Special Judge and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the principle that documents or things sought under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. must be relevant to the case. The court's decision also sends a message that the Act is a serious law that must be enforced to prevent atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the fight against atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The court's decision upholds the principle that documents or things sought under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. must be relevant to the case and sends a message that the Act is a serious law that must be enforced to prevent atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
