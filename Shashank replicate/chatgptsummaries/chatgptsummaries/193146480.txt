The court order pertains to an application filed by Kadri Enterprise seeking a direction to the Assistant Commissioner of Customs to permit the provisional clearance of import of old and used tyres. The Customs Department had rejected the applicant's request for assessment of Bills of Entry on the ground that the Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued an Office Memorandum directing that old and used tyres for direct use should be treated as "prohibited goods" instead of "restricted goods". The applicant argued that the import of used pneumatic tyres is permissible under the restricted or free category under the EXIM policy, and the customs authorities cannot refuse assessment and clearance of such goods on the ground of an office memorandum. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order states that the import of used tires for reuse is permissible under certain circumstances, and an office memorandum cannot prohibit the import of second-hand tires. The Ministry of Environment and Forests argues that used tires for reuse fall under Schedule III Part-B of the rules and are regulated for import/export, and the applicant must obtain permission from the Ministry for import. The court notes that the goods imported are used pneumatic tires fit for reuse, not waste pneumatic tires, and that waste pneumatic tires are covered under a different category. The court concludes that the import in question is permissible.

The court order states that waste pneumatic tires do not fall under the category of hazardous waste if they are intended for certain operations. The import of used pneumatic tires for reuse in tractor trolleys and animal-driven carts does not fall under the definition of hazardous waste, and therefore, the rules for hazardous waste management do not apply. The court finds that an office memorandum prohibiting the import of such tires is not enforceable in law. The court grants interim relief to the applicant and directs the customs authorities to permit assessment and clearance of the imported goods subject to certain conditions. The rule is made absolute with no order as to costs.
