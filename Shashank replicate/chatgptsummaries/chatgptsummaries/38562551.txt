The Bombay Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the Indian state of Maharashtra. In a recent criminal case, four applicants were charged with violating this act. The applicants had previously filed for regular bail, but their application could not be heard. They have now filed for temporary bail due to an occasion of marriage.

The court has allowed temporary bail for one of the applicants, Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria, for a period of 10 days. However, the application has been rejected for the other three applicants. The court has imposed certain conditions on Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria for his temporary release. He must execute a personal bond and maintain law and order during his release.

The court's decision to grant temporary bail to Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria is based on the fact that he has an occasion of marriage. The court has taken into consideration the fact that marriage is a significant event in a person's life and that it is important for family members to be present during such an occasion. The court has also considered the fact that Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria has not been convicted of any crime and that he has a right to be released on bail.

However, the court has rejected the application for temporary bail for the other three applicants. The court has not provided any specific reasons for this decision. It is possible that the court has considered the nature of the crime and the evidence against the other three applicants before making this decision.

The court's decision to impose certain conditions on Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria's temporary release is also significant. The court has required him to execute a personal bond, which means that he must provide a financial guarantee that he will comply with the conditions of his release. This is a common condition imposed by courts when granting bail. The court has also required Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria to maintain law and order during his release. This means that he must not engage in any criminal activity or disturb the peace during his temporary release.

In conclusion, the court has granted temporary bail to one of the applicants in a criminal case involving the violation of the Bombay Prohibition Act. The court has allowed Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria to be released for a period of 10 days on the condition of executing a personal bond and maintaining law and order. The court has rejected the application for temporary bail for the other three applicants. The court's decision to grant temporary bail to Dilipbhai Kanjibhai Baria is based on the fact that he has an occasion of marriage and that he has not been convicted of any crime. The court's decision to impose certain conditions on his temporary release is also significant as it ensures that he complies with the conditions of his release and does not engage in any criminal activity during his temporary release.
