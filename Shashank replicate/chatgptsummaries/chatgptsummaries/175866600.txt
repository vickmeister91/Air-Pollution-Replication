The Indian judiciary has been actively involved in addressing the issue of illegal and unauthorized constructions of buildings and other structures in the country. Two recent court orders highlight the importance of planned development and the need for public authorities to impose adequate penalties on wrongdoers who violate relevant laws, master plans, zoning plans, and building regulations.

The first court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by H.L. Mittal and Indian Society for Educational Innovation against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners sought relief from the general notice issued for the demolition of structures for widening the road up to 40 feet as sanctioned in the map by the JDA. The court found that the width of the road was not determined in previous proceedings, but since the JDA had sanctioned a 40 feet wide road in 1988, it was required to be maintained. The court dismissed the petitions and allowed the demolition of encroachments on the road.

The second court order states that illegal and unauthorized constructions of buildings and other structures have become a major problem in India, and the court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of planned development of cities. The court ruled that the disputed construction in this case was in clear violation of the sanctioned plan and notices issued by the competent authority of the Corporation, and the application was made after completion of the construction. The court ordered the respondent to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction under a bonafide belief that the building was constructed as per the sanctioned plan. The court also emphasized the importance of planned development and the need for public authorities to impose adequate penalties on wrongdoers who violate relevant laws, master plans, zoning plans, and building regulations. The court warned that the support of the State apparatus for illegal and unauthorized constructions must stop, or even rural areas of the country will soon witness similar chaotic conditions.

The issue of illegal and unauthorized constructions has been a major problem in India for several years. The lack of proper planning and regulation has led to the mushrooming of unauthorized constructions in various parts of the country. These constructions not only pose a threat to the safety of the occupants but also cause environmental degradation and affect the overall aesthetics of the area.

The first court order highlights the importance of maintaining the sanctioned plans and regulations. The court found that since the JDA had sanctioned a 40 feet wide road in 1988, it was required to be maintained. The court dismissed the petitions and allowed the demolition of encroachments on the road. This decision sends a strong message to the public authorities that they must adhere to the sanctioned plans and regulations and take necessary steps to ensure their implementation.

The second court order emphasizes the need for planned development and the importance of imposing adequate penalties on wrongdoers who violate relevant laws, master plans, zoning plans, and building regulations. The court ruled that the disputed construction in this case was in clear violation of the sanctioned plan and notices issued by the competent authority of the Corporation. The court ordered the respondent to compensate those who purchased portions of unauthorized construction under a bonafide belief that the building was constructed as per the sanctioned plan. This decision not only provides relief to the affected parties but also sends a strong message to the wrongdoers that they will be held accountable for their actions.

The court also warned that the support of the State apparatus for illegal and unauthorized constructions must stop, or even rural areas of the country will soon witness similar chaotic conditions. This warning highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address the issue of illegal and unauthorized constructions. The public authorities must take necessary steps to ensure that the sanctioned plans and regulations are implemented effectively. They must also impose adequate penalties on wrongdoers and provide relief to the affected parties.

In conclusion, the recent court orders highlight the importance of planned development and the need for public authorities to impose adequate penalties on wrongdoers who violate relevant laws, master plans, zoning plans, and building regulations. The issue of illegal and unauthorized constructions is a major problem in India, and it requires a comprehensive approach to address it effectively. The judiciary has played a crucial role in addressing this issue, and it is important that the public authorities take necessary steps to implement the sanctioned plans and regulations effectively.
