The court order pertains to a petition filed by M.G. Santhanaraj against a notification issued by the Department of Fisheries in Tamil Nadu, which prohibits fishing by pair trawling or fishing with purse-seine nets by any fishing vessel/craft in the entire coastal area of Tamil Nadu in the territorial waters. The petitioner, who is a fisherman and the President of Rasapet Village Administration, argues that the ban affects the livelihood of many fishermen and that there is no rationale for imposing such a ban. The court notes that a similar issue had come up in the Supreme Court in 1994, where the use of purse-seine nets was found to encircle incoming shoals and prevent them from moving towards the shore. The court has not yet made a decision on the petition.

In another court order, the use of purse seine nets in fishing is deemed harmful to the fish stock and threatens the livelihood of poor fishermen. The court has imposed restrictions on the use of these nets to protect the interests of weaker sections of society and the general public. The order also directs the government to effectively implement a ban on purse seine nets and take measures to curb their use. A status report filed by the Assistant Director of Fisheries in Cuddalore shows that measures are being taken to enforce the ban.

The court order bans purse seine net fishing in certain areas and lists the names and addresses of individuals who have been charged with fishing in these areas. One boat owner has been issued a charge sheet for not attending an enquiry, and a second summons has been sent for them to attend. The offence is fishing in an inshore area, as specified in Section 5 Sub Section (3).

The court order pertains to a case involving the use of banned fishing nets in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu. The order mentions the attendance of individuals at an enquiry on a specific date, as well as the acceptance of a charge sheet and payment of a penalty by one of the individuals involved. The order also describes the actions taken by the District Collector and Assistant Director of Fisheries to curb the use of banned nets, including the formation of a committee and the issuance of warning letters. The order notes that efforts have been made to educate boat owners on the illegal use of banned nets.

The Director of Fisheries and Inspector of Marine Police conducted a joint inspection in the conservative zone and identified 10 fishing boats using banned purse seine nets. Legal proceedings were held under the Marine Fisheries Regulation Act-1983, and two boat owners attended the enquiry and paid a penalty of Rs. 5000 each. The remaining boat owners were summoned to appear for enquiry, and failure to do so would result in penalties under Section 15. The court order emphasizes the need for awareness programs on the ill effects of using banned nets and the importance of systematic fishing to prevent depletion and extinction of fish varieties. The court also reminds that judges should not perform legislative or executive functions.

The court has enormous power but should not undertake governmental duties or functions. The role of the higher judiciary is to uphold the rule of law and act within their judicially permissible limitations. The court should not interfere in matters of policy or become an approval authority for public projects and policies initiated by the government. If a considered policy decision has been taken, which is not in conflict with any law or is not mala fide, it will not be in public interest to require the court to investigate those areas which are the function of the executive. Judges must know their limits and not try to run the government. Adjudication must be done within the system of historically validated restraints and conscious minimization of the judges' preferences. The court must not embarrass the administrative authorities and must realize that administrative authorities have expertise in the field of administration while the court does not.

The court order emphasizes that the judiciary should not act as a superboard or substitute its judgment for that of the administrator. It also states that the judiciary does not have the expertise or resources to take over the functions of the legislature or executive. The court dismisses the writ petition and states that policy decisions of the government can only be interfered with if they violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The order is addressed to various government officials and departments.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the use of purse seine nets in fishing and the ban on their use in certain areas of Tamil Nadu. The court has imposed restrictions on the use of these nets to protect the interests of weaker sections of society and the general public. The court has also emphasized the need for awareness programs on the ill effects of using banned nets and the importance of systematic fishing to prevent depletion and extinction of fish varieties. The court has reminded judges not to perform legislative or executive functions and to adjudicate within the system of historically validated restraints. The court has dismissed the writ petition and stated that policy decisions of the government can only be interfered with if they violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
