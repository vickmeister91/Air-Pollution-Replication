The court order in question pertains to a civil revision filed by J.P. Ojha against a decision made by the District Judge of Aligarh. The plaintiff had filed a suit for the recovery of Rs. 1,000/-, which was partly decreed. The plaintiff's counsel filed a revision without filing a fresh vakalatnama, which led to the learned Judge ruling that the revision was not properly presented. The Judge's decision was based on the fact that the vakalatnama filed in the lower court did not provide an 'express right' to the counsel to file a revision on behalf of the applicant.

However, the court found that the Judge's view was too technical and that the wider term 'appeal' used in Order III Rule 4 (3) should be deemed to include the word 'revision.' The court also noted that the revision had been admitted and listed for final hearing, and therefore, the Judge could not take the view that the revision was not properly presented. The court set aside the Judge's order and directed that the revision be treated as properly presented and dealt with according to law.

The case highlights the importance of technicalities in legal proceedings and the need for lawyers to be aware of the specific requirements for filing different types of appeals. In this case, the Judge's decision was based on a narrow interpretation of the vakalatnama, which did not explicitly grant the counsel the right to file a revision. However, the court found that the term 'appeal' should be interpreted more broadly to include revisions, which are a type of appeal.

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures in legal proceedings. The plaintiff's counsel had failed to file a fresh vakalatnama, which led to the Judge's ruling that the revision was not properly presented. However, the court found that the revision had been admitted and listed for final hearing, which indicated that it had been properly presented. This highlights the need for lawyers to be diligent in following proper procedures and ensuring that all necessary documents are filed correctly.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the interpretation of legal procedures and the importance of following proper procedures in legal proceedings. It also highlights the need for lawyers to be aware of the specific requirements for filing different types of appeals and to be diligent in following proper procedures.
