The Gujarat High Court recently heard a criminal appeal against the acquittal of respondents accused of violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The prosecution had accused the respondents of breaching the conditions on which permission was given to discharge polluted water. The trial court had found the respondents guilty, but the Sessions Court acquitted them. The High Court upheld the Sessions Court's decision, stating that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court order states that the Sessions Court has acquitted the respondents-accused based on the lack of evidence and the failure of the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant's counsel was unable to provide any evidence to challenge the decision or show any illegality or infirmity in the approach of the Sessions Court. The court finds no reason to interfere with the decision and dismisses the appeal, confirming the acquittal of the respondents-accused. The bail bond, if any, is cancelled, and the record and proceedings are sent back to the trial court.
