The Gujarat Pollution Control Board has filed an appeal against the acquittal of the partners of Divine Intermediates and Chemicals in a case where they were accused of discharging trade effluent without purifying it, ultimately polluting the water of the River Khari. The appeal argues that the learned Metropolitan Magistrate erred in reading and applying Section 21 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the accused No. 2 did not request the sample to be divided into two parts, as required under Section 21(3)(b) of the said Act, and that there was a clear breach of the rules of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 in respect of following the procedure for submitting the samples to State Water Laboratory.

In another case, the court discussed a case where the defendant was charged with violating the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The court found that the defendant had breached Rule 27 by collecting a sample of 5 litres instead of the required 2.5 litres and failing to comply with the procedure for collecting and submitting the sample to the laboratory. The court held that the rules were mandatory and non-compliance would vitiate the trial. The defendant's argument that the rules were directory and that non-compliance was a mere irregularity was rejected. The court dismissed the appeal and found the defendant guilty of the charges.

The two cases discussed above highlight the importance of complying with the rules and regulations set forth by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The first case shows that failure to comply with the procedure for submitting samples to the State Water Laboratory can result in an acquittal being overturned on appeal. The second case shows that non-compliance with the rules can result in the trial being vitiated and the defendant being found guilty of the charges.
