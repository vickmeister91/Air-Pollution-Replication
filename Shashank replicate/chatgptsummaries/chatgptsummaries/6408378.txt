The court has granted bail to the petitioner, Lohare, in a criminal case registered at Police Station-Kotwali, Dholpur for offenses under sections 143, 279, 332, 353, 307 & 379 of IPC and section 29/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has considered the fact that the co-accused has been granted bail and the injuries to the injured cannot be due to the accident from a tractor. The petitioner has been asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000/- and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial court for his appearance before that Court on all subsequent dates of hearing.

The case in question involves the petitioner, Lohare, who has been charged with several offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Wild Life Protection Act. The charges include offenses such as rioting, endangering life or personal safety of others, causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, attempt to murder, and theft of property. The petitioner has been accused of being involved in a violent incident that resulted in injuries to several individuals, including a police officer.

The court has granted bail to the petitioner after considering several factors. Firstly, the court has taken into account the fact that the co-accused in the case has already been granted bail. This suggests that the court does not consider the petitioner to be a flight risk or a danger to society. Secondly, the court has noted that the injuries sustained by the victims cannot be attributed to an accident involving a tractor, as claimed by the petitioner. This suggests that the court does not believe the petitioner's version of events and considers him to be potentially culpable for the injuries sustained by the victims.

In granting bail to the petitioner, the court has imposed certain conditions. The petitioner has been asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000/- and one surety in the like amount. This is a standard requirement for bail in criminal cases and is intended to ensure that the petitioner appears before the court on all subsequent dates of hearing. The court has also emphasized that the petitioner must comply with all other conditions that may be imposed by the trial court.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner in this case is based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. While the petitioner has been charged with serious offenses, the court has determined that he is not a flight risk or a danger to society. However, the court has also made it clear that the petitioner must comply with all conditions imposed by the trial court and must appear before the court on all subsequent dates of hearing.
