The case at hand involves a civil suit filed by the petitioner for declaration and permanent injunction, as well as mandatory injunction. The petitioner claims to have sold 25 acres of land out of Khasra No.83/2, which has a total area of 30 acres, through four registered sale deeds executed in September 2008. The sale deeds were executed with the condition that the purchaser would permit the seller to use the approach road through the demised premises in order to approach the remaining land of the seller, which is 5 acres, along with other ancillary conditions for providing certain amenities for the purpose of sewerage and electricity connection.

However, the trial court rejected the application of the petitioner seeking injunction. The trial court opined that there is currently no road from "A to A" and, therefore, in the absence of any road, permission cannot be granted to the petitioner to use the same. The petitioner has not established that any other road was permitted to be used by the petitioner. The lower appellate court has given a specific finding that the land through which the petitioner is seeking passage/movement is a part of government land. Hence, the petitioner needs to take proper permission. The petitioner has not challenged the correctness of those findings given by the lower appellate court in the present petition.

The crux of the matter is the permission to use the approach road through the demised premises. The petitioner claims that the sale deeds were executed with the condition that the purchaser would permit the seller to use the approach road through the demised premises in order to approach the remaining land of the seller. However, the trial court rejected the application of the petitioner seeking injunction on the grounds that there is currently no road from "A to A" and, therefore, permission cannot be granted to the petitioner to use the same.

The lower appellate court has given a specific finding that the land through which the petitioner is seeking passage/movement is a part of government land. Hence, the petitioner needs to take proper permission. The petitioner has not challenged the correctness of those findings given by the lower appellate court in the present petition. Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner needs to take proper permission from the government to use the approach road through the demised premises.

In conclusion, the court has rejected the application of the petitioner seeking injunction on the grounds that there is currently no road from "A to A" and the land through which the petitioner is seeking passage/movement is a part of government land. The petitioner needs to take proper permission from the government to use the approach road through the demised premises. The lower appellate court has given a specific finding in this regard, and the petitioner has not challenged the correctness of those findings given by the lower appellate court in the present petition.
