The Kerala High Court recently heard a criminal revision petition filed by M/S. Philips Carbon Black Limited and two of its employees against an order in a complaint filed by Sabu Thozhupadan. The complaint alleged that the company caused pollution in the area and failed to comply with the Pollution Control Board's direction to close down the units. The court held that there were sufficient grounds to frame charges against the petitioners and the second respondent for the offense under section 37 of the Air (Prevention of Control and Pollution Act, 1981). The court also noted that defense evidence cannot be looked into by the learned Magistrate to decide whether charges should be framed or not.

The case in question involves a company that was found to be violating air pollution control laws by operating a new unit without obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board. Despite being ordered to shut down the unit, the company continued to operate it and was found to be polluting the air. The court rejected the company's argument that they obtained consent later and upheld the decision to not discharge them from the case. The order includes several annexures, including copies of complaints, orders, and reports related to the case.

The court order also includes several annexures, which are true copies of various orders, undertakings, letters, and judgments related to the Pollution Control Board and a petitioner company. The order numbers and dates are provided for each annexure.

The court's decision to frame charges against the petitioners and the second respondent for the offense under section 37 of the Air (Prevention of Control and Pollution Act, 1981) is a significant development in the case. This section deals with the punishment for offenses related to the emission of air pollutants. The court's decision indicates that it takes the issue of air pollution seriously and is willing to hold companies accountable for their actions.

The court's rejection of the company's argument that they obtained consent later is also noteworthy. This decision reinforces the importance of obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board before operating a new unit. It also sends a message to other companies that they cannot simply obtain consent after the fact to avoid legal consequences.

The annexures included in the court order provide additional context and information related to the case. They include copies of complaints, orders, and reports related to the case, which can help interested parties better understand the issues at hand. The order numbers and dates provided for each annexure make it easy to locate and reference specific documents.

Overall, the court order represents a significant development in the case involving M/S. Philips Carbon Black Limited and its employees. The court's decision to frame charges against the petitioners and the second respondent for the offense under section 37 of the Air (Prevention of Control and Pollution Act, 1981) sends a strong message that companies must take responsibility for their actions related to air pollution. The annexures included in the order provide additional context and information related to the case, making it easier for interested parties to understand the issues at hand.
