The R.M. Dhariwal 100% EOU had filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus that the exemption contained under Rule-2 of Plastic Wastes (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011 must be available to the petitioner to export its Pan Masala, Gutkha and tobacco in multilayered plastic sachet and also in other packages containing plastic. The court ordered that during the pendency of the present proceedings, the petitioner shall stand exempted from the operation of the 2011 Rules on the understanding that it shall strictly abide by all the terms contained in the Undertaking furnished by it in terms of its Affidavit dated 28th July 2015.

The Plastic Wastes (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011 were enacted to regulate the management and handling of plastic waste in the country. The rules were aimed at reducing the impact of plastic waste on the environment and promoting sustainable development. The rules prohibited the use of plastic bags below 50 microns in thickness and also prohibited the use of plastic for packaging gutkha, pan masala, and tobacco products.

The R.M. Dhariwal 100% EOU, a company engaged in the manufacture and export of pan masala, gutkha, and tobacco products, had challenged the applicability of the rules to its products. The company had argued that the rules were not applicable to its products as they were meant for export and not for domestic consumption. The company had also argued that the use of plastic was necessary for the packaging of its products as it helped in preserving the quality and freshness of the products.

The court, while hearing the petition, had observed that the issue raised by the petitioner was of considerable importance as it involved the interpretation of the rules and their applicability to export-oriented units. The court had also noted that the issue had not been settled by any court of law and, therefore, required a detailed examination.

The court had directed the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that it would strictly abide by all the terms contained in its affidavit dated 28th July 2015. The undertaking required the petitioner to ensure that the plastic used for packaging its products was of a thickness of not less than 50 microns and that the products were packed in such a way that they did not pose a threat to the environment.

The court had also directed the petitioner to submit a report to the court every six months regarding the steps taken by it to ensure compliance with the undertaking. The court had further directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs with the court as a security for the due compliance of the undertaking.

The court had observed that the exemption contained under Rule-2 of the Plastic Wastes (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011 was meant to provide relief to certain categories of persons or entities from the operation of the rules. The court had noted that the exemption was not absolute and was subject to certain conditions and limitations.

The court had held that the petitioner was entitled to the exemption contained under Rule-2 of the Plastic Wastes (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011 during the pendency of the present proceedings. The court had, however, made it clear that the exemption was subject to the petitioner strictly abiding by all the terms contained in the undertaking furnished by it.

In conclusion, the court had granted relief to the R.M. Dhariwal 100% EOU by exempting it from the operation of the Plastic Wastes (Management & Handling) Rules, 2011 during the pendency of the present proceedings. The court had, however, made it clear that the exemption was subject to the petitioner strictly abiding by all the terms contained in the undertaking furnished by it. The court had also directed the petitioner to submit a report to the court every six months regarding the steps taken by it to ensure compliance with the undertaking. The court had further directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs with the court as a security for the due compliance of the undertaking.
