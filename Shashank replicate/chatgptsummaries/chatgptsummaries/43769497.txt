The Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) recently challenged an appellate order passed by the National Green Tribunal, Central Zone Bench, Bhopal. The petitioner argued that the writ petition is maintainable under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India. However, the Union of India argued that due regard must be had to the statutory mechanism including the remedy of appeal provided under the Act, 2010. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition, reserving liberty in favor of the petitioner to prefer an appeal in accordance with the law.

The case at hand involves a dispute between SAIL and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over environmental concerns. SAIL had been accused of violating environmental norms and was subsequently fined by the NGT. SAIL appealed the decision, but the NGT dismissed the appeal. SAIL then filed a writ petition challenging the NGT's decision.

In its writ petition, SAIL argued that the NGT's decision was arbitrary and lacked any legal basis. SAIL also argued that the NGT had exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing a fine on the company. SAIL further contended that the writ petition was maintainable under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India.

The Union of India, on the other hand, argued that SAIL's writ petition was not maintainable. The Union of India contended that the NGT had acted within its jurisdiction and that SAIL had failed to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. The Union of India also argued that due regard must be had to the statutory mechanism including the remedy of appeal provided under the Act, 2010.

After hearing both sides, the court dismissed SAIL's writ petition. The court held that the NGT had acted within its jurisdiction and that SAIL had failed to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. The court also held that due regard must be had to the statutory mechanism including the remedy of appeal provided under the Act, 2010.

However, the court did reserve liberty in favor of SAIL to prefer an appeal in accordance with the law. This means that SAIL can still challenge the NGT's decision by filing an appeal in the appropriate forum. The court's decision, therefore, does not completely foreclose SAIL's ability to challenge the NGT's decision.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. It also underscores the need to give due regard to the statutory mechanism including the remedy of appeal provided under the Act, 2010. While SAIL's writ petition was dismissed, the court did reserve liberty in favor of the company to prefer an appeal in accordance with the law. This means that SAIL still has the opportunity to challenge the NGT's decision and seek a favorable outcome.
