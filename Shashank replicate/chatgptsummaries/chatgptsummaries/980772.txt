The court orders the distribution licensee to ensure availability of forms, process applications in chronological order, and provide transparency in the operation.

The court also rules that the distribution licensee must comply with the time frame stipulated in the Electricity Act and cannot delay connection due to transformer availability. The court discusses the discontinuation of the SWID certificate requirement and the implementation of the West Bengal Ground Water Resources Act. The court rules that the provisions of the two enactments must be considered together and that the distribution licensee cannot ignore the provisions of the West Bengal Ground Water Resources Act when providing electricity for submersible pumps.

The court order further discusses the interconnection between the Electricity Act, 2003 and the West Bengal Act XVIII of 2005, which regulates the extraction of groundwater. The court orders the distribution licensee and water management authorities to work together to ensure compliance with both statutes.
