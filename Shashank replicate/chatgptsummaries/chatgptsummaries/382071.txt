In the first court order, the State of Maharashtra filed a petition against Gajanan D. Jambhulkar for the release of a motor vehicle used in the commission of an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The respondent had filed an application seeking the release of the vehicle on Supratnama, which was granted by the Judicial Magistrate. However, the State argued that the release of the vehicle was likely to frustrate the provisions of the Act and that the Magistrate had not considered the involvement of the vehicle in the offense.

The court quashed the order and directed the respondent to surrender the vehicle to the Magistrate, who would decide on its disposal at the conclusion of the trial. The court also directed the Magistrate to expedite the trial and decide the case within six months. This decision was made to ensure that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act were not frustrated and that justice was served in a timely manner.

In the second court order, an application was dismissed and a rule was made absolute with no order for costs. The details of the application and rule were not provided, but it can be assumed that the court found no merit in the application and therefore dismissed it. The rule that was made absolute may have been related to a separate matter, but again, no details were provided.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following the provisions of the law and ensuring that justice is served in a timely manner. The court's decision to quash the order for the release of the motor vehicle in the first case shows that the court takes the enforcement of the Wild Life Protection Act seriously and will not allow for its provisions to be frustrated. The court's decision to dismiss the application in the second case shows that the court will not entertain frivolous or meritless applications.
