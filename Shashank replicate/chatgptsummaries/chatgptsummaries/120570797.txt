The Rajasthan High Court recently received multiple petitions from stone crusher owners who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court had previously allowed the owners to appear before the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board to address the issues, but the Board refused to grant consent to operate to the petitioners. The Board also issued orders to close the units, leading to the owners filing petitions with the court.

The Board argued that the owners had an alternate remedy available to them, but the owners claimed that the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the Board had the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution. However, the court also noted that the orders issued by the Board were non-speaking orders and violated principles of natural justice. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration.

The court order discusses the powers of the State Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The order also addresses the right to file an appeal against an order, but not against directions. The court finds that the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court due to violations of natural justice and fundamental rights. The Board argues that it was justified in relying on previous notices and replies from the petitioners, and that it had given cogent reasons for its decisions. The court ultimately upholds the writ petitions.

In another case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, the Board had issued an order to close down the stone crusher units due to non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court found that the Board did not follow the proper procedure for granting or revoking consent to operate, and the notice given to the stone crusher units was vague and unclear. Therefore, the court declared the Board's orders to be legally unsustainable. The court also emphasized the importance of following due process and giving clear and specific notices when taking action against industries for non-compliance with pollution control measures.

The court order grants a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that fails to comply with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher in question had deficiencies in its pollution control measures, but the Board did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders dated 04.02.2010, but directed the Board to consider the applications filed by the petitioners for renewal of the consent order and to inspect the sites to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government is also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has been dealing with multiple petitions from stone crusher owners who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court has noted the power of the State Board to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution, but has also emphasized the importance of following due process and giving clear and specific notices when taking action against industries for non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court has quashed and set aside impugned orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration, and has ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones.
