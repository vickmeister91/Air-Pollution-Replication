The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently heard a case filed by Kehar Singh against the State of Haryana regarding the establishment of a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) near his agricultural land. The respondent argued that the application was filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation and that no environmental clearance was required for the STP. The applicant claimed that the STP would cause environmental issues and hurt religious sentiments. The respondent argued that the STP was based on the latest technology and would not cause any nuisance or pollution. The respondent also argued that the application was barred by time and laches. The Tribunal treated the issue of limitation as a preliminary issue and proceeded to deal with it first.

The court order discusses a case where the State intends to set up an STP project at a site, and the applicant files an application three years later, which is beyond the six-month limitation period. The court states that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond six months plus 60 days from the date the cause of action had arisen. The court also examines Section 14 of the NGT Act, which prescribes the limitation for institution of an application and states that the Tribunal cannot entertain an application beyond the prescribed period of six months. The court also discusses the wide jurisdiction of the Tribunal in relation to substantial questions relating to the environment and enforcement of legal rights relating to the environment.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act and its jurisdiction over disputes related to environmental issues. The court emphasizes that the NGT Act is specific to environmental issues and disputes must relate to the Acts specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. The court also discusses the meaning of "dispute" and "cause of action" in the context of the NGT Act. The court concludes that the present case falls within the jurisdiction of the NGT and that the cause of action must have a nexus to the environmental dispute to trigger the prescribed period of limitation.

The court order discusses the concept of "cause of action" in relation to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act. The court states that the cause of action must be relevant to the dispute being raised and must fall within the jurisdiction of the NGT. The court also discusses the issue of limitation and concludes that the applicant's petition is not time-barred. The court further discusses the definition of "environment" and related terms under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the NGT Act.

The court order discusses the definition of "environment" and "environmental pollutants" under the Act of 1986, which includes everything related to water, air, land, living creatures, and plants. The right to life with human dignity includes the preservation of the environment and ecological balance, and it is the duty of both the state and citizens to maintain a hygienic environment. The court also discusses the Notification of 2006, which requires environmental clearance for various projects and activities, including common effluent treatment plants and common municipal solid waste management facilities. The court considers whether sewage treatment plants should also be included under these entries and concludes that a liberal interpretation should be adopted to further the object of protecting and improving the environment.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the Notification of 2006, which regulates the prevention and control of environmental pollution. The court examines the legislative intent behind the law and emphasizes the need for a purposive interpretation to achieve its objectives. The court also discusses the definition of municipal solid waste and effluent and concludes that sewage, which contains domestic and trade effluents, falls under the definition of municipal solid waste. The court further explains the need for environmental clearance for projects dealing with effluent treatment, including sewage treatment plants, to ensure adherence to environmental standards and prevent harm to the environment.

The court order discusses the requirement for environmental clearance (EC) for establishment, expansion, and modernization of combined wastewater treatment plants (CETPs) under the Notification of 2006. Any treatment plant dealing with effluents having more than 10% of industrial contributions by volume must be treated as a combined treatment plant. The court emphasizes the importance of obtaining EC at the initial stages of installation of a sewage treatment plant (STP) to ensure adherence to prescribed standards and prevent environmental degradation. The court directs the respondent to seek EC from SEIAA and complete the entire exercise of granting clearance within two months. The order also states that there shall be no order as to costs.
