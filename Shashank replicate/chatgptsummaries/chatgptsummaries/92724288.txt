The Anand Gram Society Hansens Disease (Leprosy) has filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal, Western Zone. The petitioner has requested the court to call for the record and proceedings in respect of Gat No.78 Dudulgaon, Taluka Haveli, District Pune from the file of the learned Collector, Pune. The petitioner has also requested the court to pass a writ of certiorari or any other writ, order or direction in the like nature, thereby quashing and setting aside the impugned notice dated 20.11.2017 issued under Indian Forest Act, 1927 by Forest Zone Officer and order dated 26.05.2017 passed below (Item no.7, Order No.20) in Application No.115 of 2015 (WZ) and order dated 23.01.2018 passed below (item No.3) in Original Application No.120 of 2017 (WZ) with Application No.115 of 2017 (WZ). The case pertains to the removal of encroachments on forest lands in Pune.

The court order discusses a case where the Forest Department is taking action to demolish a petitioner's construction on forest land. The petitioner argues that the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) were done without hearing them. The petitioner also argues that the second order passed by a single member of the NGT is invalid as it was not heard by a bench consisting of a Judicial and an Expert member. The State Government disputes the petitioner's claim of ownership of the land and states that the land is a reserved forest. The court restrains the respondents from taking any action in respect of the property in possession of the petitioner and structures thereon.

The court order states that the Forest Officer has the power to remove any encroachment on reserved forests as per section 26 (1-A) of the Act. The petitioner has admitted to encroaching on the reserved forest and therefore has no right to get the encroachment regularized. The National Green Tribunal has asked the respondents to remove the encroachment, and the petitioner cannot raise a grievance that they were not heard by the NGT. The court also discusses the maintainability of the petition in view of an alternate remedy available to the petitioner under section 22 of the NGT Act, which provides an appeal to the Supreme Court. The NGT Act is a special legislation that provides for the establishment of the National Green Tribunal for effective and expeditious decisions in cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court concludes that the petition is not maintainable in view of the specific alternate remedy created by the NGT Act.

The court order discusses the need for specialized environmental courts to handle multi-disciplinary issues related to environmental cases. The National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009 was introduced to establish the National Green Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of civil cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court also notes that while the power of judicial review remains with the High Court, the court would be slow to interfere except in exceptional cases. The court also emphasizes the importance of exhausting all remedies available under the relevant statute before seeking relief under Article 226 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining writ petitions that raise questions of jurisdiction of a tribunal. The court cites a previous judgment that states that it is not appropriate for the High Court to entertain writ petitions against orders passed by a commission when a statutory appeal is provided. The court concludes that the petitioner in this case had other available remedies and therefore the petition is dismissed, but interim protection is granted for four weeks to allow the petitioner to seek appropriate remedy. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the Anand Gram Society Hansens Disease (Leprosy) filed a petition against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal, Western Zone, regarding the removal of encroachments on forest lands in Pune. The petitioner argued that they were not heard by the NGT and that the second order passed by a single member was invalid. The court restrained the respondents from taking any action on the property in possession of the petitioner. However, the court also stated that the petitioner had no right to get the encroachment regularized and that the petition was not maintainable in view of the specific alternate remedy created by the NGT Act. The court emphasized the importance of exhausting all remedies available under the relevant statute before seeking relief under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also discussed the need for specialized environmental courts and the jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining writ petitions that raise questions of jurisdiction of a tribunal. The petition was dismissed, but interim protection was granted for four weeks to allow the petitioner to seek appropriate remedy.
