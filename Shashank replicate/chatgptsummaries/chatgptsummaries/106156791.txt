The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant had filed a private complaint against the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act). During the pendency of the case, the respondent filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) alleging that the applicant was a money lender and was doing money lending business without a license. The trial court allowed the application, and the revision petition filed against it was dismissed by the Additional Sessions Judge. The applicant challenged this order in the High Court, arguing that the M.P. Money Lenders Act was not applicable in cases filed under Section 138 of the NI Act.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the trial court had not committed any legal error in directing the applicant to file certified copies of the complaint cases mentioned in the application filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court observed that the purpose of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C is to enable the court to order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court further noted that the M.P. Money Lenders Act was enacted to regulate money lending activities in the state of Madhya Pradesh and to protect the interests of borrowers. The court held that the provisions of the M.P. Money Lenders Act were not inconsistent with the provisions of the NI Act and that the trial court was justified in directing the applicant to produce certified copies of the complaint cases mentioned in the application filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court also rejected the argument of the applicant that the M.P. Money Lenders Act was not applicable in cases filed under Section 138 of the NI Act. The court observed that the NI Act does not contain any provision which excludes the application of the M.P. Money Lenders Act in cases filed under Section 138 of the NI Act. The court held that the M.P. Money Lenders Act was applicable in cases filed under Section 138 of the NI Act and that the trial court was justified in directing the applicant to produce certified copies of the complaint cases mentioned in the application filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the applicant, stating that no interference was warranted in the case. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of complying with the provisions of the Cr.P.C and other relevant laws while pursuing legal remedies. It also highlights the need for borrowers and money lenders to be aware of the provisions of the M.P. Money Lenders Act and other relevant laws to avoid legal complications.
