The court order pertains to a petition filed by a petitioner seeking a mandamus to restore the electric connection of his tube-well in a specific village. The petitioner had previously been granted an electricity connection, but it was later transferred to a new location. The transfer was subject to the petitioner submitting a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Environment Authorities and obtaining a 'No Objection' from the co-sharers.

However, the petitioner was unable to obtain the NOC from the Environment Authorities, and as a result, the court dismissed the petition. The court did, however, allow the petitioner to challenge the order.

The petitioner's request for a mandamus is a legal remedy that seeks to compel a public official or government agency to perform a specific duty. In this case, the petitioner was seeking to compel the electricity department to restore his electric connection.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to obtain the necessary NOC from the Environment Authorities. The court's decision was in line with the law, which requires individuals to obtain the necessary permits and approvals before undertaking any activity that may have an impact on the environment.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to challenge the order means that the petitioner can file an appeal against the decision. The petitioner can argue that the requirement to obtain an NOC from the Environment Authorities was unreasonable or that the petitioner was not given sufficient time to obtain the NOC.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permits and approvals before undertaking any activity that may have an impact on the environment. It also underscores the importance of following due process and seeking legal remedies when necessary.
