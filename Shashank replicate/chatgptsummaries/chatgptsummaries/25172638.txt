The court order pertains to two separate petitions filed by different entities, both questioning their liability to pay water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The first petition was filed by Hindu College of Pharmacy, Sonipat, while the second petition was filed by an unnamed petitioner responsible for supplying water to visitors in certain complexes.

In the case of Hindu College of Pharmacy, the petitioner argued that it is neither a 'local authority' nor a 'specified industry' as defined under the Act, and therefore not liable to pay water cess. The court agreed with the petitioner and held that the institution is not covered by the Act and therefore not liable to pay water cess. The court cited a previous case involving Haryana Tourism Corporation Ltd, where it was held that the corporation was not liable to pay water cess as it was not a 'local authority' and did not fall under any of the 'specified industries' listed in the Act.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and the entities that are liable to pay water cess under the Act. The court's interpretation of the Act suggests that only 'local authorities' and 'specified industries' are liable to pay water cess, and other entities, such as educational institutions, are not covered by the Act.

In the second petition, the petitioner responsible for supplying water to visitors in certain complexes questioned their liability to pay water cess under the Act. The court order declares that the petitioner is not responsible for supplying water to visitors in the complexes under the law, and therefore is not liable to pay water cess. The orders dated 26.9.1986, 26.2.1990, and 19.4.1991 are quashed.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the responsibilities of entities responsible for supplying water to visitors in certain complexes, and their liability to pay water cess under the Act. The court's interpretation of the Act suggests that only entities responsible for supplying water to visitors in certain complexes are liable to pay water cess, and other entities, such as the petitioner in this case, are not covered by the Act.

Overall, the court's decisions in these two cases provide important clarifications on the scope of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and the entities that are liable to pay water cess under the Act. The court's interpretation of the Act suggests that only 'local authorities' and 'specified industries' are liable to pay water cess, and other entities, such as educational institutions and entities responsible for supplying water to visitors in certain complexes, are not covered by the Act.
