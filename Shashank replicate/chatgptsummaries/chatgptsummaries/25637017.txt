The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Smt. Panna Devi under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, seeking possession of a shop in Delhi for the bonafide requirement of her grandsons. The property in question was jointly purchased by three brothers, and after the death of one of them, his share was inherited by his legal representatives. The petitioner is one of the legal representatives and wants the tenanted shop for herself and her grandsons. The court has granted the eviction petition.

The petitioner, Panna Devi, wants to evict her tenant, Dinesh Bajaj, from a shop in her property so that she can provide additional space to her grandsons for their expanding business. The respondent argues that the petitioner is not the legal owner of the tenanted premises and that her need for additional space is not genuine. The respondent also claims that the petitioner's documents are questionable and invalid. The respondent further argues that the petitioner's elder son, Mithilesh Kumar, executed a relinquishment deed in his favour, making him the owner of the tenanted premises. The respondent also claims that the petitioner's grandsons are not dependent on her and that the petitioner's need for additional space is malafide.

The court order states that the petitioner is not the owner of the entire suit property and that the family arrangement mentioned is fictitious. The petitioner is only a landlady and is holding the tenanted premises for the benefit of Mithilesh Kumar, who is the actual owner of the suit property. The court also notes that there are several grounds to allow the application for leave to defend to enable the respondent/tenant to contest the petition. The court further explains the legal principles to decide the application of leave to defend and the court's observations on the case.

The court order states that the petitioner and her family members have the right to make arrangements for the use of a total area of 240 sq. yards, and no third person can dispute the arrangement. The petitioner is shown to be the owner of the property in green, and the respondent's claim that she is not the owner is rejected. The court also notes that the rent agreement and earnest money receipt do not confer ownership title in favor of the tenant, and the landlady has the right to seek eviction for her bonafide requirement. The court finds that there is a bonafide need for eviction and denies the tenant's claim for alternative accommodation. The eviction order is passed, but the landlord cannot take possession until six months from the date of the order.
