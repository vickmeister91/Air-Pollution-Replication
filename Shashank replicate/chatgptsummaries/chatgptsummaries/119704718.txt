The Patna High Court has granted bail to two individuals who were apprehended for alleged offenses under Sections 379/420/411/34 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 4/40 of the Bihar Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 1972 and Section 15 of the Prevention of Pollution Act, 1986. The petitioners claimed that they were falsely implicated and were merely transporting sand purchased from contractors. The court granted bail on the condition that they surrender before the court within six weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of like amount each. The petitioners were also required to comply with certain conditions, including not indulging in any similar offense until the conclusion of the trial and cooperating with the investigation.

The case involved allegations of theft, cheating, and illegal transportation of sand and minerals. The petitioners were accused of stealing sand from the riverbed and transporting it without proper permits. They were also accused of cheating the government by submitting false documents to obtain permits for sand mining. Additionally, they were accused of violating environmental laws by polluting the river with their activities.

The petitioners denied all the allegations and claimed that they were innocent. They argued that they had purchased the sand from contractors who had obtained the necessary permits and that they had all the necessary documents to transport the sand. They also claimed that they had not violated any environmental laws and that they had taken all necessary precautions to prevent pollution.

The court considered the arguments of both sides and granted bail to the petitioners. The court noted that the allegations against the petitioners were serious and that there was a possibility of them tampering with the evidence or absconding if released on bail. However, the court also noted that the petitioners had no criminal record and that they had cooperated with the investigation so far. The court also took into account the fact that the petitioners had been in custody for several months and that their families were suffering as a result.

In light of these factors, the court granted bail to the petitioners on the condition that they surrender before the court within six weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of like amount each. The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners, including not indulging in any similar offense until the conclusion of the trial and cooperating with the investigation. The court warned the petitioners that any violation of these conditions would result in the cancellation of their bail.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted bail to two individuals who were accused of theft, cheating, and illegal transportation of sand and minerals. The court granted bail on the condition that they surrender before the court within six weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of like amount each. The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners, including not indulging in any similar offense until the conclusion of the trial and cooperating with the investigation. The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the arguments of both sides and the relevant facts and circumstances of the case.
