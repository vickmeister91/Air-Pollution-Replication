In a recent court order, the Karnataka High Court addressed a writ petition filed by M/S Vijayalakshmi Crystals against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner was operating a stone crushing unit under a valid license issued by the competent authority. However, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board issued a closure notice under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, prompting the petitioner to seek a writ of certiorari to quash the notice.

The court found that the case was similar to a previous writ action and followed the decision of the Division Bench in that case. As a result, the court quashed the closure notice and allowed the petitioner to continue operating the stone crushing unit at the present site until its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had a valid license to operate the stone crushing unit and had complied with all necessary regulations. The court also noted that the closure notice was issued without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard, which was a violation of natural justice.

In a separate matter, it should be noted that the given text is not a court order but rather appears to be the signature or initials of a judge. Therefore, it is not relevant to the discussion of the court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by M/S Vijayalakshmi Crystals.
