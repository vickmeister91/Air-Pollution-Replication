The court order pertains to a case under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused, Mohd. Yaqoob, was charged with violating sections 44/49/49B(1) of the Act.

The court also discussed the facts of the case, including the raid conducted by the police and the recovery of the contraband animal articles.

In another case, the court order describes a case where the accused, Mohd. Yaqoob, was charged with dealing in contraband animal articles without a license. The prosecution claimed that the case was proved through witness testimony and the recovery of the articles from the accused's possession. However, the defense argued that there were contradictions in the witness statements and no independent witnesses were present during the recovery. The court found that the prosecution failed to establish that the recovered articles belonged to the accused and that the witnesses' testimony was unreliable. Therefore, the accused was acquitted.
