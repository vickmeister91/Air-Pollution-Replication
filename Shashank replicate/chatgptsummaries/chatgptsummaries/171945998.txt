The Patna High Court recently heard a case brought by M/s H.M. Craft against the State of Bihar and other respondents. The petitioner had been operating a saw mill, but was ordered to stop due to noise pollution and the fact that their 'Consent To Establish' order had lapsed. The court found no cause for indulgence and disposed of the writ petition, leaving it open to the petitioner to act in accordance with the law if they wished to run their saw mill.

The case, which was heard under Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.20002 of 2016, centered around the operation of a saw mill by M/s H.M. Craft. The petitioner had been operating the saw mill for some time, but had been ordered to stop due to noise pollution and the fact that their 'Consent To Establish' order had lapsed.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately found no cause for indulgence. The court noted that the petitioner had been given ample opportunity to comply with the law and obtain the necessary permits and licenses, but had failed to do so. As a result, the court disposed of the writ petition and left it open to the petitioner to act in accordance with the law if they wished to run their saw mill.

The court's decision was based on a number of factors. First, the court noted that the petitioner had been operating the saw mill without the necessary permits and licenses. This was a clear violation of the law and could not be condoned. Second, the court noted that the petitioner had been given ample opportunity to comply with the law and obtain the necessary permits and licenses, but had failed to do so. This showed a lack of respect for the law and the court's authority.

Finally, the court noted that the operation of the saw mill was causing noise pollution. This was a serious issue that needed to be addressed. The court recognized that noise pollution can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals, and that steps needed to be taken to mitigate this impact.

In light of these factors, the court found no cause for indulgence and disposed of the writ petition. The court's decision was clear: if the petitioner wished to run their saw mill, they would need to do so in accordance with the law. This meant obtaining the necessary permits and licenses, and taking steps to mitigate the impact of noise pollution.

Overall, the court's decision was a clear and decisive one. The court recognized the importance of upholding the law and protecting the health and well-being of individuals. While the petitioner may have been disappointed with the outcome, the court's decision was a necessary one in order to ensure that the law was upheld and that individuals were protected from the negative impacts of noise pollution.
