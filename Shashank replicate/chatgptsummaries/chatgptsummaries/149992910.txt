Two court orders have been summarized in the given text. The first order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Bijender Singh against a fine of Rs. 5100 imposed on him for driving at high speed and violating traffic rules. Singh argued that he had a valid permit at the time of the challan and that the fine was unjustified. However, the court examined the evidence and found that Singh was driving at almost double the prescribed speed limit, which was a clear violation of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The court dismissed Singh's appeal and upheld the fine imposed on him.

The second court order pertains to a case where the driver of a vehicle was found to be driving at a speed of 77 kmph in an area where the permissible speed limit was 40 kmph. The court rejected the argument that the driver was not in violation of the speed limit as he had a valid National Permit. The court imposed a fine of Rs. 5100 for various offenses under the Motor Vehicle Act and dismissed the appeal. The court also directed that a copy of the order be sent to the trial court for information and record.

Both court orders deal with cases of traffic violations and the imposition of fines on the offenders. In both cases, the drivers had violated the prescribed speed limit and were fined Rs. 5100 for their offenses. The court in both cases examined the evidence presented before it and found the drivers guilty of violating traffic rules.

In the first case, Bijender Singh had argued that he had a valid permit at the time of the challan and that the fine was unjustified. However, the court found that Singh was driving at almost double the prescribed speed limit, which was a clear violation of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The court dismissed Singh's appeal and upheld the fine imposed on him. This case highlights the importance of following traffic rules and regulations, even if one has a valid permit.

In the second case, the driver had argued that he was not in violation of the speed limit as he had a valid National Permit. However, the court rejected this argument and imposed a fine of Rs. 5100 for various offenses under the Motor Vehicle Act. The court also directed that a copy of the order be sent to the trial court for information and record. This case emphasizes the need for drivers to be aware of the speed limits in different areas and to follow them strictly.

Both court orders serve as a reminder to drivers to follow traffic rules and regulations and to be aware of the speed limits in different areas. Violating traffic rules not only puts the driver's life at risk but also endangers the lives of other road users. The imposition of fines serves as a deterrent to drivers who may be tempted to violate traffic rules. It is important for drivers to be responsible and to follow traffic rules to ensure the safety of all road users.
