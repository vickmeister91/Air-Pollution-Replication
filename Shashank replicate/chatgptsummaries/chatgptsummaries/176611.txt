The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by Electrosteel Integrated Ltd. and its employees, seeking to quash proceedings initiated against them under the Bihar Public Land Encroachment Act. The petitioners argue that the disputed questions of right, title, interest, and possession cannot be decided in summary proceedings, especially when an appeal arising out of a similar suit is pending. The State-respondents argue that the lands in question have been notified and demarcated as protected forest land under section 29 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The court heard both sides and reserved judgment.

In the second court order, the dispute is over land ownership and classification as protected forest. A Forest Settlement Officer was appointed to verify and consider relevant documents and demarcate different plots as protected forest. A notification under section 30 of the Indian Forest Act was promulgated, completing all provisions under section 29 for declaring the area as notified demarcated forest land. The petitioner argues that the respondents failed to produce a notification issued under section 29(3) of the Act and did not comply with a previous court order. The court notes that several disputed questions of fact are involved and cannot be decided in these writ petitions or in summary proceedings under the BPLE Act. The BPLE proceedings are quashed, but status quo is maintained for one month to enable parties to obtain orders from competent authority/court. The parties are free to pursue appropriate proceedings before the competent authority/courts of law.

The court order pertains to two separate cases, both involving disputes over land ownership and classification as protected forest. In the first case, Electrosteel Integrated Ltd. and its employees filed writ petitions seeking to quash proceedings initiated against them under the Bihar Public Land Encroachment Act. The petitioners argued that the disputed questions of right, title, interest, and possession cannot be decided in summary proceedings, especially when an appeal arising out of a similar suit is pending. The State-respondents argued that the lands in question have been notified and demarcated as protected forest land under section 29 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.

The court noted that several disputed questions of fact were involved in both cases and could not be decided in summary proceedings under the BPLE Act.

In both cases, the court recognized that there were several disputed questions of fact that could not be decided in summary proceedings under the BPLE Act. The court emphasized the importance of following due process and obtaining orders from competent authority/court. The court's decision to quash the BPLE proceedings in the first case and maintain status quo in the second case reflects its commitment to ensuring that disputes over land ownership and classification as protected forest are resolved through appropriate legal channels.
