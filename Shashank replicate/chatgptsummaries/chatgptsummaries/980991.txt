The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by the Nature Park Walkers Association against the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Association sought to quash a notification issued by the government under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, declaring the area as a National Park. The Association argued that the notification violated Section 23(4) of the Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976, which mandates that all vacant lands acquired by the State Government under this Act shall be disposed of to subserve the common good.

The court held that the State Government is empowered to declare any area as a National Park for the purpose of protecting, propagating or developing wild life therein or its environment by a notification. However, the court found that the clause in the notification prohibiting entry into the park was inconsistent with Section 28(2) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court order states that while the authority has the power to restrict entry into a National Park, there is no provision prohibiting entry into the park. Therefore, a clause in the notification stating that no other persons or organizations have any rights or concessions in the park is inconsistent with the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

The court also notes that while the government has the power to declare an area as a National Park, such a declaration should only be made to serve the common good and not be against the interest of the public. The court further states that any provision prohibiting the public from entering the park violates Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which protects the right to life.

The court orders the respondents to finalize guidelines for entry into the park and issue permits subject to conditions prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. Until then, the existing practice of permitting the public to enter the park shall continue.

The court order is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the protection of wildlife and the rights of the public to access natural areas. The court's decision to strike down the clause in the notification prohibiting entry into the park is a victory for the Nature Park Walkers Association and other groups advocating for public access to natural areas.

The court's ruling also highlights the importance of balancing the interests of wildlife conservation with the rights of the public. While the government has the power to declare an area as a National Park, such a declaration should only be made to serve the common good and not be against the interest of the public. The court's decision to strike down the clause in the notification prohibiting entry into the park is a clear indication that the government must consider the interests of the public when making decisions about the protection of wildlife.

The court's order to finalize guidelines for entry into the park and issue permits subject to conditions prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act is a positive step towards ensuring that the public can access natural areas while also protecting wildlife. The guidelines will provide clarity on the conditions under which the public can access the park, and the permits will ensure that visitors comply with the regulations designed to protect wildlife.

Overall, the court's order is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the protection of wildlife and the rights of the public to access natural areas. The court's decision to strike down the clause in the notification prohibiting entry into the park is a victory for the Nature Park Walkers Association and other groups advocating for public access to natural areas. The court's order to finalize guidelines for entry into the park and issue permits subject to conditions prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act is a positive step towards ensuring that the public can access natural areas while also protecting wildlife.
