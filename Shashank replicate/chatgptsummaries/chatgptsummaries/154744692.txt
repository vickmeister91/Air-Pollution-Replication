The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Rana Vishnoi and four others seeking to quash a criminal case filed against them under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners argued that the ingredients required under Section 47 of the Act were not satisfied and that the private complainant, an officer of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, had not averred about the involvement of the applicants in the day-to-day business. However, the court rejected these arguments and directed the trial court to hear the case expeditiously and dispose of it within three months.

The case pertains to allegations of pollution caused by the petitioners' industrial unit. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had conducted an inspection of the unit and found that it was operating without a valid consent to operate and was discharging untreated effluent into the nearby water bodies. The Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners under Section 41(1)(a) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which provides for punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act.

The petitioners had challenged the complaint on the grounds that the ingredients required under Section 47 of the Act were not satisfied. Section 47 provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Act except on a complaint made by the Board or any officer authorized by it. The petitioners argued that the complaint filed by the Board did not satisfy the requirements of Section 47 as it did not contain any averment about the involvement of the petitioners in the day-to-day business of the unit.

The court, however, rejected this argument and held that the complaint filed by the Board was in compliance with the requirements of Section 47. The court observed that the complaint clearly stated that the petitioners were the owners of the unit and were responsible for its day-to-day operations. The court also noted that the complaint contained specific allegations about the pollution caused by the unit and the contravention of the provisions of the Act.

The court further held that the petitioners' argument that the private complainant had not averred about their involvement in the day-to-day business was not tenable. The court observed that the private complainant was an officer of the Board and was authorized to file the complaint under Section 47. The court held that it was not necessary for the private complainant to personally witness the day-to-day operations of the unit and that the complaint filed by him was based on the inspection report of the Board.

The court directed the trial court to hear the case expeditiously and dispose of it within three months. The court observed that the case had been pending for a long time and that it was necessary to dispose of it expeditiously. The court also noted that the petitioners had not made out a case for quashing the complaint and that the trial court should proceed with the trial in accordance with law.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Rana Vishnoi and four others seeking to quash a criminal case filed against them under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court has held that the complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board was in compliance with the requirements of Section 47 of the Act and directed the trial court to hear the case expeditiously and dispose of it within three months. The court has observed that the petitioners had not made out a case for quashing the complaint and that the trial court should proceed with the trial in accordance with law.
