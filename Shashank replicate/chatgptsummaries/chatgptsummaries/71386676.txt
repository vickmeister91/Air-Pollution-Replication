The case in question involves a petition filed by Meetha Lal under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, and the revisional court, which refused to release Tractor No.MP-31-AA-6293 along with Trolley, to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were seized as case property of case FIR No.18/2018, registered at Police Station Langra, District Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the crime and were merely used for transportation purposes. The petitioner further contended that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was causing him financial hardship and was affecting his livelihood.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor along with trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court held that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was not necessary for the purpose of investigation or trial and that the petitioner had made out a case for their release.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions for the release of the tractor and trolley. The petitioner was directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The petitioner was also directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 25,000 with the trial court as a security deposit. The court further directed the petitioner to produce the tractor and trolley before the trial court whenever required and not to dispose of them without the permission of the trial court.

In conclusion, the court allowed the petition filed by Meetha Lal and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property. However, the court also imposed certain conditions for their release to ensure that they are available for investigation and trial.
