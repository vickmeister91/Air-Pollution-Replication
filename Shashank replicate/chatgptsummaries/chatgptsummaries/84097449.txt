The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/S Om Sai Vindhya Construction against the Managing Director of Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation Ltd. The petitioner challenged an order passed by the Chief Engineer (Tender) of the corporation, which cancelled the acceptance letter and prohibited the petitioner from participating in any tender proceedings for a year due to their failure to deposit the performance bank guarantee. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without affording them an opportunity of hearing.

The court found that the fact that the performance bank guarantee was not furnished by the petitioner was not disputed, but the questions of whether there was sufficient cause for not depositing it and whether the petitioner could be prohibited for a specific period for such a default needed to be decided after giving an opportunity of hearing. Therefore, the court set aside the order and directed the respondents to give a fresh show-cause notice to the petitioner proposing the penalty to be imposed on them and take appropriate action in accordance with the law.

The court observed that the principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity of hearing before any adverse order is passed against them. The court also noted that the right to participate in a tender process is a valuable right, and any decision to prohibit a person from participating in such a process should be taken after considering all relevant factors and giving an opportunity of hearing.

The court further observed that the power to impose a penalty for non-compliance with the terms of a tender document is a discretionary power, and such power should be exercised judiciously and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the respondents had not given any reasons for imposing a penalty of one year's prohibition on the petitioner, and therefore, the order was liable to be set aside.

The court also observed that the respondents had not followed the procedure laid down in the tender document for imposing a penalty, which required the issuance of a show-cause notice and an opportunity of hearing. The court noted that the respondents had not given any reasons for not following the procedure laid down in the tender document, and therefore, the order was liable to be set aside.

In conclusion, the court set aside the order passed by the Chief Engineer (Tender) of the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation Ltd. and directed the respondents to give a fresh show-cause notice to the petitioner proposing the penalty to be imposed on them and take appropriate action in accordance with the law. The court also observed that the principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity of hearing before any adverse order is passed against them, and the power to impose a penalty for non-compliance with the terms of a tender document should be exercised judiciously and in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
