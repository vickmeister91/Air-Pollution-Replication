The court order summaries pertain to various writ petitions filed against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regarding the appointment of Field Officers. The petitioners allege that the appointments made by the MPCB were illegal and violated government resolutions. The court has been asked to quash the selection list and waiting list for the posts of Field Officers and to direct the MPCB to appoint the petitioners to the said posts. The court has also been asked to set aside the appointments of certain respondents who were allegedly appointed illegally.

In one of the writ petitions, the petitioner sought to quash the selection list and waiting list for the post of Field Officer and requested a fresh advertisement. The court heard arguments from the State Government, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and individual employees who were impleaded in the petitions. The court reserved its judgment on September 21, 2017, and pronounced it on January 22, 2018.

In another writ petition, the petitioner alleged that the advertisement for the post was published without authority, and that the selection process was in violation of government policies and guidelines. The petitioner also claimed that the selection was carried out during the Code of Conduct for the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections, and that the MPCB appointed more candidates than advertised. The court heard the petitioner's submissions and ordered a detailed inquiry into the matter.

The court found that the MPCB had appointed over-age candidates, those with more than two children, and had not followed reservation policies for certain categories. The MPCB also did not follow the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board Employment Recruitment Rules, 1996, and did not prepare a roster since 2000. The court found that the selection process was conducted during the course of Code of Conduct based on oral permission alleged to have been obtained from the State Election Commission. The court found that the MPCB had committed a systematic and well-planned fraud while recruiting the large number of Field Officers and had committed gross violation of Government resolution and also the principles of law laid down by the Supreme Court and this court. The court made all the appointments made by the MPCB which are subject matter of this petition subject to the outcome of these petitions.

In another writ petition, the petitioner alleges that the entire selection procedure was fraudulent and manipulated by the MPCB to recruit a large number of persons, thereby depriving other eligible candidates. The petitioner also argues that the MPCB had already pre-determined the number and names of candidates who would be selected, and that the selection procedure violated various government resolutions and guidelines. The court order cites several judgments in support of the petitioner's submission.

The court found that no substantial prejudice was caused to the petitioners and that the selection committee had followed due procedure. The court also noted that all reservations, including female and handicapped reservations, had been granted. The court cited several judgments in support of its decision.

The court hears arguments from all parties and considers documents obtained through the Right to Information Act. The order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The court found that the MPCB had violated various rules and principles of law. The court set aside the selection procedure and all appointments made as a result of it. The court also noted that the appointees cannot claim any equity on the ground that they have been employed for more than eight years.

In conclusion, the court order summaries highlight the various writ petitions filed against the MPCB regarding the appointment of Field Officers. The court found that the selection process was conducted illegally and in violation of government resolutions and directions. The MPCB violated the Government Resolution and principles of law while appointing candidates to the post of Field Officer. The court declared the appointments to be ex facie illegal and contrary to law. The court ordered the entire selection process to be set aside and directed the authority to hold a new selection process. The court also noted that filling vacancies over the number advertised is a violation of constitutional rights and is only permissible in rare and exceptional circumstances.
