The fourth court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area. The petitioner and other mining lease holders deposited a sum of Rs.8,79,53,196/- on a pro-rata basis at the rate of Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare on 25.10.2017 under protest with the Mining Department.

The fifth court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the compensation amount, while the rest either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they were being asked to pay for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and the common area, which was being utilized by cluster members, and that the demand for the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) was contrary to law. The respondents argued that the status of the cluster had changed since the diversion and that some lease holders were not interested in extending the validity period of the diversion. The court considered various documents and submissions from both sides before reserving its judgment.

The sixth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) for the extension of validity period for approval under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, and approval was given for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs.17,59,06,000/- for the extension of the period of diversion proposal. Out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The seventh court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the government over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land that was diverted for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and thus, the approval was given for the entire area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra), and also such computation shall include the common
