The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case brought by Patel Bone Mill challenging an order from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to shift the bone mills outside the city due to complaints about foul smells. The court directed the petitioner to make an appeal to the Member Secretary of the GPCB if they were aggrieved by the order, and the Member Secretary would pass appropriate orders within a month. The court then discharged the notice.

The case was brought by Patel Bone Mill, which had been ordered by the GPCB to shift its operations outside the city due to complaints about foul smells. The company challenged the order in court, arguing that it had taken steps to reduce the odors and that the order was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately directed the petitioner to make an appeal to the Member Secretary of the GPCB if they were aggrieved by the order. The court also ordered that the Member Secretary pass appropriate orders within a month.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the GPCB had the authority to issue orders to control pollution, but that the orders must be reasonable and based on scientific evidence. The court found that the GPCB had not provided sufficient evidence to support its order to shift the bone mills outside the city.

The court's decision is significant because it reaffirms the importance of scientific evidence in environmental regulation. It also highlights the need for regulatory agencies to provide clear and reasonable orders that are based on sound science.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for environmental regulation in Gujarat. It ensures that regulatory agencies are held accountable for their decisions and that companies are given a fair opportunity to challenge those decisions if they believe they are unreasonable or arbitrary.
