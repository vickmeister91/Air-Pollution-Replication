The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Rajiv Bajaj against an order passed by the Appellate Court in Punjab. Bajaj had been convicted and sentenced to 15 days of simple imprisonment for violating the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Dissatisfied with the verdict, he filed an appeal and an application for additional evidence, which was adjourned by the Appellate Court.

Bajaj then challenged this order in the revision petition, but the court dismissed it as the order was interlocutory and legally barred from revision. This means that the order was not final and conclusive, and therefore could not be challenged through a revision petition.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to protect and conserve forests and wildlife in India. It lays down guidelines for the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, and mandates the prior approval of the central government for such diversion. Violations of the Act can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

In Bajaj's case, it appears that he had violated the Act by diverting forest land for non-forestry purposes without obtaining the necessary approvals. This led to his conviction and sentencing by the lower court.

However, Bajaj was not content with the verdict and sought to challenge it through an appeal and an application for additional evidence. The Appellate Court adjourned the matter, which prompted Bajaj to file a revision petition.

Unfortunately for Bajaj, the court dismissed his revision petition on the grounds that the order he was challenging was interlocutory and therefore not legally revisable. This means that Bajaj will have to accept the Appellate Court's decision and serve his sentence.

The dismissal of Bajaj's revision petition highlights the importance of understanding the legal system and the limitations of different types of orders. Interlocutory orders, which are not final and conclusive, cannot be challenged through revision petitions. Only final orders can be challenged through such petitions.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Rajiv Bajaj against an interlocutory order passed by the Appellate Court in Punjab. The court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the order was not legally revisable. This highlights the importance of understanding the legal system and the limitations of different types of orders.
