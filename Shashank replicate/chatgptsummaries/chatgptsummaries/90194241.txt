The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by R. Saras against various government officials in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner owns two buildings in Kodaikanal and had received notices alleging that the buildings were constructed illegally. The petitioner had filed a review petition, which was rejected, and had also filed a separate writ petition challenging the consequential action taken by the planning authority. 

The court held that the writ petition was not maintainable, but permitted the petitioner to submit a fresh application to the authority concerned in light of a modified master plan. The authorities were directed to consider the petitioner's case in accordance with the law and building norms. The court order states that the petitioner's building must comply with planning and building norms, and if authorities require structural alterations, the petitioner must make them. The petitioner cannot demand to keep the building intact if it violates planning norms. 

The authorities cannot pass stereotyped orders and must conduct spot inspections to ensure conformity with the law. The writ petition is dismissed as not maintainable, and the petitioner has three weeks to make a fresh application to the concerned authority. The application will be disposed of within six months, and until then, the impugned order will be kept in abeyance. The status quo will continue until orders are passed. The order is sent to various government officials.
