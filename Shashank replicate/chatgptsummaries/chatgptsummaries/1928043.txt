In a recent court case, a petitioner who was working as a Welfare Officer in a company filed a writ petition seeking a writ of Mandamus commanding the company not to terminate his services and to quash the order of termination. The petitioner argued that his services were governed by statutory provisions of service and his appointment was a statutory appointment, and therefore, his services could only be terminated in accordance with the statutory provisions. However, the respondent company argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as it was a public limited company and not discharging any public duty or function.

The court examined the case and held that the respondent company was not discharging any public duty or function and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable. The court also held that the Welfare Officers Recruitment & Conditions of Service Rules 1952 were a complete code by themselves and prescribed the minimum age and qualifications for a Welfare Officer, his duties and privileges, and the imposition of punishment, if any, with the concurrence of the Labour Commissioner. The court held that the status of a Welfare Officer was that of a senior executive of the factory and would be governed by the same rules in regard to dearness allowances, pension, P.F, leave, housing, medical and other facilities.

The court order further states that the appointment of a Welfare Officer in a factory is mandatory under certain conditions, but it does not mean that the company is discharging any public function or duty. The appointment is only incidental for running the factory. The court also mentions that a writ petition against a private company is not maintainable unless there is a breach of public duty.

The court examined the validity of the termination of a Welfare Officer's service and concluded that it was done in accordance with the contract of employment and not as a punishment, therefore, the notice of termination is legal. The writ petition was dismissed.

In summary, the court held that a writ petition against a private company is not maintainable unless there is a breach of public duty. The appointment of a Welfare Officer in a factory is mandatory under certain conditions, but it does not mean that the company is discharging any public function or duty. The Welfare Officers Recruitment & Conditions of Service Rules 1952 are a complete code by themselves and prescribe the minimum age and qualifications for a Welfare Officer, his duties and privileges, and the imposition of punishment, if any, with the concurrence of the Labour Commissioner. The court also examined the validity of the termination of a Welfare Officer's service and concluded that it was done in accordance with the contract of employment and not as a punishment, therefore, the notice of termination is legal.
