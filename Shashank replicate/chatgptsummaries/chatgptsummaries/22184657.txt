The Delhi High Court has recently issued several orders related to various cases. One of the cases is the sealing issue case filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India. The court heard applications seeking de-sealing of premises in this case. However, the court expressed its intention to dismiss the application but granted time until March 31, 2018, for the closing down of the office or demolishing the building. The court ordered the case to be listed on March 19, 2018.

In another case, the court has ordered the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to explain the basis for reducing the one-time conversion charge on construction from Rs. 89,094 per sq.m. to Rs. 22,274 per sq.m. The court has also asked for information on steps taken by the DDA and other civic agencies to ensure that construction is in accordance with environmental and fire safety regulations, availability of water and electricity supply, adequate footpaths, and parking areas. The DDA has been given two weeks to file an affidavit, and the case will be listed on March 28, 2018.

The court order states that the matter is adjourned as a copy of the application has not been served to the DDA and the applications are to be listed on 16.04.2018. The court also dismisses the applications made by the parties as they find no merit in them.

In another case, the court dismissed an application filed by Mawana Industries in a writ petition case. The court heard from both the petitioner and respondent's lawyers and adjourned the case to March 28, 2018, for further proceedings.

The sealing issue case filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India has been a long-standing issue in Delhi. The case pertains to the sealing of commercial establishments in residential areas in Delhi. The court had earlier ordered the sealing of such establishments, which had led to protests by traders and shopkeepers. The court had then set up a committee to look into the issue and suggest solutions. The committee had recommended that the sealing be stopped and a one-time conversion charge be levied on the establishments to regularize them. However, the court had later ordered the sealing to resume, leading to further protests.

In the current hearing, the court heard applications seeking de-sealing of premises in the case. The court expressed its intention to dismiss the application but granted time until March 31, 2018, for the closing down of the office or demolishing the building. The court ordered the case to be listed on March 19, 2018. This order is likely to have a significant impact on the traders and shopkeepers who are affected by the sealing.

In another case, the court has ordered the DDA to explain the basis for reducing the one-time conversion charge on construction from Rs. 89,094 per sq.m. to Rs. 22,274 per sq.m. The court has also asked for information on steps taken by the DDA and other civic agencies to ensure that construction is in accordance with environmental and fire safety regulations, availability of water and electricity supply, adequate footpaths, and parking areas. The DDA has been given two weeks to file an affidavit, and the case will be listed on March 28, 2018.

This order is likely to have a significant impact on the construction industry in Delhi. The reduction in the one-time conversion charge is expected to benefit builders and developers, who have been demanding a reduction in the charge for a long time. However, the court's order to ensure that construction is in accordance with environmental and fire safety regulations, availability of water and electricity supply, adequate footpaths, and parking areas is likely to increase the compliance burden on builders and developers.

In another case, the court dismissed an application filed by Mawana Industries in a writ petition case. The court heard from both the petitioner and respondent's lawyers and adjourned the case to March 28, 2018, for further proceedings. The details of the case are not clear from the court order.

Overall, the recent orders issued by the Delhi High Court are likely to have a significant impact on various stakeholders in Delhi. The sealing issue case is likely to affect traders and shopkeepers, while the order related to the one-time conversion charge is likely to affect builders and developers. The court's focus on ensuring compliance with environmental and fire safety regulations, availability of water and electricity supply, adequate footpaths, and parking areas is likely to increase the compliance burden on various stakeholders.
