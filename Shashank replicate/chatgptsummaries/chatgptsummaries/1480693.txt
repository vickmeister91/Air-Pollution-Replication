The two court orders pertain to writ petitions filed against private banks in India. The first case involves a retired employee of Bank of Madura Limited who sought direction from the court to pay him pension after the bank merged with ICICI Bank Limited. The question before the court was whether a writ petition is maintainable against a private bank and whether the employee was eligible for pension as per the bank's pension regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to various judgments, including those related to the nature of public duty and the circumstances under which a writ can be issued against private bodies. Ultimately, the court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature, and that the retired employee was eligible for pension as per the bank's pension regulations.

The second case involves an employee of a private bank whose service was terminated, and who challenged the bank's action through a writ petition. The court found that private companies carrying out banking activities do not discharge any public function or duty. They are subject to regulatory measures, but these do not confer any public status or obligation that can be enforced through a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also found that the employee was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the bank, and that the bank was not performing a public duty or function. The court further found that the employee was not eligible for pension under the bank's Pension Regulations, as he had retired before the relevant schemes came into effect. The court allowed the bank's appeal and set aside the writ petition.

The two court orders highlight the issue of whether private banks can be subject to writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution. Article 226 empowers high courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for any other purpose. The writs can be issued against any person or authority, including the government, for the enforcement of any legal right. However, the question arises whether private bodies, such as private banks, can be subject to writ petitions.

In the first case, the court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature. The court referred to various judgments, including the landmark judgment in the case of LIC vs. Escorts Ltd., where the Supreme Court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body if it is discharging a public function or performing a public duty. The court also referred to the judgment in the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, where the Supreme Court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body if it is discharging a public function or performing a public duty, and if the petitioner has a legal right to enforce.

In the second case, the court held that private companies carrying out banking activities do not discharge any public function or duty. The court referred to the judgment in the case of R.D. Shetty vs. International Airport Authority of India, where the Supreme Court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body if it is discharging a public function or performing a public duty, and if the petitioner has a legal right to enforce. The court found that the employee was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the bank, and that the bank was not performing a public duty or function.

The two court orders also highlight the issue of pension eligibility for employees of private banks. In the first case, the court held that the retired employee was eligible for pension as per the bank's pension regulations. In the second case, the court found that the employee was not eligible for pension under the bank's Pension Regulations, as he had retired before the relevant schemes came into effect.

In conclusion, the two court orders provide guidance on the issue of whether private banks can be subject to writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court held that a writ petition can be issued against a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature. The court also highlighted the issue of pension eligibility for employees of private banks.
