The court order pertains to a petition filed by Adarsh Muni Trivedi against the Union of India and others regarding the construction of a pond for the immersion of idols near the river Narmada. The National Green Tribunal had already disposed of the matter, and the court found that nothing further could be done. The Tribunal had directed the Pollution Control Boards to ensure that designated sites were earmarked for immersion and that guidelines were followed. The court ordered the removal of debris and material from the designated site of immersion and taken to the solid waste disposal site already earmarked for the purpose in accordance with the law. No further digging or excavation was to be carried out.

The court order requires steps to be taken to ensure the designated site for idol immersion is kept clean and free of pollution. The synthetic lining at the bottom of the pit must be removed within 48 hours of the immersion of idols. The respondents must comply with the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board. The petition has been disposed of and a copy of the order will be sent to the respondents for compliance. The matter has already been decided by the Green Tribunal, so the petition is finally disposed of.
