In a recent court case, an appeal filed by Smt Rangavva under Sections 299(E) of the Indian Succession Act was dismissed by the court. The appeal was filed against Smt Ratnavva, who claimed to be the wife of Parasappa Akkoji. Smt Rangavva had contested this claim and filed the appeal in question.

During the hearing, the appellants, Smt Rangavva and her representatives, were absent. This led the court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds of non-appearance. The court's decision was based on the fact that the appellants had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that Smt Ratnavva was not the legal wife of Parasappa Akkoji.

The Indian Succession Act is a law that governs the distribution of property and assets after the death of an individual. Section 299(E) of the Act deals with disputes related to the validity of a marriage. In this case, Smt Rangavva had challenged the validity of Smt Ratnavva's marriage to Parasappa Akkoji.

However, the court's decision to dismiss the appeal highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court. In the absence of such evidence, the court is likely to rule in favor of the party that has provided sufficient evidence to support their claim.

It is also worth noting that the Indian legal system places a high value on the principle of non-appearance. This means that if a party fails to appear in court, their case is likely to be dismissed. In this case, the absence of the appellants during the hearing was a key factor in the court's decision to dismiss the appeal.

Overall, this court case serves as a reminder of the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court. It also highlights the need for parties to appear in court when required, as failure to do so can result in the dismissal of their case.
