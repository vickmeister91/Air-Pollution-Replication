The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to eviction cases under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. In the first order, the petitioner, who is the owner of a shop, seeks eviction of the respondent who is occupying the shop on the grounds of personal requirement. The respondent has filed an application for leave to defend, claiming that the petitioner does not require the premises bona-fide and that he is not the owner/landlord of the premises. The court has heard both parties and has decided to grant leave to contest the eviction application as the respondent has raised triable issues. The court has emphasized the importance of natural justice and the need to grant leave to defend when a triable issue is raised.

In the second court order, the court discusses the granting of leave to defend in a case where a landlord is seeking possession of a property. The court emphasizes that the denial of leave to defend denies the party seeking leave the opportunity to test the truth of the opposite party's averments through cross-examination. The court also notes that the burden is on the landlord to prove their requirements and that the assertion must be tested, especially when the landlord has a building in their name where they receive correspondence. The court cites relevant provisions of Act 59 of 1958 and a decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to explain the Rent Controller's role in deciding whether to grant leave to contest. The court also addresses the tenant's denial of the landlord's ownership of the property and concludes that the petitioner is the owner/landlord and that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. Finally, the court addresses the respondent's contention that the petitioner already has sufficient accommodation available and notes that the respondent has failed to disclose any information about the accommodation available with the petitioner.

In the third court order, the court has dismissed the respondent's leave to defend application as the petitioner is the owner and landlord of the premises and has the right to judge their necessity. The petitioner has pleaded a bona fide requirement for the premises due to the increasing needs of their family and business activities. The court found no triable issue between the parties and allowed the application for eviction. The petitioner is entitled to recover possession of the premises, but the order cannot be executed for six months. There is no order as to costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of natural justice and the need to grant leave to defend when a triable issue is raised. The burden is on the landlord to prove their requirements and assertions must be tested, especially when the landlord has a building in their name where they receive correspondence. The court also emphasizes the importance of disclosing information about available accommodation when a tenant is contesting an eviction application. In cases where the landlord has a bona fide requirement for the premises, the court may grant an application for eviction, but the order cannot be executed for a certain period of time.
