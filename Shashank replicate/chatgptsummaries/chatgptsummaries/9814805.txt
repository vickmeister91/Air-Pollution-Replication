The Patna High Court has recently issued an order regarding the release of Pretam Kumar, who is facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules. The court has ordered that Kumar be released on bail upon his arrest or surrender within 30 days of the court order. The bail amount has been set at Rs. 20,000 with two sureties of the same amount. Additionally, the petitioner must cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case.

The order comes in response to a petition filed by Kumar seeking bail in the case. The petitioner had argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and that there was no evidence against him. He had also contended that he was suffering from various health issues and that he needed to be released on bail to receive proper medical treatment.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court observed that the petitioner had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or that he would tamper with the evidence. The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and that he had no criminal antecedents.

Taking these factors into consideration, the court granted bail to the petitioner. However, the court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioner. The petitioner must cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case and must not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses. The petitioner must also surrender his passport, if any, and must not leave the country without the permission of the court.

The court also directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 with two sureties of the same amount. The sureties must be residents of the local area and must provide proof of their residence. The sureties must also undertake to ensure that the petitioner appears before the court as and when required.

The court further directed the petitioner to report to the investigating officer once a week and to attend the court on all hearing dates. The petitioner must also inform the investigating officer of any change in his address or contact details.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted bail to Pretam Kumar, who is facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules. The court has imposed certain conditions on the petitioner, including a bail amount of Rs. 20,000 with two sureties of the same amount, cooperation with the investigation and trial of the case, and surrender of his passport. The petitioner must also report to the investigating officer once a week and attend the court on all hearing dates.
