The case of Shri David D'Souza revolves around the construction of a structure on a property in Goa without obtaining the necessary permissions. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority had issued a notice to the petitioner to demolish the structure, which was found to be in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991. The petitioner had argued that the structure did not fall within the prohibited zone, but the court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it with costs.

The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991 was enacted to regulate development activities in the coastal areas of India. The notification divides the coastal zone into different categories, namely, the CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III, and CRZ-IV. The CRZ-I is the most restricted zone, and it includes areas that are ecologically sensitive, such as mangroves, coral reefs, and turtle nesting grounds. The CRZ-II includes areas that are developed or urbanized, such as cities and towns. The CRZ-III includes areas that are relatively undisturbed, such as rural areas and villages. The CRZ-IV includes areas that are designated as aquatic zones, such as creeks, estuaries, and backwaters.

In the case of Shri David D'Souza, the court found that the structure was constructed in the CRZ-I zone, which is the most restricted zone. The petitioner had argued that the structure was constructed in the CRZ-II zone, which is less restricted than the CRZ-I zone. However, the court found that the structure was constructed in the intertidal zone, which is a part of the CRZ-I zone. The intertidal zone is the area between the high tide and low tide marks, and it is considered to be ecologically sensitive.

The court also found that the petitioner had constructed the structure without obtaining the necessary permissions from the authorities. The petitioner had argued that he had applied for the necessary permissions, but the authorities had not responded to his application. However, the court found that the petitioner had not submitted the necessary documents and had not paid the necessary fees for obtaining the permissions.

The court, therefore, ordered the petitioner to demolish the structure within a period of six months. The court also ordered the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 1 lakh for violating the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991. The court further ordered the petitioner to pay the costs of the proceedings.

The case of Shri David D'Souza highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions before undertaking any development activities in the coastal areas of India. The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991 is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the fragile coastal ecosystem of India. The notification provides a framework for regulating development activities in the coastal areas and ensures that the development is sustainable and does not harm the environment.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Shri David D'Souza reinforces the importance of complying with the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991. The notification is a crucial tool for protecting the coastal ecosystem of India, and it is essential that all stakeholders, including developers and authorities, adhere to its provisions. The court's decision also sends a strong message that violations of the notification will not be tolerated and that the consequences of such violations can be severe.
