The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases under the Bengal Money-lenders Act, which provides for the reopening of transactions and decrees related to loans, both before and after the commencement of the law. The Act aims to protect borrowers against rapacious moneylenders and requires the court to give full relief to borrowers.

In the first case, a borrower named Mittra had mortgaged four parcels of land to a money-lender named Mondal for a loan of Rs. 2,500. Mondal obtained a preliminary and final mortgage decree against Mittra and a personal decree for the remaining debt. Mittra filed a suit under the Bengal Money-lenders Act, 1940, to reopen the personal decree, which was granted, and a new decree was passed for a smaller amount. However, Mittra failed to pay the instalments, and Mondal applied for executing the decree. Mittra then filed another suit under the Act to reopen the preliminary and final decrees, which was dismissed by the Subordinate Judge as res judicata. The High Court reversed the decision and directed the decrees to be reopened. The Supreme Court held that the Act contemplates the filing of one suit for reopening transactions, and if the borrower fails to seek the entire relief, he cannot seek it in another suit. The court also held that the principle of res judicata applies to a suit under the Act.

The second case also involves a borrower who had obtained a loan from a money-lender and subsequently defaulted on payments. The money-lender had obtained a decree against the borrower, which was partially satisfied through the sale of mortgaged properties. The borrower then filed an application under section 36 of the Act to reopen the decree and obtain relief. The court partially allowed the application and passed a new decree for a reduced amount. The borrower appealed, and the case went through several rounds of litigation. The court ultimately held that the borrower could not file successive suits for relief under section 36 and that the right to claim relief not asked for in a previous suit must be regarded as res judicata. The court also clarified the scope of the powers conferred by section 36 to reopen decrees and provide relief to borrowers.

The third case discusses the provisions of the Bengal Money-lenders Act in general and emphasizes the need to protect borrowers against rapacious moneylenders. The court ultimately dismisses the appeal and upholds the protection of borrowers under the law.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of the Bengal Money-lenders Act in protecting borrowers from unscrupulous moneylenders. The Act provides for the reopening of transactions and decrees related to loans, both before and after the commencement of the law, and requires the court to give full relief to borrowers. However, the court also emphasizes that the Act contemplates the filing of one suit for reopening transactions, and the principle of res judicata applies to a suit under the Act. Borrowers cannot file successive suits for relief under section 36, and the right to claim relief not asked for in a previous suit must be regarded as res judicata.
