The State of Haryana had filed a petition challenging the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissing their application to recall a witness for the purpose of proving a notification that banned a book written by the respondent. However, the court dismissed the petition as a fresh application had been filed to summon an officer to prove the relevant documents and subsequent notification, which was yet to be considered by the court.

The case in question pertains to a notification that was issued on September 27, 2001, banning a book written by the respondent. The State of Haryana had sought to prove the validity of this notification by recalling a witness. However, their application was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.

The State of Haryana then filed a petition challenging this order. However, the court dismissed the petition as a fresh application had been filed to summon an officer to prove the relevant documents and subsequent notification, which was yet to be considered by the court.

It is important to note that the judgment dated 11.11.2008 in CWP No. 8045 of 2002 quashed the notification dated September 27, 2001. This means that the notification banning the book written by the respondent was no longer valid.

Following this judgment, a fresh notification was issued on 15.12.2008. It is unclear what the contents of this notification were, but it is likely that it pertained to the same book that was banned earlier.

In conclusion, the State of Haryana's petition challenging the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate was dismissed as a fresh application had been filed to summon an officer to prove the relevant documents and subsequent notification, which was yet to be considered by the court. It is important to note that the judgment dated 11.11.2008 in CWP No. 8045 of 2002 quashed the notification dated September 27, 2001, and a fresh notification was issued on 15.12.2008.
