In a recent case, the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.3, Badi, Dholpur, which refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of a case registered at Police Station Sadar, Badi, Dholpur, for offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29/51 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the alleged offences and were not required for the purpose of investigation or trial. The petitioner further contended that the tractor and trolley were his only source of livelihood and their detention was causing him immense financial hardship.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The court held that the tractor and trolley were not required for the purpose of investigation or trial and their continued detention was causing undue hardship to the petitioner.

The court directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner on the condition that he furnishes a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond in the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) with two solvent sureties, each of the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court. The court further directed that the petitioner and the sureties shall undertake to produce the tractor and trolley before the trial court as and when required and shall not dispose of the same without the permission of the trial court.

The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. The court also directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner forthwith upon the furnishing of the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds.

In conclusion, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley to the petitioner subject to the conditions mentioned above. The court held that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was causing undue hardship to the petitioner and that their release would not prejudice the investigation or trial of the case.
