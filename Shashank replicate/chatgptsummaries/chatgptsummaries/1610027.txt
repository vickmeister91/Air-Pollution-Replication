Salman Khan, a well-known Bollywood actor, filed a petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. against the order passed by the Officer In charge (Copying Sec), District and Sessions Court, Jodhpur and the impugned order passed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division) and Judicial Magistrate, Jodhpur. The petition was filed in relation to a criminal case in which the accused had requested a duplicate copy of a video cassette to be used for cross-examination of witnesses. The trial judge had rejected the application, stating that the court could not obtain a duplicate copy of the video cassette.

The court found that the reasons assigned by the trial judge for dismissing the application were wholly unsustainable. The court held that the accused had a right to cross-examine the witnesses and that the video cassette was necessary for the purpose of cross-examination. The court granted the accused's request for a duplicate copy of the video cassette and directed the trial judge to provide the duplicate copy to the accused at his own cost.

The court also directed the trial judge to seal the original cassette and keep it in his custody. The court held that the original cassette was an important piece of evidence and needed to be preserved. The court further directed the trial judge to ensure that the original cassette was not tampered with in any way.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the right of the accused to cross-examine witnesses and to have access to evidence that is necessary for the purpose of cross-examination. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the field of criminal law. The decision upholds the rights of the accused and emphasizes the importance of preserving evidence in criminal cases. The decision is likely to have a positive impact on the administration of justice in India.
