The National Green Tribunal heard two appeals, No. 68 and 69 of 2012, regarding the State Pollution Control Board, Odisha, and two companies, M/s Swastik Ispat Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Patnaik Steel & Alloys Ltd. The Board introduced a bank guarantee system for defaulting industries to install necessary pollution control equipment or upgrade existing systems. In Appeal 68 of 2012, the Board granted consent to operate under the Air Act for Respondent Unit's Sponge Iron plant, but later issued a closure notice due to deficiencies found during an inspection. The Tribunal disposed of both appeals with a common order.

In another case, the court order pertains to a case where the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had asked an industry to furnish a performance bank guarantee for non-compliance with environmental regulations. The industry had furnished the guarantee but later challenged the Board's decision to forfeit it. The Board argued that it had the power to ask for a bank guarantee as a regulatory and compensatory measure to ensure compliance with environmental standards. The industry argued that the Board did not have the power to ask for a bank guarantee and that the encashment of the guarantee was not in accordance with the terms of the guarantee. The CPCB supported the Board's decision and argued that the industry had been a persistent defaulter and needed to make good any damage caused to the environment. The court ultimately upheld the Board's decision to ask for a bank guarantee and forfeit it.

The court order discusses a case of an industrial unit that was non-compliant with environmental standards. The State Board required a bank guarantee from the unit to achieve compliance within a reasonable time frame. The unit was inspected multiple times and found to have not complied with the requirements. The Board issued show cause notices and granted extensions of time, but the unit still did not comply. The Board decided to invoke the bank guarantee and refused to return it to the unit. The court order details the various deficiencies found in the unit's compliance with environmental standards.

In another case, the court order discusses a case where an industry failed to comply with environmental norms and recommendations within the scheduled time-frame. The State Pollution Control Board asked the State Bank of India to forfeit the bank guarantee, and the industry filed an appeal before the appellate authority. The order raises several issues that require determination by the Tribunal, including whether the decision of the Board requiring industrial units to furnish bank guarantee is without jurisdiction, whether the invocation of the bank guarantee by the State Board on the alleged breach is penal and thus impermissible under the provisions of the Air Act and the Water Act, and whether the order of the appellate authority suffers from the infirmity of taking into consideration irrelevant matters and grounds. The order also discusses the functions and powers of the Boards under the Air Act and the Water Act.

The court order discusses the functions and powers of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Boards in preventing, controlling, and abating air pollution in India. The CPCB is responsible for coordinating activities, providing training, collecting data, and laying down air quality standards. The State Boards advise the government on the suitability of industrial locations and inspect air pollution control areas. The Air Act requires every state government to declare air pollution control areas and issue notifications. The Board has the power to issue directions, including closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry or operation, and stoppage or regulation of supply of water, electricity, or any other service to the industrial plant. The Board can also inspect industrial units and take air emission samples to ensure compliance with prescribed standards. Failure to comply with the provisions of the Air Act can result in imprisonment and fines. The court emphasizes that the powers of the Board should be construed liberally to achieve the purpose of the Act, which is to prevent and control pollution and provide a clean and healthy environment.

The court order explains that the Board has the power to issue regulatory directions to ensure anti-pollution measures are adopted by industries. The Board may require a bank guarantee from an industry to provide an incentive to install anti-pollution devices and to spend money on remedial purposes in case of default resulting in pollution. The condition of furnishing a bank guarantee is compensatory, not penal, and falls within the ambit of statutory powers vested in the Board. The Air Act provides for both penalty and compensatory concepts, and the Board must ensure prevention and control of pollution while keeping in mind sustainable development, polluter pays principle, and precautionary principle. The word "compensation" means anything given to make things equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of.

The court order discusses the distinction between penalty and compensation in environmental law. It states that compensatory relief is intended to provide equal value for losses sustained, while penalties are punitive in nature. The order also discusses the power of expert bodies to provide opportunities for compliance before taking harsher steps, such as closure. The use of bank guarantees as a condition for compliance is permissible and not considered penal in nature. The order distinguishes this case from previous cases involving fiscal laws and emphasizes the need for a purposive construction in environmental law.

The court order discusses the difference between penal and compensatory actions in relation to environmental regulations. The court concludes that requiring a bank guarantee as an interim measure for due performance of the conditions of a consent order is compensatory in nature and not punitive. The court also distinguishes between compensation
