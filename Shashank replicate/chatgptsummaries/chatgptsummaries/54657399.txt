The court has issued three separate orders related to outdoor advertising in Madhya Pradesh. The first order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Devendra Kumar Khare against the Urban Development Department for allegedly violating the Madhya Pradesh Outdoors Advertising Media Rules, 2017 while allotting sites for advertisement. The petitioner contends that no advertisement can be placed on BRTS and MG Road. The court refers to a previous case, Parvez Iqbal v/s State of Madhya Pradesh & Others (W.P. No.22797/2018), where the issue of hazardous hoardings obstructing free flow of traffic was settled. The court had held that such hoardings must be removed. The current case is similar in nature, and the court will decide whether the respondents have violated the previous order.

The second court order states that the Municipal Corporation has the power to prohibit the erection of hoardings on private houses or walls. The Commissioner of Municipal Corporation, Indore has been directed to remove all hoardings that are hazardous and a disturbance to safe traffic movement. The Municipal Corporation has been directed to file an affidavit stating that they will not grant any license to put hoardings on roadsides, except for traffic signs and road signs. The court has dismissed the writ appeals on merit, stating that the appellants have no right to continue with the hoardings when no permission for renewal of license was granted. The court has also referred to the Madhya Pradesh Outdoor Advertising Media Rules, 2017, which provide for no hoarding zones and restrictions on negative outdoor advertisement. The court has directed the Commissioner to issue notice to the licensees and take appropriate action under the 2017 Rules before any coercive action is taken. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the individual cases.

The third court order outlines rules for outdoor advertisements, including prohibiting ads that promote drugs, alcohol, tobacco, exploitation of women or children, sexual overtones, cruelty to animals, anti-national activities, defamation, and more. The order also states that no hoarding or outdoor media device can be erected in prohibited areas. The court finds no reason to interfere with a tender issued by the Atal Indore City Transport Services Limited for advertisement rights, as it is in accordance with the rules. The case is dismissed.

In summary, the court has issued three orders related to outdoor advertising in Madhya Pradesh. The first order pertains to a PIL filed against the Urban Development Department for allegedly violating the Madhya Pradesh Outdoors Advertising Media Rules, 2017. The second order directs the Municipal Corporation to remove hazardous hoardings and prohibits the granting of licenses for hoardings on roadsides. The third order outlines rules for outdoor advertisements, including prohibiting certain types of ads and the erection of hoardings in prohibited areas. The court finds no reason to interfere with a tender issued by the Atal Indore City Transport Services Limited for advertisement rights.
