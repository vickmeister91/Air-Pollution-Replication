The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by M/S B. Byrappa and Sons and M/S Gyathri Stone Products against the State of Karnataka, the Department of Mines and Geology, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the Deputy Commissioner of Bangalore Urban District, the Managing Director of Bangalore Electricity Supply Company, and the Secretary of Sonnappanahalli Village Panchayat. The petitioners sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and to direct the competent authority to consider their application to operate their stone crushing unit.

The court found that the petitioners were valid licensees and that their licenses were valid to run the stone crushing units. The court also found that the issues raised in this writ petition were similar to those raised in a previous writ petition, and therefore, the court followed the decision of the Division Bench in that case. The court allowed the petitioners to continue their stone crushing activity until their application for re-locating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority.

The court order states that the Pollution Control Board cannot grant permission for a petitioner to operate in its current site due to safety concerns and the need to relocate to a safer zone. However, the court has allowed the petition and quashed a previous order, directing the respondents to permit operation of the stone crushing unit at the present site until the application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks. There will be no order as to costs.

The court's decision is significant as it allows the petitioners to continue their stone crushing activity until their application for re-locating the unit to a safer zone is disposed of by the competent authority. This decision is important as it recognizes the rights of the petitioners as valid licensees and allows them to continue their business activities until a final decision is made on their application.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of safety concerns and the need to relocate to a safer zone. The Pollution Control Board cannot grant permission for a petitioner to operate in its current site due to safety concerns, and the court has recognized this fact. The court's decision emphasizes the need for businesses to prioritize safety concerns and take necessary steps to ensure the safety of their employees and the environment.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive development for the petitioners and recognizes their rights as valid licensees. The decision also highlights the importance of safety concerns and the need to relocate to a safer zone. The court's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the safety of employees and the environment and promoting responsible business practices.
