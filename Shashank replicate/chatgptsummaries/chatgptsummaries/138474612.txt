In a recent court order, a petition filed by Smt. Deepika Singh under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the court. The petitioner had requested the court to expedite the trial pending before the trial court. However, the court found that no delay had been caused in the trial unnecessarily, and therefore, no direction could be given to the trial court.

The court also stated that it was not a case in which inherent powers of the court could be invoked in favor of the applicant. The inherent powers of the court are those powers that are not specifically provided for by law but are necessary for the proper functioning of the court. These powers are derived from the principle that the court is the guardian of justice and has the duty to prevent abuse of its process.

In this case, the court found that there was no abuse of the court's process and that the trial was proceeding in a timely manner. Therefore, the court could not invoke its inherent powers in favor of the applicant.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial was not being delayed unnecessarily. The court found that the trial was proceeding in a timely manner and that there was no reason to expedite it further. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to suggest that the trial was being delayed intentionally or that there was any other reason to expedite it.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that the petitioner had not provided any legal basis for her request. The court noted that the petitioner had not cited any provision of law that would require the trial court to expedite the trial. Therefore, the court found that there was no legal basis for the petitioner's request.

Finally, the court ordered that a copy of the order be sent to the courts below for information and compliance. This means that the lower courts will be informed of the court's decision and will be required to comply with it.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the fact that there was no delay in the trial and that there was no legal basis for the petitioner's request. The court also found that it was not a case in which its inherent powers could be invoked in favor of the applicant. The court's decision was communicated to the lower courts for compliance.
