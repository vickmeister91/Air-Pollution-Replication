The Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board filed a complaint against South Eastern Coal Fields Limited and its Chief General Manager for violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioners challenged the order taking cognizance of the offence, arguing that the complaint was filed by an unauthorized person and that there was no averment that the Chief General Manager was directly responsible for the company's conduct of business. The court considered whether the complaint was bad for non-compliance of Section 19(a) of the Act of 1986 and whether it was liable to be rejected for non-compliance of Section 16(1) of the Act of 1986. The court found that the complaint was authorized by a notification issued by the Central Government and that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of Section 16(1).

The court order discusses a notification issued by the Central Government in 1987, authorizing Regional Officers of State Boards to exercise powers under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court confirms that the Regional Officer of the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board is authorized to file a complaint under Section 19(a) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The order also discusses Section 16 of the Act, which creates a legal fiction whereby every person in charge of and responsible for a company's conduct of business becomes automatically guilty of any offence committed by the company. The court considers whether specific language is necessary in a complaint to make it maintainable under Section 16.

The court order discusses the application of Section 47(1) and the burden of proof on those responsible for a company's conduct. The court rejects the argument that rules of evidence and deeming fictions must be expressly pleaded in a complaint. The order cites previous cases that emphasize the importance of strict enforcement of laws related to pollution and the right to a clean environment. The court also examines the complaint in the present case and finds that it adequately establishes the responsibility of the petitioner for the company's conduct.

The court order pertains to a case where a company and its Chief General Manager are accused of violating provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
