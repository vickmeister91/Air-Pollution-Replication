The Central Administrative Tribunal in Delhi recently heard a case brought by Sh. Pradeep Mathur and 260 other applicants against the Central Pollution Control Board and other government entities. The applicants sought to be included in the GPF-cum-Pension Scheme, which was recommended by the Fourth Pay Commission in 1986. The respondents argued that the applicants were not eligible for the scheme and that the Fourth Pay Commission had not recommended it for employees of autonomous bodies. 

After hearing both sides, the Tribunal ultimately ruled in favor of the applicants. The Tribunal cited a previous judgment in a similar case and the interpretation of an office memorandum by the Supreme Court. The Ministry of Finance was directed to provide financial sanction for the introduction of the scheme for all employees appointed prior to 2004.

The court ordered Respondent No.1 to provide a Pension Scheme to all employees appointed before 01.01.2004, similar to employees of Autonomous Bodies, within 2 months of receiving the order. Within 1 month, Respondent No.1 must ensure that eligible employees receive the benefits of the scheme. The court has allowed the O.A. and granted relief to the applicants, following the time schedule of a previous judgment. No costs were awarded.

The ruling is significant as it provides relief to a large number of government employees who were previously excluded from the GPF-cum-Pension Scheme. The scheme was recommended by the Fourth Pay Commission in 1986 and was meant to provide financial security to government employees after their retirement. However, the scheme was not extended to employees of autonomous bodies, which led to a lot of confusion and dissatisfaction among government employees.

The ruling of the Central Administrative Tribunal in Delhi is based on the interpretation of an office memorandum by the Supreme Court. The memorandum stated that the GPF-cum-Pension Scheme should be extended to all government employees, including those of autonomous bodies. The Tribunal also cited a previous judgment in a similar case, which had ruled in favor of the employees.

The ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the financial security of government employees who were previously excluded from the scheme. The Pension Scheme will provide them with a regular income after their retirement, which will help them to meet their financial needs. The ruling will also help to address the issue of inequality among government employees, as all employees will now be eligible for the scheme.

The Ministry of Finance has been directed to provide financial sanction for the introduction of the scheme for all employees appointed prior to 2004. This will ensure that all eligible employees receive the benefits of the scheme within the stipulated time frame. The ruling has been welcomed by government employees, who have been fighting for their rights for a long time.

In conclusion, the ruling of the Central Administrative Tribunal in Delhi is a significant step towards ensuring the financial security of government employees. The Pension Scheme will provide them with a regular income after their retirement, which will help them to meet their financial needs. The ruling will also help to address the issue of inequality among government employees, as all employees will now be eligible for the scheme. The Ministry of Finance has been directed to provide financial sanction for the introduction of the scheme for all employees appointed prior to 2004, which will ensure that all eligible employees receive the benefits of the scheme within the stipulated time frame.
