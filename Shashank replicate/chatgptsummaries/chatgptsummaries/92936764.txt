The Central Information Commission (CIC) recently ordered the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and the President of the Wellington Gymkhana Club to submit documents related to the allocation of land, recognition, registration, and certification granted to the club, audit reports of balance sheets for the last five years, and lists of members and pending membership applications. The order came in response to an appeal filed by a retired civil servant who alleged a lack of transparency in the club's administration and wrongful refusal of his membership application. The club claimed that it was not a public authority under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The CIC directed both parties to exchange documents and submit them before the next hearing. In a subsequent order, the CIC declared that the Wellington Gymkhana Club in Ooty is a public authority under the RTI Act and must designate officers as Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) and First Appellate Authority, create an RTI wing, provide necessary infrastructural facilities, and train staff in RTI Act and practices. The club must also comply with the obligation under Section 4 of the RTI Act by publishing information of all categorizations as prescribed under Section 4(1)(b)(c) and (d) within 14 days. The respondent authority must provide a certified copy of the lease deed and all other information as directed to the appellant within 14 days from the date of receipt of this order.

The order is significant as it establishes the Wellington Gymkhana Club as a public authority under the RTI Act, which means that it is subject to the transparency and accountability provisions of the Act. The CIC's order also highlights the importance of transparency in the administration of private clubs that receive public land and other benefits from the government.
