The Patna High Court recently issued a public interest litigation order regarding the failure of the Patna Municipal Corporation to establish an incinerator plant for solid waste management on 80 acres of acquired land. The court called upon the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar to ensure that necessary clearance from the Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India, and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board is issued within two weeks. If clearance is not obtained within the given time, the court will have no option but to stay further deposit of garbage over the lands in question.

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by a group of concerned citizens who had raised concerns about the lack of proper waste management in the city. The petitioners had argued that the failure of the Patna Municipal Corporation to establish an incinerator plant for solid waste management was leading to the accumulation of garbage in the city, which was causing serious health hazards for the residents.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the petitioners and the respondents, observed that the issue of solid waste management was a matter of public interest and that the failure of the Patna Municipal Corporation to establish an incinerator plant for solid waste management was a serious lapse on their part. The court noted that the Patna Municipal Corporation had acquired 80 acres of land for the purpose of establishing an incinerator plant for solid waste management, but had failed to obtain the necessary clearances from the Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India, and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.

The court, therefore, called upon the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar to ensure that necessary clearance from the Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India, and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board is issued within two weeks. The court also directed the Patna Municipal Corporation to deposit a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs as a security deposit with the court, which would be forfeited if the necessary clearances were not obtained within the given time.

The court further observed that if the necessary clearances were not obtained within the given time, it would have no option but to stay further deposit of garbage over the lands in question. The court noted that the accumulation of garbage in the city was causing serious health hazards for the residents and that it was the duty of the Patna Municipal Corporation to ensure that proper waste management was in place.

The court also directed the Patna Municipal Corporation to file a status report within four weeks, detailing the steps taken by them to establish an incinerator plant for solid waste management. The court noted that the issue of solid waste management was a matter of public interest and that the Patna Municipal Corporation had a duty to ensure that proper waste management was in place.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's order regarding the failure of the Patna Municipal Corporation to establish an incinerator plant for solid waste management on 80 acres of acquired land is a welcome step towards ensuring proper waste management in the city. The court's direction to the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar to ensure that necessary clearance from the Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India, and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board is issued within two weeks is a positive development. The court's observation that the issue of solid waste management is a matter of public interest and that the Patna Municipal Corporation has a duty to ensure that proper waste management is in place is a reminder to all concerned authorities that they have a responsibility towards the citizens of the city.
