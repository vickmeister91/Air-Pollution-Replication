The case in question involves M/S. Entrack International Trading Pvt. Ltd., which imported watch straps made of ostrich, calf, and alligator leather. The Customs House Agent filed a Bill of Entry based on two invoices, and the respondent declared 513 and 600 watch straps respectively. The goods were examined and it was found that the leather straps of ostrich and alligator were restricted in terms of licensing note to Chapter 1 of ITC (HS) and that the permission of the wildlife authorities was required for their clearance.

The case went through various levels of appeal, and the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), New Delhi allowed the appeal and directed the lower authorities to return the consignment included 25 pieces imported in excess of the declaration to the respondent and after assessing the same to customs duty. The Union of India filed an appeal challenging the order of the Appellate Tribunal.

The court order states that certain goods can be imported with a CITES Export Permit from the country of origin, a CITES Import Permit issued by the jurisdictional Wildlife Authority, or a No Objection Certificate issued by Wildlife Officers. In this case, the required permits were not available, and the confiscation of the goods was deemed unassailable. The court also found that the lower authorities were in error in treating the import as a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act and CITES.

The court dismissed the appeal and allowed the respondent to clear the goods subject to the payment of a paltry sum of Rs.52,914/-. The court order allows the respondent to clear goods by paying a duty of 914/- in the interest of justice. The appeal is dismissed as there is no merit in it. The order was given on October 30, 2009.
