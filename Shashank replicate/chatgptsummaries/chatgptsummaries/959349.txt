The court order pertains to a dispute between Kakateeya Nagar Co-operative Housing Society Limited and others against the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Uppal Kalan Municipality, Osmania University, Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, M/s. Ajay Constructions, and others. The writ petition sought a writ of mandamus declaring the order of the Commissioner of Uppal Kalan Municipality permitting M/s. Ajay Constructions to connect and drain out the water flowing from the soakage pit of the building to the existing drain at Habshiguda as being void and illegal. The court heard the matter and directed a committee to go into certain technical aspects of the matter before passing any final order.

The court order discusses a case involving the connection of a sewerage line from a construction company's flats to an underground pipeline in Habshiguda. A committee was formed to investigate the matter and submitted a report with recommendations for short-term and long-term measures to eradicate the nuisance and ensure health, hygiene, and environment in the area. However, the report was criticized by expert bodies and the Osmania University, who argued that the recommendations were vague and impractical. The legal question at hand is whether the Municipality had the authority to permit the connection of the sewerage line, with one side arguing that it was within their obligation to provide and maintain a sufficient system of public drains, while the other side argues that the action was illegal and led to environmental pollution.

The court examines the permit conditions imposed on Ajay Constructions and finds that they have committed a serious violation by not adhering to the specifications laid down by HUDA. The court also cites cases that establish the absolute liability of those engaged in construction work not to commit nuisance by letting out effluent from their drainage system. The court concludes that M/s. Ajay Constructions cannot be allowed to regularize a patent illegality committed by them by connecting their sewerage pipeline to the underground municipal pipeline of Habshiguda for discharging the offensive material.

The court order states that M/s. Ajay Constructions violated the permit condition for construction of flats by connecting their sewerage pipeline to the underground municipal pipeline of Habshiguda for discharging offensive material. The court quashes the permission granted by the Municipality and directs M/s. Ajay Constructions to ensure that septic tanks and soakage pits become operational and no discharge is let out from their premises into the outside area. The Municipality is directed not to disconnect the sewage pipeline for a month, after which the sewage pipeline shall be severed by the Municipality. The residents of the flats are responsible for removing the sewerage/sullage from their septic tanks/soakage pits. The court allows Writ Appeal No. 1338/89 filed by the Osmania University and dismisses Writ Appeal No. 811/89 filed by M/s. Ajay Constructions.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between Kakateeya Nagar Co-operative Housing Society Limited and others against the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Uppal Kalan Municipality, Osmania University, Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, M/s.
