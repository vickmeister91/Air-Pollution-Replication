The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant, Sharafat Khan, challenged the dismissal of his application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and Sections 45 and 47 of the Evidence Act by the trial court. The applicant had requested that the impugned cheques be examined by a handwriting expert, but the trial court dismissed the application. The court considered the submissions made by both parties and concluded that the handwriting expert's examination was not necessary as the applicant had accepted that he had appended his signature on the cheques.

The court noted that the examination of handwriting is not a perfect science and that no handwriting expert can claim to give the age of ink by which the entries were filled up. The court also observed that the applicant had not raised any doubts about the authenticity of his signature on the cheques. Therefore, the court held that the trial court had rightly dismissed the application for examination of the cheques by a handwriting expert.

The applicant had also filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the order of the trial court dismissing his application for examination of the cheques by a handwriting expert. The court dismissed the applicant's petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and vacated the interim stay.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of accepting responsibility for one's actions. In this case, the applicant had accepted that he had appended his signature on the cheques, and therefore, there was no need for a handwriting expert's examination. The court also emphasized that the examination of handwriting is not a perfect science and that no handwriting expert can claim to give the age of ink by which the entries were filled up.

Furthermore, the court's decision also underscores the importance of following due process of law. The applicant had filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the order of the trial court dismissing his application for examination of the cheques by a handwriting expert. However, the court dismissed the applicant's petition and vacated the interim stay, thereby upholding the trial court's decision.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that accepting responsibility for one's actions and following due process of law are essential components of a fair and just legal system.
