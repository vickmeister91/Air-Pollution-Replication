The Gujarat High Court recently heard a group of seven Criminal Revision Applications related to proceedings under Section 33 of the Water [Prevention & Control of Pollution] Act, 1974. The case involved the interpretation of Section 33 of the Act and the expression "to desist from taking such action as is likely to cause pollution" appearing in Clause (i) of Sub-section (3) of Section 33 of the Act. The Petitioner-Gujarat Water Pollution Control Board had filed several complaints against the respondents for contravening provisions of Sections 25 and 26 of the Act. The Board had also filed several applications under Section 33, praying for restraining the respondents from polluting the river "Modhiba". 

The learned Magistrate had passed an ad-interim order restraining the respondents from discharging the alleged effluent water outside their factory compound until further orders. The learned Magistrate confirmed the ad-interim relief granted earlier and ordered to continue the same till final disposal of the criminal cases. The respondents preferred Criminal Revision Applications before the Court of the learned Sessions Judge, Surat which came to be partly allowed by the impugned judgment and order dated 22-12-1989. The Petitioner-Board challenged the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Session Judge. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner-Board challenged the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Session Judge on various grounds.

The court order discusses the importance of preventing water pollution and the urgency of disposing of pending pollution cases. It references Section 33 of the Act, which gives the Pollution Control Board the power to make an application to a court to restrain a person from causing pollution in streams or wells. The court emphasizes the importance of this section and the duty it places on the court to prevent pollution that is hazardous to life. The court also references a chart of pending pollution cases and urges all courts to expedite their clearing.

The court order discusses the difference between Sections 25 and 26, which contain powers of the Pollution Control Board, and Section 33, which contains the right of the Board and powers of the court in matters of pollution. The court clarifies that Section 33 is independent and not dependent on any complaint or enquiry. The court also emphasizes that the word "desist" in Clause (i) of Sub-section (3) of Section 33 means to "leave off, abstain, seize and/or to stop" a particular activity of an industrial unit that is likely to cause pollution, and not the entire unit. The court criticizes the learned Judge for misinterpreting the impugned order passed by the learned Magistrate and for giving directions to the parties to the proceedings instead of confirming or setting aside the impugned orders. The court also commends the efficient response of all the subordinate courts in providing updated information on pending pollution cases.

The court order acknowledges the efficient response of all the learned judges and magistrates in responding to wireless messages requesting information on pending cases related to pollution and environment protection acts. The complied chart shows the number of pending cases in each subordinate court of the state.

The court order discusses the pending pollution cases in various courts and emphasizes the urgent need to dispose of them as quickly as possible. The court notes that pollution is a serious problem and that every court must keep this in mind while deciding pollution cases. The court also highlights the responsibility of the Pollution Control Boards and the Courts in enforcing the law and bridging the gap between legislation and effective enforcement. The court emphasizes the need for urgent action against defaulting industrial units to prevent further aggravation of the pollution problem.

The court order outlines responsibilities for agencies and individuals involved in preventing pollution in a river. Delinquent industrial units accused of discharging effluent water should cooperate to save the situation for all. Complainants should take steps to ensure court proceedings are conducted expeditiously, including opposing adjournments and being present for hearings. The court also outlines duties for the court itself, including not adjourning cases unnecessarily and ensuring all necessary witnesses are examined promptly. The order concludes by allowing a group of criminal revision applications and suspending the judgment for one month.
