The first court order pertains to a petition filed by a concerned citizen seeking to stop the quarry operations of the 7th respondent due to the threat caused to life and property and the degradation of the ecology and environment. The 7th respondent has a valid lease obtained from the 4th respondent, but the petitioner relies on reports that speak of the fragile nature of the land and the need to stop all mining and quarrying activities in the area. The petitioner demands immediate closure of the quarrying operations carried on by the 7th respondent, despite the same being under valid permit, for reason of the permit having been issued in violation of environmental laws. The court has heard the case and will deliver a judgment.

The second court order discusses a dispute over quarrying operations in the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity spot. The petitioner argues that the quarrying operations are in violation of environmental laws and could harm the local flora and fauna. The 7th respondent argues that they have a right to continue quarrying operations as permitted by the government. The court notes that existing projects are not prohibited by the notification designating the area as an eco-sensitive zone, but the petitioner's concerns about the impact on the environment should be considered. The court also orders a survey to verify whether there is any encroachment into government land by the 7th respondent.

The third court order discusses a case where police protection was declined for extraction of earth from a privately owned property, as the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to a decent environment. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is also mentioned, with the State Biodiversity Board having the power to restrict certain activities that could have a debilitating effect on the ecology and conservation of biodiversity. The court directs a survey to be conducted of the properties, with the Kerala State Bio Diversity Board conducting an assessment of the area and making suitable recommendations to the State. The 7th respondent is not allowed to carry on any quarrying operations during the survey period.

All three court orders revolve around the issue of quarrying operations and their impact on the environment.
