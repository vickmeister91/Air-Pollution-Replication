The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Raja under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with a case registered against him for possession of two horns of a deer (Sambhur) under sections 9, 27, 29, 44 & 51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The counsel for the applicant argued that he has been falsely implicated and that no article was seized from his possession. The State opposed the bail application citing the applicant's previous case of hunting wild animals. However, the court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant has not been convicted in any forest offence, is in custody since 2.1.2017, and the investigation is over. The applicant was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000/- and appear before the Investigating Officer/concerned Range Officer, Forest Range, Badi, District Raisen on 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month between 11 A.M., to 2 P.M. for the next six months during the trial.

The case against Raja was registered under sections 9, 27, 29, 44 & 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, which deal with the possession of wild animals and their parts. The counsel for the applicant argued that he has been falsely implicated and that no article was seized from his possession. The State, on the other hand, opposed the bail application citing the applicant's previous case of hunting wild animals. The court, however, allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant has not been convicted in any forest offence, is in custody since 2.1.2017, and the investigation is over.

The court's decision to grant bail to Raja was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the applicant has not been convicted in any forest offence. This suggests that Raja has no prior history of violating wildlife protection laws. Secondly, the court observed that the applicant has been in custody since 2.1.2017. This indicates that Raja has already spent a considerable amount of time in jail and that his continued detention may not be necessary. Finally, the court noted that the investigation in the case is over. This suggests that there is no risk of the applicant tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions on the applicant's bail. Raja was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000/-. This is a common practice in bail cases where the accused is required to provide a financial guarantee to ensure that he will appear in court when required. Additionally, Raja was directed to appear before the Investigating Officer/concerned Range Officer, Forest Range, Badi, District Raisen on 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month between 11 A.M., to 2 P.M. for the next six months during the trial. This condition is aimed at ensuring that the applicant cooperates with the investigation and does not abscond.

The court's decision to grant bail to Raja has been criticized by some wildlife activists who argue that it sends a wrong message to poachers and wildlife traffickers. They argue that the court should have taken a stricter view of the case and denied bail to the applicant. However, others have defended the court's decision, arguing that bail is a legal right and that the court has followed due process in granting bail to the applicant.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Raja under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with a case registered against him for possession of two horns of a deer (Sambhur) under sections 9, 27, 29, 44 & 51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant has not been convicted in any forest offence, is in custody since 2.1.2017, and the investigation is over. The applicant was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000/- and appear before the Investigating Officer/concerned Range Officer, Forest Range, Badi, District Raisen on 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month between 11 A.M., to 2 P.M. for the next six months during the trial. While the court's decision has been criticized by some wildlife activists, others have defended it as a legal right.
