The court recently granted bail to Rangilal Kol, who was accused of possessing leopard skin, under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. The court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant is innocent, a first offender, and there is no likelihood of him absconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but will be cancelled if the applicant breaches any of the pre-conditions of bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rangilal Kol was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found that the applicant was innocent and a first-time offender. This means that he has no prior criminal record and is unlikely to commit any further offences in the future. Secondly, the court found that there was no likelihood of the applicant absconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence. This means that the applicant is not a flight risk and is unlikely to interfere with the investigation or trial in any way.

In order to ensure that the applicant complies with the conditions of bail, the court ordered him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000. This bond acts as a guarantee that the applicant will appear in court when required and will comply with the conditions of bail. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicant, including cooperating in the trial and not contacting any other accused persons in the case. These conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant does not interfere with the investigation or trial in any way.

The court's order granting bail to Rangilal Kol will remain effective until the end of the trial. However, if the applicant breaches any of the pre-conditions of bail, the order will be cancelled. This means that the applicant will be taken back into custody and will have to remain in jail until the trial is completed.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Rangilal Kol was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case. The court found that the applicant was not a flight risk and was unlikely to interfere with the investigation or trial in any way. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that he complies with the conditions of bail. If the applicant complies with these conditions, he will be able to remain out of custody until the end of the trial.
