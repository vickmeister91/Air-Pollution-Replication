The Bombay High Court recently heard a public interest litigation case regarding unauthorized constructions in the jurisdiction of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). The court criticized the lack of governance and enforcement of urban planning legislation by the PCMC and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) for not enforcing compliance with the law. The Pawna River was highlighted as a vital source of water in the area, and several unauthorized constructions were carried out in the green belt of the river. The New Millenium English Medium School was constructed without building permission, and the PCMC had issued nearly 66,324 notices and commenced demolition of illegal structures. 

The PCMC submitted a proposal to the State Government to regularize all illegal constructions prior to 31 March 2011. However, the Fourth Respondent raised an objection to the locus of the Petitioner, but the court did not entertain this objection. The court ordered the Commissioner of PCMC to take immediate steps against all unauthorized structures and remove all offending structures in the green zone with the help of the Commissioner of Police. The PCMC and MPCB were instructed to use their powers under relevant laws for lodging prosecutions and dealing with violations. 

The court also directed the Fourth Respondent (the school) to remove the unauthorized construction by May 31, 2014, and restore the site to its original condition. The PCMC and Commissioner of Police were ordered to provide necessary assistance for the removal of the unauthorized structure if it was not removed by the deadline. The court ordered the PCMC to take action against unauthorized structures and submit a report within three months. The case will be reviewed for compliance on January 17, 2014.

The court's order highlights the importance of following urban planning legislation and the need for strict enforcement of the law. The unauthorized constructions in the green belt of the Pawna River pose a threat to the environment and the vital source of water in the area. The court's order to remove all offending structures in the green zone with the help of the Commissioner of Police and file a compliance report within three months is a step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that the law is followed.

The court's order also emphasizes the need for accountability and responsibility. The PCMC and MPCB were criticized for not enforcing compliance with the law and were instructed to use their powers under relevant laws for lodging prosecutions and dealing with violations. The court's order to take action against unauthorized structures and submit a report within three months is a step towards ensuring that those responsible for unauthorized constructions are held accountable.

The court's order regarding the New Millenium English Medium School highlights the need for building permission and following the law. The school was constructed without building permission, and the court directed the Fourth Respondent to remove the unauthorized construction by May 31, 2014, and restore the site to its original condition. The PCMC and Commissioner of Police were ordered to provide necessary assistance for the removal of the unauthorized structure if it was not removed by the deadline. This order emphasizes the importance of following the law and obtaining building permission before constructing any structure.

In conclusion, the court's order regarding unauthorized constructions in the jurisdiction of PCMC highlights the importance of following urban planning legislation and the need for strict enforcement of the law.
