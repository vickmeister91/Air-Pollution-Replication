The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where petitioners sought compensation for damage caused to their orange trees by wild animals. In the first case, Smt. Vimal Haribhau Naik filed a petition seeking compensation for the loss of her orange trees caused by crop raiding wild animals. She had planted 125 samplings of orange trees in her agricultural field in 2010, which were destroyed by a herd of blue-bulls in 2012. The petitioner claimed compensation in terms of a Government Resolution dated 02/7/2010, and a panchanama was drawn noting damage to 100 orange trees out of 125 trees and recommending payment of compensation of Rs.8,000/- @ Rs.80 per tree. The court heard the case and made the rule returnable forthwith.

In the second case, the court heard arguments from both sides, with the petitioner arguing that the government resolution allowing compensation for damage caused by some wild animals but not others was arbitrary and unreasonable. The government argued that the resolution was based on the behavior of wild animals and that a new resolution had been issued to include other animals. The court ultimately did not grant compensation to the petitioner, as the new resolution had prospective application only.

The third court order discusses a case where a petitioner is seeking compensation for the loss of orange trees caused by a protected animal, the blue-bull. The court examines a government resolution that provides compensation for loss caused by certain wild animals, but not for loss of fruit-bearing trees caused by blue-bulls. The court finds that this classification is irrational and violates the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court declares the government resolution to be bad in law to the extent that it makes an unreasonable classification.

In the fourth court order, the court discusses a case where a government resolution excluded tigers from a compensation scheme for crop damage caused by wild animals. The court found this exclusion to be unreasonable and ordered compensation for damage caused by a tiger. The government later amended the resolution to include other wild animals, but this could not be applied retroactively to the case in question. The court discusses the principle of supplying a casus omissus (a missing case) in a government resolution, which can be allowed in certain circumstances. In this case, the court found a clear necessity to include compensation for damage caused by the blue bull, a protected wild animal. The court also notes the importance of protecting wild animals and the environment. Ultimately, the court orders compensation for damage caused by the blue bull to the petitioner's orange trees.

In the final court order, the court states that the petitioner is entitled to compensation for damages caused to their orange trees by a wild animal, the blue bull. The compensation will be in accordance with a government resolution dated 02/7/2010, with a rate of Rs. 200 per tree. The subsequent resolution dated 05/9/2013 with a higher rate of Rs. 250 per tree does not apply to this case. The court allows the petition and rules in favor of the petitioner. No costs are awarded.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complexities of determining compensation for damage caused by wild animals to agricultural crops. The government resolutions in question were found to be arbitrary and in violation of the principle of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India. The court recognized the importance of protecting wild animals and the environment, but also acknowledged the need to compensate farmers for their losses. Ultimately, the court ordered compensation for damage caused by the blue bull to the petitioners' orange trees, in accordance with the relevant government resolution.
