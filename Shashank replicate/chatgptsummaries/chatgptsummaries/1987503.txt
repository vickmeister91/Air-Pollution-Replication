The Hissar Central Co-Operative Bank was embroiled in a case involving its former Secretary, Kali Ram, who was accused of embezzlement of the bank's money. Ram was removed from service, but the Labour Court found that the enquiry was not done properly and ordered his reinstatement with full back wages. The bank challenged the award before the High Court, but only the question of payment of back wages was admitted. The Supreme Court considered the nature of the charges, the extent of Ram's involvement, and whether his conduct caused loss to the bank. 

The Supreme Court found that Ram did not possess a clean record and his exoneration was based on reasonable doubt. Therefore, the court ordered that Ram be paid only 25% of the amount due to him by way of back wages from December 3, 1991, until the date of his reinstatement. The court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the facts of the case and the evidence presented.
