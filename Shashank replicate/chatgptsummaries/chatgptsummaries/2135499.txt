The Delhi High Court recently heard a case involving Vedanta Alumina Ltd. and Prafulla Samantra & Ors. The case revolved around the question of whether the first respondent had the right to appeal before the National Environment Appellate Authority under the National Environment Authority Act. The first respondent claimed to be a social and environmental activist and objected to the public hearing for a proposed aluminum smelter plant due to faulty EIA and lack of environmental clearance. The second respondent directed the appellant to stop construction activities until environmental clearance was obtained. The environmental clearance was eventually granted, and the first respondent filed an appeal, which was dismissed by the Authority.

The court order discusses an appeal filed by the first respondent against the environmental clearance granted to a project by the MoEF. The Authority dismissed the appeal stating that the first respondent was not a "person aggrieved" under Section 11 of the Act. The first respondent filed a writ petition, which was allowed by the court, stating that he had the locus standi to maintain an appeal before the Authority. The court quashed the order of the Authority and directed it to entertain and dispose of the appeal of the first respondent in accordance with the law. The appellant argued that a person aggrieved has to be a person with a legal grievance, and the first respondent did not fall under the definition of a person aggrieved under the Act. The first respondent argued that the question of locus of an individual in our country, as far as the environment is concerned, rests in the public and constitutional law domain.

The court order states that the environment is a public and constitutional right that cannot be limited by statutory laws. Any action that affects the environment can be challenged by individuals as a matter of right and duty. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the duty of citizens to protect and improve the environment. The court notes that the enforcement of environmental laws has been tardy and encourages the involvement of NGOs and other environmentalists in the implementation of these laws. The court also emphasizes the strong link between Article 21 and the right to know about environmental issues.

The court order states that the government must ensure transparency in the approval process for projects that may affect the environment by calling upon the applicant to publish their proposal for public awareness. The right to know is important, especially when secret government decisions may affect health, life, and livelihood. Voluntary organizations play a crucial role in protecting the environment and creating awareness of the necessity to preserve it. The court also emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and compliance with the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986. Section 11 of the Act allows any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of environmental clearance to appeal to the National Environment Appellate Authority within 30 days.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "aggrieved person" in relation to appeals against environmental clearances. It states that any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of environmental clearance has an undoubted locus standi to file an appeal. This includes associations of persons who work in the field of environment. The court also emphasizes the importance of access to justice and the need to liberalize the rule of standing in order to provide judicial redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from other violation of the Constitution or the law.

The court order emphasizes the importance of procedural justice and social justice in finding procedures that protect the rights of ordinary people. It cites previous cases and the need for a broad interpretation of remedial statutes to ensure relief is not denied to those intended to be helped. The court also acknowledges the first respondent's right to appeal and dismisses the appeal with costs.

In summary, the Delhi High Court's recent ruling in the case involving Vedanta Alumina Ltd. and Prafulla Samantra & Ors. highlights the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development. The court emphasizes the right of individuals and organizations to challenge actions that affect the environment and the need for transparency in the approval process for projects that may have an impact on the environment. The court also stresses the importance of access to justice and the need to liberalize the rule of standing to provide judicial redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from other violation of the Constitution or the law. Overall, the court's ruling serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment and the rights of individuals and organizations to do so.
