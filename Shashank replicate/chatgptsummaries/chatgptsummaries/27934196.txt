The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) issued a notification withdrawing its earlier notifications and announcing that it would only accept analysis reports from laboratories recognized by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and Climate Change, Government of India New Delhi. This notification was challenged by three petitioner firms who were recognized by the RSPCB. They sought relief to restrain the Board from interfering with their work. The matter was brought before the court, which held that the petitioner firms had no indefeasible or vested right by their recognition by the Board and that the power conferred on the Board under Section 17(2) of both the Water Act and Air Act was one of legislative discretion.

The RSPCB argued that the matter was amenable to the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and that the petitioner firms had an alternative remedy under Section 14 of the Act. The court agreed with the RSPCB and dismissed the writ petitions. The court held that the petitioner firms had an alternative remedy under the NGT Act, 2010, and should avail it.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the RSPCB had the power to regulate the laboratories that it recognized. The court held that the RSPCB's decision to only accept analysis reports from laboratories recognized by the MoEF was a valid exercise of its power. The court also held that the petitioner firms had an alternative remedy under the NGT Act, 2010, and that they should avail it.

The court's decision has important implications for the regulation of pollution in Rajasthan. The RSPCB's decision to only accept analysis reports from laboratories recognized by the MoEF will help to ensure that the reports are of a high quality. This will help to ensure that the RSPCB is able to effectively regulate pollution in the state.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of alternative remedies in environmental cases. The NGT Act, 2010, provides an important alternative remedy for parties who are aggrieved by decisions of environmental regulators. This alternative remedy helps to ensure that environmental disputes are resolved in a timely and effective manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the RSPCB's power to regulate the laboratories that it recognizes. The court's decision also highlights the importance of alternative remedies in environmental cases.
