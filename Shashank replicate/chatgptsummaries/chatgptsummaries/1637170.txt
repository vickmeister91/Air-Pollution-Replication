In the first court order, the case revolves around a dispute over land ownership. The Sub-Divisional Officer had granted land to an individual, who then sold it to the appellants. However, the District Magistrate later found that the Sub-Divisional Officer had no authority to grant the land and cancelled the transfer. The appellants challenged this decision in a writ petition, but the High Court dismissed it, stating that the Sub-Divisional Officer had no jurisdiction to grant the land. The appellants argued that the District Magistrate had no authority to cancel the transfer, but the court rejected this argument, stating that the Sub-Divisional Officer's order was invalid and improper. The court also noted that the appellants had failed to establish that they had lawfully secured the land.

This court order highlights the importance of proper authority and jurisdiction when it comes to land ownership. The Sub-Divisional Officer's decision to grant the land was deemed invalid, and the appellants were unable to prove that they had lawfully secured the land. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to ensure that they are following proper procedures and obtaining land through legal means.

In the second court order, the case involves a Health Centre that was supposed to be given to a village. However, the High Court refused to quash the order as it would have been contrary to valid resolutions passed by the Panchayat Samithi. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's decision, stating that it is not always necessary to strike down an order passed against the petitioner in breach of natural justice. In this case, any interference with the impugned order would result in restoration of orders passed earlier in favor of the appellants, which are otherwise not in accordance with the law. Therefore, the appeals were dismissed with no order as to costs.

This court order highlights the importance of following proper procedures and adhering to valid resolutions. The High Court's decision to refuse the order was based on the fact that it would have gone against valid resolutions passed by the Panchayat Samithi. The Supreme Court agreed with this decision, stating that interfering with the order would result in restoration of orders passed earlier in favor of the appellants, which are not in accordance with the law. It emphasizes the need for individuals to follow proper procedures and adhere to valid resolutions to avoid legal disputes.

Overall, both court orders emphasize the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining land or orders through legal means. They also highlight the significance of jurisdiction and valid resolutions in legal disputes.
