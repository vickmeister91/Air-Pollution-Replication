In a recent case, the petitioner filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a summons/written order issued by the Inspector of Police, Karungalpalayam Police Station, Erode District, under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, during the proceedings, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition and made an endorsement to that effect. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition as withdrawn.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had sought to quash a summons/written order issued by the Inspector of Police, Karungalpalayam Police Station, Erode District, under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a court to issue a summons or written order to any person within its jurisdiction to produce any document or thing in his possession or under his control, if the court considers that the production of such document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

However, during the proceedings, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition and made an endorsement to that effect. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition as withdrawn. This means that the petitioner's request to quash the summons/written order was not considered by the court, as the petitioner had withdrawn the petition.

It is important to note that the court's decision to dismiss the petition as withdrawn does not mean that the petitioner's request to quash the summons/written order was without merit. It simply means that the petitioner chose to withdraw the petition before the court could make a decision on the matter.

In conclusion, the petitioner in this case filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a summons/written order issued by the Inspector of Police, Karungalpalayam Police Station, Erode District, under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition and made an endorsement to that effect. The court dismissed the petition as withdrawn. While the court did not make a decision on the petitioner's request to quash the summons/written order, it is important to note that the court's decision to dismiss the petition as withdrawn does not mean that the petitioner's request was without merit.
