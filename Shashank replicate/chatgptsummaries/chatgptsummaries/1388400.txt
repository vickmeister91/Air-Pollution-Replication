The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case brought by PNC Infratech Limited, a contractor, challenging the levy of cess under the Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Cess Act, 1996. The petitioner argued that they were not covered within the definition clause and that the cess could not be imposed on construction work that did not have the approval of the local authority. However, the court found that the levy of tax had to take place in advance where construction takes place with the approval of the local authority or where the construction is taking place in respect to a building of a Government or of a public sector undertaking.

The court also noted that the Building and Other Construction Workers' (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 and the Rules of 2009 operate in a different field and cannot come to the aid and support of each other. The court order cites previous cases to establish that in a taxing act, one must look only at what is clearly said and there is no room for intendment or equity. The court also states that the Cess Act is a fiscal enactment and liability for cess is to be assessed under the Cess Act only.

The Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Cess Act, 1996, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on the cost of construction incurred by employers with a view to augmenting the resources of the Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Board constituted under the Building and Other Construction Workers' (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996. The Act applies to every establishment which employs ten or more building workers in any building or other construction work.

The Act defines a building worker as any person who is employed to do any skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual, supervisory, technical or clerical work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment are expressed or implied, in connection with any building or other construction work. The Act also defines construction work as the construction, alteration, repairs, maintenance or demolition of or, in relation to, any building, street, road, railway, tramway, bridge, tunnel, canal, dam, dock, harbour, airport or airfield, irrigation, drainage, embankment and land improvement works or any other work which is associated with such construction.

The petitioner argued that they were not covered within the definition clause and that the cess could not be imposed on construction work that did not have the approval of the local authority. However, the court found that the levy of tax had to take place in advance where construction takes place with the approval of the local authority or where the construction is taking place in respect to a building of a Government or of a public sector undertaking.
