In a court order issued in the late 1990s, the issues to be addressed in a lawsuit between the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh regarding water disputes were outlined. The order addressed several key issues that needed to be resolved in order to move forward with the case.

One of the main issues addressed in the court order was whether the suit was barred by certain constitutional and legal provisions. This was an important consideration, as it could impact the ability of the court to hear the case and make a ruling.

Another issue that needed to be addressed was the binding decisions of the KWDT. The KWDT, or Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, had previously made rulings on water disputes between the two states. The court needed to determine how these rulings would impact the current case.

The implementation of Scheme B was also a key issue that needed to be addressed. Scheme B was a plan put forth by the KWDT to resolve water disputes between the two states. The court needed to determine whether this plan was being implemented properly and whether it was effective in resolving the disputes.

The legality of projects executed by Karnataka was another issue that needed to be addressed. The court needed to determine whether these projects were in compliance with the law and whether they were having a negative impact on water resources in Andhra Pradesh.

Finally, the jurisdiction of the court was also a key issue that needed to be resolved. The court needed to determine whether it had the authority to hear the case and make a ruling.

To move forward with the case, the court ordered that the discovery, inspection, and interrogatories process be completed within four weeks. This was an important step in gathering evidence and information that would be needed to make a ruling in the case.

The court also ordered that the case be listed for directions in January 1998. This meant that the parties involved in the case would need to come together to discuss the next steps in the legal process and to determine how the case would proceed.

Overall, the court order issued in the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh water disputes case addressed several key issues that needed to be resolved in order to move forward with the case. By outlining these issues and ordering specific steps to be taken, the court was able to provide clarity and direction to the parties involved in the case.
