The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Bhind in Criminal Case No. 1607/2015. The applicant had filed a complaint against the respondents for offences punishable under Section 23(1), 23(3) and 25 of the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act 1994. The applicant had also filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the seizure of two ultrasound machines which, according to the applicant, were being used by respondent No.1.

The Trial Court rejected the application on the ground that seizure of two ultrasound machines and the production of their bill of purchase were not essential for the disposal of the complaint filed by the applicant. The applicant contended that the Court in exercise of powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. could direct for the production of two ultrasound machines. However, the Court held that unless and until the Trial Court comes to a conclusion that production of any document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of trial, the powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised. The Court dismissed the petition.

The case at hand involves the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act 1994, which prohibits the use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques for the purpose of determining the sex of a fetus. The Act was enacted to prevent female foeticide and to promote gender equality. The Act makes it an offence to conduct or authorize any pre-natal diagnostic technique for the purpose of determining the sex of a fetus. The Act also prohibits the sale, distribution, or advertisement of any equipment or substance used for the purpose of conducting such tests.

In this case, the applicant had filed a complaint against the respondents for offences punishable under Section 23(1), 23(3) and 25 of the Act. Section 23(1) of the Act provides for punishment for conducting or causing to be conducted any pre-natal diagnostic technique for the purpose of determining the sex of a fetus. Section 23(3) provides for punishment for advertisement of any pre-natal diagnostic technique for the purpose of determining the sex of a fetus. Section 25 provides for punishment for contravention of any provision of the Act.

The applicant had also filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the seizure of two ultrasound machines which, according to the applicant, were being used by respondent No.1. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. provides for the power of the Court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The Trial Court rejected the application on the ground that seizure of two ultrasound machines and the production of their bill of purchase were not essential for the disposal of the complaint filed by the applicant. The applicant contended that the Court in exercise of powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. could direct for the production of two ultrasound machines. However, the Court held that unless and until the Trial Court comes to a conclusion that production of any document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of trial, the powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised.

The Court's decision is in line with the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C., which provides for the power of the Court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The Court held that the powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised unless and until the Trial Court comes to a conclusion that production of any document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of trial.
