The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, is a crucial piece of legislation that governs the relationship between landlords and tenants in the city. Recently, a court order was issued in a case involving an eviction petition filed by Mahender Pal against Ram Prakash & Sons. The respondent in the case filed an application under Section 25-B of the Act, seeking leave to contest the eviction petition.

The respondent made several allegations against the applicant, including that the eviction petition was bad for non-joinder of necessary party and that the sale-deed filed by the applicant was undervalued. Additionally, the respondent alleged that the applicant had re-let a shop to a company known as 'Imprint' and that the intention of the applicant was to re-let the premises in question on market rent after getting it vacated.

The court considered the respondent's application for leave to defend and ultimately allowed it. This means that the respondent will be able to contest the eviction petition and present evidence to support their claims.

The issue of non-joinder of necessary party is a common one in eviction cases. It refers to the failure of the applicant to include all parties who have an interest in the property in question. In this case, the respondent alleged that there was another party who had an interest in the property and that they should have been included in the eviction petition.

The allegation of undervaluation of the sale-deed is also significant. It suggests that the applicant may have deliberately undervalued the property in order to pay lower stamp duty and registration fees. This is a common practice in real estate transactions, but it is illegal and can result in serious consequences for those involved.

The allegation that the applicant had re-let the shop to another company is also noteworthy. If true, it would suggest that the applicant had no intention of using the property for their own purposes and was instead looking to profit from it by renting it out at market rates. This would be a violation of the terms of the lease agreement and could result in the eviction petition being dismissed.

Overall, the court order in this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when filing an eviction petition. It also underscores the need for transparency and honesty in real estate transactions. By allowing the respondent to contest the eviction petition, the court has ensured that all parties will have a fair chance to present their case and that justice will be served.
