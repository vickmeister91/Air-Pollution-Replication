The case in question involves a challenge to an order passed by a Trial Judge under Order VII Rule 10A(1) and Order VII Rule 10A(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The order returned the plaint to the plaintiff and directed them to present before the National Green Tribunal. The petitioners challenged this order, arguing that the Trial Judge did not have the authority to issue such an order of transfer.

The National Green Tribunal, in response to the petitioners' challenge, held that neither the Civil Judge nor any other Court except the Hon'ble Supreme Court has the authority to issue any order of transfer. However, the High Court ultimately quashed and set aside the impugned order and restored the suit to file.

In its ruling, the High Court directed the Trial Judge to decide all the issues framed under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including the issue of jurisdiction. Additionally, the National Green Tribunal was directed to return the papers and proceedings to the petitioners for lodging those papers and proceedings before the learned 2nd Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Alibag, Raigad within two weeks from collection of papers and proceedings from the National Green Tribunal, Western Zone, Branch Pune.

The crux of the issue in this case is the question of jurisdiction. The Trial Judge had initially directed the plaintiffs to present their case before the National Green Tribunal, which the petitioners challenged on the grounds that the Trial Judge did not have the authority to issue such an order of transfer. The National Green Tribunal agreed with the petitioners, but the High Court ultimately ruled in their favor and restored the case to file.

The High Court's ruling is significant because it clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries of various courts and tribunals. The Court's decision to quash the Trial Judge's order and restore the case to file reinforces the principle that only the Hon'ble Supreme Court has the authority to issue orders of transfer between courts.

Furthermore, the High Court's direction to the Trial Judge to decide all the issues framed under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including the issue of jurisdiction, is an important reminder of the importance of due process and fair adjudication. By directing the Trial Judge to consider all relevant issues, the High Court ensures that the case is decided on its merits and in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the case in question involves a challenge to an order of transfer issued by a Trial Judge. The National Green Tribunal initially held that the Trial Judge did not have the authority to issue such an order, but the High Court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners and restored the case to file. The High Court's ruling clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries of various courts and tribunals and reinforces the importance of due process and fair adjudication.
