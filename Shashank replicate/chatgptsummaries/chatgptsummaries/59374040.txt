Mithun Sk, who had been in custody since November 2018, has been granted regular bail by the court in connection with a complaint case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner's father had already been granted bail earlier. The court has directed the petitioner to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of the same amount each. The petitioner has also been instructed to cooperate in the investigation and appear physically before the trial court on every date until the framing of charges.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 with the objective of protecting wild animals and plants and their habitats. The act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves for the protection of wildlife. It also prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

In this case, Mithun Sk was arrested for allegedly violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The details of the alleged violation are not clear from the available information. However, it is evident that the court found it appropriate to grant bail to the petitioner.

Bail is a legal provision that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court on the scheduled dates and cooperate with the investigation. The amount of bail is determined by the court based on various factors such as the severity of the offense, the likelihood of the person fleeing, and the person's criminal history.

In this case, the court has granted regular bail to Mithun Sk, which means that he can be released from custody and can continue to be out on bail until the trial is completed. The court has also imposed certain conditions on the petitioner, such as furnishing a bail bond and two sureties, cooperating in the investigation, and appearing physically before the trial court on every date until the framing of charges.

The purpose of imposing these conditions is to ensure that the petitioner does not flee or tamper with the evidence. The court has also directed the petitioner to cooperate in the investigation, which means that he must provide all the information and assistance required by the investigating agency to complete the investigation.

The court has also directed the petitioner to appear physically before the trial court on every date until the framing of charges. This is an important condition as it ensures that the petitioner is present in court during the trial and can be cross-examined by the prosecution. It also ensures that the trial proceeds smoothly without any unnecessary delays.

In conclusion, the court has granted regular bail to Mithun Sk in connection with a complaint case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner has been directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of the same amount each. The petitioner must cooperate in the investigation and appear physically before the trial court on every date until the framing of charges. These conditions have been imposed to ensure that the petitioner does not flee or tamper with the evidence and that the trial proceeds smoothly.
