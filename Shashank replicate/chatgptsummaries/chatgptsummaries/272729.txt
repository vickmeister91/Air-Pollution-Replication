The case at hand involves a petition for interim custody of a vehicle that was seized for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner had filed a petition for interim custody of his vehicle, which was dismissed by the learned Magistrate on the grounds that interim custody cannot be granted under Section 39(d) of the Act. The petitioner then filed another petition for the same relief, which was dismissed on the ground that the previous order must be reviewed. The petitioner challenged this order before the Sessions Court, which dismissed the revision. The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the orders.

The court found that the second and third orders were not illegal, but the first order was illegal as the learned Magistrate did not consider the petitioner's claim. The court allowed the petition and quashed the first order, remanding the case for fresh disposal in accordance with the law.

The petitioner had argued that the learned Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition for interim custody of his vehicle. The petitioner had contended that the vehicle was not involved in the offense and that he was the rightful owner of the vehicle. The petitioner had also argued that the vehicle was required for his livelihood and that its continued detention was causing him financial hardship.

The court noted that Section 39(d) of the Wild Life Protection Act provides for the seizure of any vehicle used for the commission of an offense under the Act. However, the court also noted that the Act does not provide for the grant of interim custody of the seized vehicle. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had correctly dismissed the petition on this ground.

The court then considered the petitioner's argument that the vehicle was not involved in the offense and that he was the rightful owner of the vehicle. The court noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to support this claim. The court observed that the seizure of the vehicle was made on the basis of a report submitted by the Forest Department, which had stated that the vehicle was used for the commission of the offense. The court held that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the report of the Forest Department must be accepted as true.

The court then considered the petitioner's argument that the vehicle was required for his livelihood and that its continued detention was causing him financial hardship. The court noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to support this claim either. The court observed that the petitioner had not stated what his livelihood was or how the vehicle was required for it. The court held that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the petitioner's claim must be rejected.

The court then considered the petitioner's challenge to the orders of the Sessions Court and the learned Magistrate. The court noted that the second and third orders were not illegal as they were passed in accordance with the law. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had correctly dismissed the second petition on the ground that the previous order must be reviewed. The court also observed that the Sessions Court had correctly dismissed the revision as there was no error in the order of the learned Magistrate.

The court then considered the petitioner's petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the orders. The court noted that Section 482 provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

The court held that the first order of the learned Magistrate was illegal as the learned Magistrate had not considered the petitioner's claim. The court observed that the petitioner had a right to be heard and that the learned Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition without considering the petitioner's claim. The court held that the first order must be quashed and the case remanded for fresh disposal in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court allowed the petition and quashed the first order of the learned Magistrate, remanding the case for fresh disposal in accordance with the law. The court held that the second and third orders were not illegal and that the petitioner's claims had not been substantiated. The court observed that the petitioner had a right to be heard and that the learned Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition without considering the petitioner's claim. The court held that the first order must be quashed and the case remanded for fresh disposal in accordance with the law.
