The court order in question pertains to a criminal complaint filed against Sh. Jagdish under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I Act). The petitioner had filed an application under section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) seeking the recalling of the complainant on the grounds that the previous counsel could not conduct proper cross-examination. However, the application was dismissed by the Learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Ld. ACMM), and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order.

The court, in its order, dismissed the revision petition, stating that it was not maintainable against interlocutory orders. The court cited a case law to support its decision and ordered the revision file to be consigned to the record room.

To understand the court's decision, it is important to first understand the relevant sections of the law. Section 138 of the N.I Act deals with dishonour of cheques and provides for criminal liability in case of default. Section 311 of the Cr.P.C deals with the power of the court to summon witnesses and examine them. It allows the court to recall a witness for further examination if it is necessary for the just decision of the case.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought the recalling of the complainant on the grounds that the previous counsel could not conduct proper cross-examination. The Ld. ACMM, however, dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner had not made out a case for recalling the complainant. The petitioner then filed a revision petition against the order.

The court, in its order, noted that the revision petition was against an interlocutory order and was therefore not maintainable. An interlocutory order is an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and does not finally determine the rights of the parties. The court cited the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, where it was held that a revision petition against an interlocutory order is not maintainable.

The court further noted that the power to recall a witness under section 311 of the Cr.P.C is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously. The court observed that the Ld. ACMM had considered the petitioner's application and had dismissed it after due consideration. The court, therefore, found no reason to interfere with the order of the Ld. ACMM.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal complaint filed under section 138 of the N.I Act. The petitioner had filed an application under section 311 of the Cr.P.C seeking the recalling of the complainant on the grounds that the previous counsel could not conduct proper cross-examination. The application was dismissed by the Ld. ACMM, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order. The court, however, dismissed the revision petition, stating that it was not maintainable against interlocutory orders. The court cited a case law to support its decision and ordered the revision file to be consigned to the record room.
