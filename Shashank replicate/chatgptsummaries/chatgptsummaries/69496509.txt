In a recent court order, Sujan @ Moru @ Monu @ Golu Halder was acquitted of charges under Section 356/379 IPC for assaulting and stealing the mobile phone of complainant Swati Dey. The prosecution had alleged that Sujan had stolen Swati's phone, but no phone was seized, and there were material contradictions in the testimony of witnesses. The identification of the phone was only through its IMEI number, which was not recorded. The court found no evidence linking the phone produced by the complainant with the offense.

The court order states that the prosecution was unable to prove the case against the accused, Sujan Haldar, beyond a reasonable doubt. The complainant's testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charges of offenses punishable under Section 356/379 IPC.

The court's decision was based on the lack of evidence linking Sujan to the alleged crime. The prosecution had failed to produce any concrete evidence that could link Sujan to the theft of Swati's phone. The identification of the phone was only through its IMEI number, which was not recorded. The prosecution had also failed to produce any witnesses who could testify to Sujan's involvement in the crime.

The court also noted that there were material contradictions in the testimony of witnesses. The prosecution had relied heavily on the testimony of Swati Dey, the complainant, but her testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented. The court found that her testimony was unreliable and could not be relied upon to prove the case against Sujan.

The court's decision to acquit Sujan was based on the principle of "innocent until proven guilty." The prosecution had failed to prove the case against Sujan beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, he was entitled to an acquittal.

In conclusion, the court's decision to acquit Sujan of charges under Section 356/379 IPC for assaulting and stealing the mobile phone of complainant Swati Dey was based on the lack of evidence linking Sujan to the alleged crime. The prosecution had failed to produce any concrete evidence that could link Sujan to the theft of Swati's phone, and the identification of the phone was only through its IMEI number, which was not recorded. The court also noted that there were material contradictions in the testimony of witnesses, and the complainant's testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented. The court's decision was based on the principle of "innocent until proven guilty," and Sujan was entitled to an acquittal as the prosecution had failed to prove the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
