The Delhi High Court has issued an order that the Delhi Bottling Co. Pvt. Ltd. must not discharge trade effluents into the Yamuna river until they set up a required treatment plant and conform to the quality of trade effluents according to the standards prescribed by the Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution. The court found that the sample of trade effluents taken by the Board was not divided into two parts and analyzed in accordance with the provisions of Section 21(5) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and therefore, the conclusion that the petitioners were discharging effluents in the stream which were likely to cause pollution is not sustainable.

The court also noted that the restraint order did not include a direction to erect a treatment plant, and the Board has the power to launch prosecution against the company for non-erection of a treatment plant under Section 41 of the Act. The court accepted the petition and set aside the impugned order of the learned Magistrate.

The Delhi Bottling Co. Pvt. Ltd. had been accused of discharging trade effluents into the Yamuna river, which is a major source of water for the city of Delhi. The company had been issued a restraint order by the Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, which had directed the company to stop discharging effluents into the river. However, the company had challenged the order in court, arguing that the sample of trade effluents taken by the Board was not divided into two parts and analyzed in accordance with the provisions of Section 21(5) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court found that the Board had not followed the proper procedure for analyzing the sample of trade effluents, and therefore, the conclusion that the petitioners were discharging effluents in the stream which were likely to cause pollution was not sustainable. The court also noted that the restraint order did not include a direction to erect a treatment plant, and the Board has the power to launch prosecution against the company for non-erection of a treatment plant under Section 41 of the Act.

The court ordered that the Delhi Bottling Co. Pvt. Ltd. must not discharge trade effluents into the Yamuna river until they set up a required treatment plant and conform to the quality of trade effluents according to the standards prescribed by the Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution. The court also set aside the impugned order of the learned Magistrate.

The Delhi High Court's order is significant because it highlights the importance of following proper procedures for analyzing samples of trade effluents. The court's decision to set aside the impugned order of the learned Magistrate also underscores the need for restraint orders to include clear directions for companies to comply with environmental regulations.

The court's order also sends a strong message to companies that they must take responsibility for their environmental impact and take steps to mitigate any harm caused by their operations. The Delhi Bottling Co. Pvt. Ltd. will now be required to set up a treatment plant and conform to the quality of trade effluents according to the standards prescribed by the Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution.

Overall, the Delhi High Court's order is a positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that companies are held accountable for their actions. It is important for companies to recognize the impact of their operations on the environment and take steps to minimize any harm caused. The court's decision serves as a reminder that environmental regulations must be followed and that companies must take their environmental responsibilities seriously.
