The Patna High Court recently received a public interest petition from residents of Village-Matia in Block-Laxmipur, District-Jamui, alleging that a brick kiln chimney constructed by respondent no.8 in the residential area is hazardous and detrimental to the health of the general public of the village. The petitioners argued that the brick kiln chimney was causing air pollution and respiratory problems for the residents of the village. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board responded to the petition by providing guidelines for the establishment of brick kilns and found that the proposal for the establishment of the brick kiln by respondent no.8 met the guidelines.

The court examined the guidelines provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and found that they did not prohibit the establishment of brick kilns in residential areas. The court also examined a letter from the Block Development Officer, Laxmipur, which stated that the establishment of the brick kiln by respondent no.8 was in compliance with the guidelines provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The court found no contradiction between the guidelines and the letter from the Block Development Officer, Laxmipur, and disposed of the writ petition accordingly.

The court's decision has been met with mixed reactions. While some residents of Village-Matia are disappointed with the decision, others believe that the court's decision was fair and just. Those who are disappointed with the decision argue that the brick kiln chimney is causing air pollution and respiratory problems for the residents of the village and that the court should have taken these factors into consideration when making its decision. They also argue that the court should have considered the health and well-being of the residents of the village as a priority.

On the other hand, those who believe that the court's decision was fair and just argue that the guidelines provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board are in place to ensure that brick kilns are established in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. They argue that the court's decision was based on these guidelines and that the establishment of the brick kiln by respondent no.8 was in compliance with these guidelines. They also argue that the court's decision was based on the evidence presented to it and that the health and well-being of the residents of the village were taken into consideration.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of following guidelines and regulations when establishing brick kilns. It also highlights the need for residents to voice their concerns and bring attention to potential hazards in their communities. While the decision may not have been satisfactory for all parties involved, it is important to remember that the court's decision was based on the evidence presented to it and the guidelines provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.
