The first court order pertains to a revision filed by the accused in a Section 138 NI Act complaint. The accused had been imposed a cost of Rs. 3000/- when they did not appear in court despite seeking pass over. The accused filed a revision against this order. The court observed that the impugned order was an interlocutory order and defined the term. The court also laid down tests to determine the finality of a judgment or order. Ultimately, the court allowed the revision and set aside the order imposing the cost on the accused.

The court order discusses the definition of an interlocutory order and its limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. It states that an interlocutory order is one that does not finally dispose of the rights of parties and only decides a particular aspect or issue in a proceeding. Orders that substantially affect the rights of the accused or adjudicate certain rights of the parties cannot be considered interlocutory and can be challenged in a revision. The order also cites various cases to support its arguments.

The third court order states that orders of interlocutory nature, such as those for production of documents or recalling witnesses, cannot be challenged in a revision under Section 397(2) of the Cr.P.C. The order of imposing cost on account of delay in trial is also considered an interlocutory order and does not decide any right of the accused. The revision is dismissed and the file is consigned to RR, with a copy of the order sent to the trial court for information.

In summary, the court orders revolve around the concept of interlocutory orders and their limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. An interlocutory order is one that does not finally dispose of the rights of parties and only decides a particular aspect or issue in a proceeding. Orders that substantially affect the rights of the accused or adjudicate certain rights of the parties cannot be considered interlocutory and can be challenged in a revision.
