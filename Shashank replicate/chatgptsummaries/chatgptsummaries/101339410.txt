The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently disposed of four petitions related to violations of environmental clearance regulations. The first two petitions were filed by AB Multiplex Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Jassum Propcon Projects Ltd. seeking the quashing of complaints filed against them under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaints alleged that the companies had violated environmental clearance regulations. The petitioners argued that they did not require environmental clearance, and the court found that they did not violate any regulations. The court also noted that the complaints were filed by the Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board.

The third petition pertained to a company and its directors who were responsible for the construction of a commercial complex without obtaining prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest. The accused were given notices and public advertisements about the violation, but they did not take any action to stop it. The accused persons were charged with a criminal conspiracy and were carrying out illegal construction without any prior approval. The court ordered a complaint to be filed against the accused company and its directors.

The fourth petition was filed by two petitioners who were being prosecuted for not obtaining environmental clearance from the Central government before starting their projects. However, the petitioners had approached the Ministry of Environment & Forests for clarification and were informed that their project did not require any clearance. The court found the complaint against the petitioners to be vague and quashed all proceedings against them.

The court order in the first two petitions stated that the companies did not violate any regulations and did not require environmental clearance. The court noted that the complaints were filed by the Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board and disposed of the petitions.

The court also cautioned that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection.
