The court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S. Baljinder Brick Field, which sought to quash an order cancelling their No Objection Certificate (NOC) granted by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). The court stated that since the petitioner had a remedy of appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, it was not a fit case for interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner was advised to take recourse to the remedy of appeal.

The case involved the cancellation of an NOC granted to M/S. Baljinder Brick Field by the UPPCB. The cancellation was based on the findings of an inspection conducted by the UPPCB, which revealed that the petitioner was not complying with the conditions of the NOC. The petitioner challenged the cancellation of the NOC by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court, however, held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy of appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy before approaching the court under Article 226. The court further observed that the remedy of appeal was an effective and efficacious remedy, which would enable the petitioner to challenge the cancellation of the NOC on merits.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under Article 226. The court held that the petitioner had not shown any violation of the principles of natural justice or any other legal infirmity in the cancellation of the NOC. The court further observed that the UPPCB had acted within its jurisdiction and in accordance with the law in cancelling the NOC.

The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition and advised the petitioner to take recourse to the remedy of appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court also observed that the petitioner was at liberty to raise all the grounds and contentions before the appellate authority, including the grounds raised in the writ petition.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court has reiterated that the remedy of appeal is an effective and efficacious remedy, which should be availed of before approaching the court under Article 226. The court has also emphasized that the principles of natural justice must be followed in all administrative actions, including the cancellation of NOCs by pollution control boards.
