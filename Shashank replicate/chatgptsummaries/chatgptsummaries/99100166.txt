The case in question involves Maheshwari Minerals, a company that is challenging an order passed by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board to close down their crushing unit. The petitioner argues that the respondents have no power to pass such a direction and that the principles of natural justice have been violated.

The court has granted an interim relief to the petitioner and has stayed the operation of the order passed by the Pollution Control Board. This means that the respondents are directed to allow the petitioner-unit to continue with its crushing activities until the case is heard on 25th August, 2011.

The court's decision to grant an interim relief to the petitioner is significant because it allows the company to continue its operations without interruption. This is important for Maheshwari Minerals, as any interruption in their crushing activities could have a significant impact on their business.

The court's decision to stay the operation of the order passed by the Pollution Control Board is also significant because it suggests that the court has found merit in the petitioner's argument that the respondents have no power to pass such a direction. This is an important point, as it suggests that the court may ultimately rule in favor of the petitioner.

The petitioner's argument that the principles of natural justice have been violated is also significant. Natural justice is a fundamental principle of law that requires that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made. If the court finds that the principles of natural justice have been violated, it could have significant implications for the case.

Overall, the court's decision to grant an interim relief to the petitioner and stay the operation of the order passed by the Pollution Control Board is a significant development in this case. It suggests that the court has found merit in the petitioner's argument and that the case is likely to be heard in full on 25th August, 2011.
