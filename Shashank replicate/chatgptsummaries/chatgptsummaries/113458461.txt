The Indian judiciary has been instrumental in protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with environmental regulations. In recent years, there have been several court orders related to plastic recycling units in India. This article summarizes three such court orders.

The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mr. Deevik Garg under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Mr. Garg had submitted an application for setting up a recycling plastic unit, which was granted permission by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, under the Export Oriented Scheme 2004-09. The permission was given for a period of five years with certain conditions. However, when Mr. Garg applied for re-classification of land for the purpose of continuing the usage of his land for the plastic recycling unit, his representation was not considered by the respondents. Mr. Garg then filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to consider his representation. The court ordered the respondents to consider Mr. Garg's representation.

The second court order pertains to a plastic recycling unit that had applied for consent from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to continue its manufacturing process. The unit had suffered a setback in 2011 and was unable to meet its export obligations, but continued to supply pet flakes to local markets. The Pollution Control Board issued a show cause notice and rejected the unit's application without considering it. The unit filed appeals, and the Pollution Control Board sought a direction from the Appellate Authority to put up an effluent treatment plant. The unit complied and set up the plant at a cost of Rs. 30 lakhs. The appeals are still pending, and the unit has sent a representation to the government stating that it has set up an effluent plant and there is no discharge of waste in and around the unit. The court order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The third court order directs the government to consider the representation of a recycling unit after affording them an opportunity and taking into consideration the ecological damage. The unit claims that it is not situated in the catchment area and had been wrongly classified. The court has directed the respondents to consider the representation, conduct an enquiry, and pass appropriate orders within eight weeks. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the claim made by the petitioner.

These court orders highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the role of the judiciary in ensuring that industries do not cause harm to the environment. The courts have directed the respondents to consider the representations made by the petitioners and to take appropriate action. It is important for industries to comply with environmental regulations and to take steps to mitigate any harm caused to the environment. The courts have played a crucial role in ensuring that industries comply with environmental regulations and in protecting the environment.
