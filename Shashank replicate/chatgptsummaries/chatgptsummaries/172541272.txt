The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Indore recently dismissed a petition filed by a petitioner seeking to quash an order passed by ASJ, Barwani in criminal revision No.34/2018. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the production of certain documents, which was rejected by the ASJ. The petitioner had challenged this rejection in the High Court.

However, the High Court dismissed the petition, stating that there was no illegality or infirmity committed by the Courts below in passing the impugned orders. This means that the ASJ's decision to reject the petitioner's application for the production of documents was upheld by the High Court.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner had argued that the documents he sought were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial and that the ASJ had erred in rejecting his application.

However, the High Court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments and held that the ASJ had not committed any illegality or infirmity in rejecting the application. The Court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the person in possession of the documents.

The dismissal of the petition by the High Court means that the petitioner will not be able to obtain the documents he sought through the Section 91 application. It also serves as a reminder that courts will not interfere with the decisions of lower courts unless there is a clear illegality or infirmity in the decision-making process.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and making a strong case when seeking the production of documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. It also underscores the need for litigants to exhaust all other avenues before resorting to such applications, as courts are unlikely to grant them unless they are convinced of their necessity.
