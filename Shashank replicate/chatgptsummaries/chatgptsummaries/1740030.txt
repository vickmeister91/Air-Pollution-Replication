The court order in question pertains to a revision petition against the order of the Rent Controller staying the proceedings under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The petitioners had filed an ejectment petition against the respondents on various grounds, which was allowed by the Rent Controller but set aside by the Appellate Authority. The present ejectment petition was filed after about 9 1/2 years, claiming the ejectment of the respondent on the ground of impairment of value and utility of the premises and on the ground of building having become unfit and unsafe for human habitation. The respondents objected to the petition, stating that it is liable to be stayed under section 10 of the Civil Procedure.

The court held that the ejectment petition cannot be stayed merely because the revision petition is pending in this Court arising out of the earlier ejectment petition. The court allowed the revision petition and directed the Rent Controller to decide the ejectment petition in accordance with the law, taking into consideration the judgment of the earlier proceedings.

To provide some context, Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with the stay of a suit or proceeding in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit or proceeding between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit or proceeding is pending in the same or any other court in India having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed.

In this case, the respondents had argued that the ejectment petition should be stayed under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure as the matter in issue was also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit or proceeding between the same parties. However, the court held that the mere pendency of a revision petition arising out of the earlier ejectment petition does not automatically stay the proceedings under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure.

The court further noted that the Rent Controller had already allowed the earlier ejectment petition filed by the petitioners, which was subsequently set aside by the Appellate Authority. The present ejectment petition was filed after about 9 1/2 years, claiming the ejectment of the respondent on the ground of impairment of value and utility of the premises and on the ground of building having become unfit and unsafe for human habitation.

The court observed that the Rent Controller would have to decide the present ejectment petition in accordance with the law, taking into consideration the judgment of the earlier proceedings. The court also noted that the respondents had not raised any new grounds or objections in the present ejectment petition that were not already considered and decided in the earlier proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order in question allowed the revision petition and directed the Rent Controller to decide the ejectment petition in accordance with the law, taking into consideration the judgment of the earlier proceedings. The court held that the mere pendency of a revision petition arising out of the earlier ejectment petition does not automatically stay the proceedings under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure. The court also noted that the Rent Controller would have to consider the present ejectment petition in light of the earlier proceedings and that the respondents had not raised any new grounds or objections that were not already considered and decided in the earlier proceedings.
