The Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society filed a petition seeking to quash an order that any vehicle not fitted with a Speed Governing device would not be eligible for inspection for determining its fitness. The State Government required the installation of Speed Governing devices in accordance with SRO 50 dated 16.02.2016, which was issued pursuant to the directions of the Apex Court in M. C. Mehta v. Union of India & Ors. 

The court found that the requirement to install Speed Governing devices was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and rules framed thereunder. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioners cannot refuse to comply with the requirement of rules requiring the installation of such devices only on the excuse that no vendors have been approved for the Leh District.

The Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society had filed a petition in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court seeking to quash an order that any vehicle not fitted with a Speed Governing device would not be eligible for inspection for determining its fitness. The State Government had required the installation of Speed Governing devices in accordance with SRO 50 dated 16.02.2016, which was issued pursuant to the directions of the Apex Court in M. C. Mehta v. Union of India & Ors.

The Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society had argued that the requirement to install Speed Governing devices was not in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and rules framed thereunder. They had also argued that no vendors had been approved for the Leh District, and therefore, they could not comply with the requirement of rules requiring the installation of such devices.

The court, however, found that the requirement to install Speed Governing devices was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and rules framed thereunder. The court noted that the purpose of the Speed Governing devices was to ensure that vehicles do not exceed the prescribed speed limit, which is necessary for the safety of passengers and other road users.

The court also noted that the installation of Speed Governing devices had been directed by the Apex Court in M. C. Mehta v. Union of India & Ors. The court observed that the Apex Court had directed the installation of Speed Governing devices in all commercial vehicles, and the State Government had issued SRO 50 dated 16.02.2016, in compliance with the directions of the Apex Court.

The court further observed that the requirement to install Speed Governing devices was not a new requirement, and it had been in force for several years. The court noted that the Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society had been given sufficient time to comply with the requirement, and they could not refuse to comply with the requirement of rules requiring the installation of such devices only on the excuse that no vendors had been approved for the Leh District.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society, stating that the requirement to install Speed Governing devices was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and rules framed thereunder. The court also observed that the Ladakh Cooperative Transport Society could not refuse to comply with the requirement of rules requiring the installation of such devices only on the excuse that no vendors had been approved for the Leh District.
