The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by M/s. Sri Murugan Dyeing against the order of the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control, which dismissed their application for consent to operate a dyeing unit and discharge trade effluent. The appellant unit had submitted revised applications for consent, but the Board refused to grant it due to the unit's location within 1 km of the Noyyal River and in a mixed residential zone. The appellant unit had also become a member of the Kasipalayam Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), but the CETP did not have consent from the Board. The Tribunal heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the appeal.

The court order discusses the appellant's attempts to obtain consent from the Board for their dyeing unit. The unit is located within 1 km of the Noyyal River, which is prohibited by government orders. The appellant applied to shift the unit to a new location, but this was also within the prohibited distance. The Board rejected the application, and the appellant appealed to the Appellate Authority and the Tribunal, but their appeals were dismissed. The court upholds the rejection of the application and dismisses the appeals.

The appellant's application for consent to the respondent Board was rejected due to the new location being in a mixed residential zone and within 300m of the Noyyal River. The appellant appealed to the Appellate Authority and then to the NGT, arguing that the unit was an existing one and therefore the distance criteria did not apply. However, the Tribunal found that the unit had never been granted consent to operate and therefore could not be considered an existing unit. The appeals were dismissed.

In summary, M/s. Sri Murugan Dyeing had submitted revised applications for consent to operate their dyeing unit and discharge trade effluent, but the Board refused to grant it due to the unit's location within 1 km of the Noyyal River and in a mixed residential zone. The appellant unit had also become a member of the Kasipalayam Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), but the CETP did not have consent from the Board. The appellant appealed to the Appellate Authority and the Tribunal, but their appeals were dismissed. The court upheld the rejection of the application and dismissed the appeals, stating that the unit had never been granted consent to operate and therefore could not be considered an existing unit.
