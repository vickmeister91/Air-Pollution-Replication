The court recently heard a case where the petitioners were granted a quarry lease for road metal in a village in Andhra Pradesh. However, the Divisional Forest Officer informed the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology that the land on which the lease for quarrying operations was granted is part of reserved forest and suggested initiating action for cancellation of the mining leases granted. The court found that the land was wrongly shown as unreserved forest and illegally quarrying operations were permitted in an area, which is classified as forest without due compliance of the requirements of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court ordered a deeper investigation into the matter and stated that non-forestry activity cannot be permitted in forest area nor an area can be derecognized from reserved forest/forest unless prior consent of the Central Government is obtained. The court emphasized that any commercial exploitation of forest land, particularly for non-forest purposes, must be in strict compliance with statutory mandates and only in the larger public interest.

The Kondapalli forest was notified as a reserved forest in 1882, and even though Sy.No.143 was carved out, it is still described as forest land. The court order states that there has been no change in the classification of land, but a mistake has been rectified. The court notes that the quarry leases granted on forest land without prior consent of the Central Government were void ab initio, and the petitioners are not entitled to carry on quarry operations.

The court further states that writ remedy is an equity remedy, and discretion is vested in the writ court to refuse to grant relief in a case where justice and larger public interest require denial of such relief as compared to a grievance of an individual. The court also upholds the decision of the Divisional Forest Officer to cancel licenses granted for quarry operations in a forest area, as it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the forest.

The court order states that in cases where a statutory provision is intended for individual benefit, it can be waived, but if it is intended to protect public interest, it cannot be waived. The petitioners may file objections to the show cause notices issued by the Deputy Director, but quarry operations cannot continue until a final decision is made. The writ petitions are dismissed, and there is no order as to costs.

In summary, the court found that the land on which the quarry lease was granted was part of reserved forest, and quarrying operations were permitted illegally without due compliance of the requirements of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court ordered a deeper investigation into the matter and emphasized that any commercial exploitation of forest land must be in strict compliance with statutory mandates and only in the larger public interest.
