The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Sri Sangama Rice Industries against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The petitioner had challenged the refusal of consent for operation under the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974, and the subsequent disconnection of power supply. The court observed that an efficacious remedy of preferring an appeal under Section 28 of the said Act of 1974 is available to the petitioner and disposed of the petition on this ground. All contentions on merits are kept open.

The petitioner, Sri Sangama Rice Industries, had filed a writ petition challenging the refusal of consent for operation under the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974, and the subsequent disconnection of power supply. The petitioner contended that the KSPCB had not given any reasons for the refusal of consent and that the disconnection of power supply was arbitrary and illegal. The petitioner also contended that the KSPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while passing the order.

The KSPCB, on the other hand, contended that the petitioner had not complied with the conditions of the consent order and that the disconnection of power supply was a consequence of the non-compliance. The KSPCB also contended that the petitioner had an efficacious remedy of preferring an appeal under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974, and that the writ petition was not maintainable.

The court observed that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the KSPCB before the appellate authority under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974. The court further observed that an efficacious remedy of preferring an appeal under Section 28 of the said Act of 1974 is available to the petitioner. The court, therefore, disposed of the writ petition on this ground.

The court also observed that all contentions on merits are kept open. This means that the petitioner can challenge the order of the KSPCB on merits before the appellate authority under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act, 1974. The court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case.
