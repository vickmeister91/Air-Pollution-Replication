The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving violations of environmental laws and regulations by project proponents in India. The first order pertains to a case filed by Shri Tanaji Balasaheb Gambhire against M/s. Goel Ganga Developers India Pvt. Ltd. for violating environmental clearance and municipal laws. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the project proponent to pay environmental compensation cost of Rs. 100 crores or 5% of the total cost of the project, and a sum of Rs. 5 crores for contravening mandatory provisions of several environmental laws. The NGT also directed the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board to take appropriate action against the project proponent. The project proponent filed an appeal against the NGT order, which was partly allowed by the Supreme Court. The court allowed the project proponent to challenge the order passed in the review application and also allowed an amendment of the grounds of appeal.

The second court order pertains to a dispute over the interpretation of the term "built-up area" in an environmental clearance (EC) granted to a project proponent for a group housing project in Pune. The project involved the construction of 12 buildings with 552 flats, 50 shops, and 34 offices, with a total built-up area of 57,658.42 sq. m. The EC was granted subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and other stipulated conditions. The main dispute was whether the term "built-up area" covered all constructed areas or only those areas covered by the Floor Space Index (FSI). The court examined the Development Control Rules for Pune Municipal Corporation, Pune, 1982, and other relevant provisions and held that the project proponent had not constructed the built-up area of 57,658.42 sq. mtrs. as permitted under the EC.

The third court order pertains to the definition of "built up area" in relation to environmental clearance (EC) for construction projects. The court clarifies that all constructed area, whether FSI or non-FSI, which is covered and not open to the sky, has to be treated as "built up area" under the EIA Notification of 2006. The court also notes that the concept of FSI or non-FSI has no concern or connection with the grant of EC. The court further discusses a notification issued in 2011 which defines "built up area" as all constructed area including basement and service areas without any exception. The court concludes that the definition of "built up area" is clear and covers all constructed area not open to the sky.

The fourth court order quashes an office memorandum that attempted to introduce the concept of built-up area as understood in building bye-laws or Development Control Regulations into a statutory notification issued by the Central Government in 2006. The court also finds that officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change have issued clarificatory communications that nullify statutory provisions and notifications. The court upholds the National Green Tribunal's conclusion that certain officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation were going out of their way to help the project proponent at the cost of the environment. The court refrains from commenting on the conduct of officials in their individual capacity.

The fifth court order sets aside a communication dated May 31, 2016, and directs the Chief Secretary to file a detailed report on the conduct of the then Principal Secretary of the Department of Environment to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) within three months. The order also discusses the principles governing the exercise of review jurisdiction before the NGT and emphasizes that a review application should be heard by the same bench that originally decided the matter, unless it is impossible or impracticable for the earlier bench to hear the matter. The power of review is to be sparingly used and exercised only when there is an error apparent on the face of the record.

The sixth court order discusses a case where a project proponent violated environmental laws by constructing more buildings and flats than permitted. The court decided that demolition of the already constructed flats would cause too much financial loss to innocent parties, so the project proponent was only allowed to complete construction of the already occupied flats and shops. The court also decided that damages should be awarded to the original applicant, but rejected the use of the "Carbon Footprint" method for assessing damages. Instead, the court awarded damages based on the general law of 5% of the project cost, but increased the damages due to the project proponent's unapologetic behavior.

The seventh court order has ordered the project proponent to pay damages of Rs. 100 crores or 10% of the project cost, whichever is more, for constructing more buildings and flats than allowed under the environmental clearance. The project proponent must also pay an additional Rs. 5 crores for violating environmental laws. The court has upheld the original order that the construction was in violation of the environmental clearance and imposed a fine on the PMC and directed them to take appropriate action against the erring officials. The project proponent is not permitted to construct two buildings with 454 tenements and can only complete construction of a total of 807 flats, 117 shops/offices, and cultural center including club house. The project proponent must deposit the amount of damages imposed within six months, or their assets will
