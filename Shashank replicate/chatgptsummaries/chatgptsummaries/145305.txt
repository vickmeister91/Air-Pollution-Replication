The Madras High Court has issued a common order in response to four writ petitions filed by various residents' welfare associations and advocates seeking relief from pollution caused by the handling of coal and iron ore at the Chennai and Ennore ports. The court has taken up all the petitions for a common hearing and has noted that the right to life includes the right to a clean and healthy environment. The court has also provided background information on the ports and the coal handling operations.

The petitioners have requested that the handling of coal and iron ore be shifted from Chennai Port Trust to Ennore Port to reduce pollution in the surrounding areas. The Chennai Port Trust has objected, stating that it would adversely affect trade and revenue. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board has stated that they have already shifted their coal handling operations to Ennore Port. The Ennore Port Limited has provided details of their plans to handle coal and iron ore with pollution mitigating stipulations. A joint inspection team has recommended that coal and iron ore should only be handled at Ennore Port to avoid pollution and congestion at Chennai Port Trust. The Chennai Port Trust has stated various measures taken to combat pollution.

The court appointed a committee to inspect the port and found that the measures taken by the port were inadequate and the situation continued to deteriorate. The court emphasized the right to life and a clean environment as a fundamental right of citizens and criticized the port's callous attitude towards combating pollution. The port argued that shifting coal activities to Ennore port would result in financial loss.

The court finds that the measures taken by the port to address the pollution are inadequate and that the health and safety of the millions of people living in the surrounding areas cannot be ignored. The court also notes that the Ennore Port was developed to handle dusty cargoes and that the Chennai Port Trust's argument that shifting operations to Ennore Port would lead to unrest among employees and pensioners cannot be accepted. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The court has directed the government to distribute cargoes between Ennore Port and Chennai Port, allotting clean cargoes to Chennai Port and dusty cargoes to Ennore Port. The Ennore Port is directed to treat employees of Chennai Port connected to dusty cargo activities as its employees, including pensioners. The traders' rights and interests are also to be protected. The court has dismissed the compensation aspect of the case and no costs are awarded.
