The Bombay High Court recently heard a case involving Orient Syntex Limited and its directors, who were accused of committing an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for dishonouring a cheque. The complainant, Besant Capital Tech Limited, had issued a notice demanding payment, which was not complied with, leading to a complaint being filed. The court considered whether the other directors of the company, who were not actively involved in its day-to-day operations, could be held liable for the offence.

The court held that for vicarious liability to arise, the directors must have been in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business at the time the offence was committed. The court quashed the proceedings against the directors who were not actively involved in the company's operations. This decision was based on the fact that these directors did not have any direct involvement in the act or omission complained of, nor did they act dishonestly or unreasonably. 

In another case, a company and its directors were issued a process for dishonouring a cheque. The company's legal advisor, who was also a director, argued that he had no control over the company's day-to-day activities and should not be held liable. The court considered previous cases and held that unless a director is directly involved in the act or omission complained of or had otherwise not acted honestly or reasonably or had financial involvement in the company, they should be relieved of the consequences of the defaults or breaches. 

However, the court also noted that the complainant had made specific allegations against the directors and, therefore, the process against them was justified. The court also discussed the scheme of the Amending Act (56 of 1983) which introduced penalties for dishonoring certain cheques for insufficiency of funds in the accounts.

The court order further discusses the liability of individuals in a company for the offence of dishonouring a cheque under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court explains that if a company commits this offence, every person who was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business at the time of the offence can be deemed guilty and punished accordingly. The court also notes that the necessary ingredients for this offence are the dishonour of a cheque issued for the discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability, and failure to make payment within 15 days of receiving notice of the dishonour. The court ultimately finds that the necessary requirements for issuing process against the accused have been fulfilled.

In yet another case, the court order states that the accused, who are directors of a company, are liable to be punished for committing an offense under section 138 of the NI Act. This is because they had the power to borrow money from the complainant company and were responsible for the conduct of the business. The court finds no error in the previous order and dismisses the petition.

In summary, these court orders deal with cases involving the dishonour of cheques and the liability of directors in such cases. The courts have held that for vicarious liability to arise, the directors must have been in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business at the time the offence was committed. The courts have also noted that unless a director is directly involved in the act or omission complained of or had otherwise not acted honestly or reasonably or had financial involvement in the company, they should be relieved of the consequences of the defaults or breaches. However, if specific allegations are made against the directors, the process against them may be justified. The courts have also emphasized the necessary ingredients for the offence of dishonouring a cheque and the penalties for such offences.
