In a recent case, the court sentenced Mohd Hasin to two years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 15,000 for possession of a tiger skin under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The defense counsel argued for leniency due to the convict's age, profession, family circumstances, and lack of previous convictions. However, the court considered these arguments but still imposed the sentence.

The case highlights the importance of wildlife protection laws in India and the consequences of violating them. The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violation of the act can result in imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Mohd Hasin was found in possession of a tiger skin, which is a violation of the act. The court took a serious view of the matter and imposed a two-year imprisonment sentence and a fine of Rs. 15,000. The sentence serves as a warning to others who may consider violating wildlife protection laws.

The defense counsel argued for leniency, citing the convict's age, profession, family circumstances, and lack of previous convictions. However, the court considered these arguments but still imposed the sentence. The court's decision shows that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their age, profession, or family circumstances.

The convict was given the benefit of section 428 Cr.P.C, which allows for the period of detention undergone during the investigation, inquiry, or trial to be set off against the sentence of imprisonment. This means that the convict will serve a reduced sentence due to the time already spent in detention.

The court also provided a copy of the judgment and order to the convict free of cost. This is a standard practice in Indian courts to ensure that the convict understands the reasons for their sentence and can appeal if necessary.

In conclusion, the court's decision to sentence Mohd Hasin to two years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 15,000 for possession of a tiger skin under the Wild Life (Protection) Act highlights the importance of wildlife protection laws in India. The sentence serves as a warning to others who may consider violating these laws. The court's decision also shows that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their age, profession, or family circumstances. The convict was given the benefit of section 428 Cr.P.C, and a copy of the judgment and order was given to him free of cost.
