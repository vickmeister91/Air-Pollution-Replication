In a recent court order, Mukesh was convicted under section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for possessing mongoose hairs and a tiger skin without a valid license. The prosecution presented evidence from several witnesses, including a wildlife inspector and police officers, to prove the allegations against Mukesh. The defense argued that Mukesh was innocent and falsely implicated in the case, but the court found the prosecution's evidence to be reliable and convicted Mukesh.

The court order states that Mukesh did not deny that a raid was conducted by police officials and a PFA activist, and that a bunch of mongoose hairs were recovered from his possession. The raid was conducted on the night of 08/09.12.06, and although some locals gathered at the spot, it is not expected for a public person to join a raid in the late night. The raid and seizure of the mongoose hairs from the accused's possession are evident from the seizure memo, which bears the accused's thumb impression. The accused did not lead any defense evidence or bring anything on record to disprove the prosecution story. Therefore, the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused, and he is convicted for the offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act.
