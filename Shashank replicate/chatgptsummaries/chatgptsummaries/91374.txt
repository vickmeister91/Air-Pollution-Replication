The court order in question pertains to a case involving Anandan K.S., who was charged with an offence under section 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Kerala Forest Amendment Act, 1993, and section 52 read with section 9(1)(2) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The petitioner challenged the conviction before the Sessions Court in Manjeri in Crl. Appeal 478 of 2005, which was dismissed.
