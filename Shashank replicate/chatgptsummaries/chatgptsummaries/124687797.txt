The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Kalai Tudu against the State of Jharkhand and other officials. Tudu had been settled a portion of land in 1997, and the settlement was still continuing in his favor. However, a notification was issued in 2013 permitting seed plantation in the same plot of land. Tudu filed the writ petition seeking the quashing of the notification and direction to continue the "BANDOBASTI" in favor of raiyats.

The court found that the settlement was still continuing in Tudu's favor, and the notification interfered with his enjoyment of the property. The court set aside the notification only to the extent that it related to Tudu's property and restrained the respondents from interfering with his rights over the property. However, the order would not prevent the respondents from initiating any proceedings if the settlement was found to be done by virtue of any misrepresentation or factual error.
