In a recent court order, Prem Kumar @ Pachiappa was acquitted of charges under Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, for allegedly smuggling 1428 cobra snake skins from Madras to Delhi. The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused, and the case property was confiscated to the state.

The case against Prem Kumar was brought under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, which aims to protect wildlife and their habitats from poaching, hunting, and other illegal activities. The Act provides for strict penalties for those found guilty of violating its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, the prosecution alleged that Prem Kumar had smuggled 1428 cobra snake skins from Madras to Delhi, in violation of the Act. The prosecution presented evidence in support of its case, including witness testimony and physical evidence.

However, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused. The court noted that the prosecution had not been able to establish a clear chain of custody for the case property, which raised doubts about the authenticity of the evidence presented.

In addition, the court found that the prosecution had not been able to establish the identity of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that the prosecution had relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, which was not sufficient to establish guilt.

As a result, the court acquitted Prem Kumar of all charges under Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court also ordered that the case property be confiscated to the state.

In another court order, announced by ACMM (Special) Acts, Central, Tis Hazari Courts Delhi on June 7, 2011, a case between WLI and Prem Kumar was discussed regarding Ajay Gupta. However, no further information was provided to summarize the case.

Overall, the court order in the case against Prem Kumar highlights the importance of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases. The court's decision to acquit the accused underscores the need for prosecutors to present strong and convincing evidence in support of their case, in order to secure a conviction.
