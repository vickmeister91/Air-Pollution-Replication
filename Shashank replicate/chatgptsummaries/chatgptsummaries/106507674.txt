The court recently dismissed two criminal revision cases filed by Shri Bharat Bhai Patel against Smt. Radha Agrawal. The complainant had given two cheques to the applicant, which were dishonored. The respondent filed an application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in both cases, seeking the complainant's income tax returns and account books of the last five years. The court directed the applicant to produce the required documents or file an affidavit stating that they do not exist. The court confirmed the orders passed by the learned JMFC, Jabalpur, and dismissed the revisions filed by the applicant.

The case involved a dispute between Shri Bharat Bhai Patel and Smt. Radha Agrawal over two dishonored cheques. The respondent, Smt. Radha Agrawal, filed an application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. seeking the complainant's income tax returns and account books of the last five years. The court directed the applicant to produce the required documents or file an affidavit stating that they do not exist.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also provides that the court may require the person to whom the summons or order is directed to produce the document or thing in court or before an officer specified in the summons or order.

In this case, the respondent sought the complainant's income tax returns and account books of the last five years to establish his financial position and to ascertain whether he had the means to pay the amount due under the dishonored cheques. The court directed the applicant to produce the required documents or file an affidavit stating that they do not exist.

The court confirmed the orders passed by the learned JMFC, Jabalpur, and dismissed the revisions filed by the applicant. The learned JMFC had earlier directed the applicant to pay the amount due under the dishonored cheques and had also directed him to produce the required documents. The applicant had challenged these orders by filing two criminal revision cases, which were dismissed by the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of complying with court orders and producing the required documents. Failure to comply with court orders can result in serious consequences, including dismissal of the case or imposition of penalties. It is therefore important for litigants to take court orders seriously and to comply with them in a timely and efficient manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of complying with court orders and producing the required documents. The respondent's application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. seeking the complainant's income tax returns and account books of the last five years was a legitimate request aimed at establishing the complainant's financial position and ascertaining whether he had the means to pay the amount due under the dishonored cheques. The court's decision to dismiss the revisions filed by the applicant underscores the need for litigants to take court orders seriously and to comply with them in a timely and efficient manner.
