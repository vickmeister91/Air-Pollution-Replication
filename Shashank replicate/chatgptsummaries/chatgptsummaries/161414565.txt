The Supreme Court of India recently made a decision in the case of Nitya Dharmananda @ K. Lenin versus Gopal Sheelum Reddy alias Nithya Bhaktananda. The respondent was charged with offences under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court of Karnataka had allowed the respondent's application to summon the entire material available with the investigator, which was not made part of the chargesheet, under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the Supreme Court has now set aside this decision and allowed the appeal of Nitya Dharmananda.

The Supreme Court held that while ordinarily the Court has to proceed on the basis of material produced with the charge sheet for dealing with the issue of charge, if the court is satisfied that there is material of sterling quality which has been withheld by the investigator/prosecutor, the court is not debarred from summoning or relying upon the same even if such document is not a part of the charge sheet. This means that if there is important evidence that has been withheld by the investigator or prosecutor, the court can still consider it even if it is not part of the chargesheet.

The trial court may now proceed to deal with the issue of framing of charge in the light of the observations made by the Supreme Court and also to proceed with the matter expeditiously in accordance with law. This means that the trial court can now consider all the evidence available, including any evidence that was not part of the chargesheet, and make a decision on whether to proceed with the charges against the respondent.

In addition to this decision, the court also granted permission to file annexures and heard various lawyers representing both the petitioner and respondent. The court granted leave and disposed of the appeals in accordance with a signed reportable order. Any pending applications were also disposed of.

Overall, this decision by the Supreme Court of India has clarified the rules around the use of evidence in criminal cases. While the court will usually rely on the evidence presented in the chargesheet, it is not limited to this evidence and can consider other evidence if it is of high quality and has been withheld by the investigator or prosecutor. This decision will have implications for future criminal cases in India and will help to ensure that all relevant evidence is considered in the pursuit of justice.
