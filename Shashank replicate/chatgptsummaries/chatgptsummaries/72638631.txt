The recent court order pertains to a case involving Bharti Infratel Limited, a company that provides telecommunication services and maintains assets such as mobile towers. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had served notices to the company stating that the diesel generators used at their sites fell under the category of "industrial plant" and required prior authorization under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Additionally, the Pollution Board demanded a fee of Rs. 25,000 per diesel generator set for five years for handling hazardous wastes.

Bharti Infratel Limited raised objections against the applicability of the Act and Rules and challenged the notices served by the Pollution Board. The company argued that the diesel generators were not industrial plants and did not require prior authorization under the Act. They also contended that the fee demanded by the Pollution Board was arbitrary and excessive.

The court directed the Pollution Board to decide on the objections raised by Bharti Infratel Limited before taking any action. The court also noted that the Pollution Board had not considered the objections raised by the company and had not given them an opportunity to be heard. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice must be followed, and the Pollution Board must provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to the company to present their case.

The court further observed that the Pollution Board had not provided any reasons for the fee demanded by them. The court noted that the fee demanded by the Pollution Board was not based on any scientific or rational basis and was arbitrary. The court directed the Pollution Board to reconsider the fee demanded by them and provide reasons for the same.

The court also noted that the Pollution Board had not considered the fact that Bharti Infratel Limited had already obtained necessary permissions and licenses from the concerned authorities. The court directed the Pollution Board to take into account all the relevant factors before taking any action against the company.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the case involving Bharti Infratel Limited and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and providing a fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard. The court also emphasizes the need for the Pollution Board to provide reasons for any fee demanded by them and to consider all relevant factors before taking any action against a company.
