The court order pertains to three petitions that share common questions of law and facts. The petitioner, Kalyani Industries, had received permission from various authorities to construct a cement hollow brick factory in Gopalpur village, Warangal District. However, the General Manager of the District Industries Centre requested the petitioner to shift the industry to a non-residential locality within three months. The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board also issued an order to close the unit for violating the conditions imposed. The controversy involves allegations of air, water, and noise pollution caused by the petitioner's industry.

To investigate the matter, the court appointed an advocate-commissioner to visit the spot and submit a report, which became part of the evidence. The court found that the impugned proceedings of the General Manager had no legal basis and should be quashed. However, the petitioner's industry was causing both sound and dust pollution, and the Board had the power to prevent and take action against those who violated the provisions by causing air pollution.

The court suggested that the petitioner should approach the appellate authority under Section 31 of the Air Act to challenge the impugned proceedings of the Board for disposal in accordance with the law. The court also discussed the A.P. Urban Areas (Development) Act, 1975, which includes the construction of any building for the purpose of the factory within the area defined as a development area under the Act.

According to the court order, any development plan or master plan already prepared and sanctioned by the government before the commencement of the Act shall be deemed to be a master plan subject to necessary alterations. It is mandatory for anyone seeking permission for development in the declared development area to obtain approval from the authority. The petitioner did not obtain such approval, and the impugned orders were passed under Section 42 of the Act.

The court allowed WP No.4501/95 and quashed the impugned proceedings, but WP No.7700/95 and WP No. 118/96 were disposed of with an observation that the petitioner was not entitled to any relief in these petitions. The petitioner shall be entitled to exhaust the remedies of appeal to the appropriate authorities as indicated in the observations made above. Such appeals shall be disposed of within three months from the date of receipt of this order or from the date of preferring the appeal, as the case may be.

In summary, the court order deals with a case where a petitioner's industry is causing pollution and violating conditions imposed by the Board. The court found that the impugned proceedings of the General Manager had no legal basis and should be quashed. However, the petitioner's industry was causing both sound and dust pollution, and the Board had the power to prevent and take action against those who violated the provisions by causing air pollution. The court suggested that the petitioner should approach the appellate authority under Section 31 of the Air Act to challenge the impugned proceedings of the Board for disposal in accordance with the law.
