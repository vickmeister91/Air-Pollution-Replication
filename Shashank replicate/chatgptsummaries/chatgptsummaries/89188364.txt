The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where the defendant, Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. (ONGC), caused damage to the plaintiff's land and crops due to the spillage or overflowing of an oil well. In the first case, the plaintiff claimed damages of Rs. 23,26,900/= with interest at 9% per annum from the date of the suit till the amount is realized by the plaintiff. The court awarded the plaintiff this amount, but the defendant challenged the judgment in the present appeal, arguing that the compensation paid was sufficient and that the plaintiff had no locus standi to file the suit.

In the second case, the defendant chose not to examine any witnesses, and the court based its decision on the deposition of the plaintiff and his witnesses. The court held that the defendant had a strict legal requirement to take proper care and caution in respect of the well, and any damage to a third person on account of blowing out of the well would give rise to the actionable claim of damages. The court referred to case laws on strict liabilities under the Tort. Ultimately, the court upheld the trial court's decision to grant damages to the plaintiff.

The third court order discusses the legal definition of negligence and the concept of strict liability. Negligence is defined as a breach of a legal duty to take care, which results in damage. Strict liability applies to hazardous activities that pose a constant danger to others, and the undertakers of these activities must compensate for damages caused, irrespective of any fault. The doctrine of strict liability originated in the case of Rylands v. Fletcher, where the defendants were held liable for damages caused by the escape of water from their reservoir. The court also notes that the rule of Rylands v. Fletcher was further developed in the case of M.C. Mehta v. Union of India to adequately deal with the problems arising in a highly industrialized economy.

In the fourth case, the court order discusses the principle of strict liability in cases where an enterprise engages in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, and harm results to anyone due to an accident. The defendant in this case had dug an oil well, which caused damage to the plaintiff's land and crops. The court held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damages caused and that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation. However, the court also emphasized the need for the plaintiff to prove the quantification of damages and not rely solely on the defendant's failure to rebut the evidence.

In the fifth case, the court order states that the defendant failed to provide evidence to rebut the plaintiff's claims for compensation for damages to crops and land. The court found that the defendant's calculation of damages lacked rationale and failed to produce evidence to support their position. The court also found discrepancies in the plaintiff's evidence, but ultimately worked out compensation based on available details and settled legal principles. The court limited the amount of compensation for damages to the land and crops due to a lack of concrete proof.

In the final court order, the court reduced the compensation amount to Rs. 8,49,000 with 9% interest per annum, to be paid by the Corporation to the appellant from the date of filing of the suit till the date of payment. The appeal is partly allowed. The court has directed that the compensation must be paid within three months from the date of receipt of the court order. The records are to be sent back to the trial court.

In summary, all of these court orders deal with cases where ONGC caused damage to the plaintiff's land and crops due to the spillage or overflowing of an oil well. The court held ONGC strictly liable for the damages caused and awarded compensation to the plaintiffs. However, the court also emphasized the need for the plaintiffs to prove the quantification of damages and not rely solely on the defendant's failure to rebut the evidence. The court orders also discuss the legal definition of negligence and the concept of strict liability, which applies to hazardous activities that pose a constant danger to others. Ultimately, the court orders provide a framework for holding enterprises accountable for damages caused by their hazardous activities.
