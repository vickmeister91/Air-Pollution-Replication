The court order in question pertains to a research project aimed at exploring the effective implementation of laws related to Mines and Mineral Act, Forest, Wild Life (Protection) Act, and Environment (Protection) Act in the state of Jharkhand. The order was issued by the court to the Director of Judicial Academy, who was directed to prepare a concept note and suggest effective measures for the implementation of these laws. The Director was also instructed to collaborate with officers from various departments and submit the concept note by 20.11.2019.

However, as there was no response from the officers, the court modified the order to allow the Director to collaborate with the National University of Study and Research in Law, Ranchi, and submit the concept note by 16.12.2019.

However, their implementation has been a challenge due to various factors, including lack of awareness, inadequate resources, and corruption.

By commissioning this research project, the court is taking a proactive approach to address these challenges and identify effective measures for the implementation of these laws. The involvement of the Director of Judicial Academy and the National University of Study and Research in Law, Ranchi, ensures that the research will be conducted by experts in the field and will be based on sound legal principles.

Furthermore, the court's decision to modify the order to allow collaboration with the National University of Study and Research in Law, Ranchi, demonstrates its flexibility and willingness to adapt to changing circumstances. This modification ensures that the research project can proceed as planned, despite the lack of cooperation from the officers.

Overall, the court's decision to initiate this research project is a positive step towards ensuring effective implementation of laws related to Mines and Mineral Act, Forest, Wild Life (Protection) Act, and Environment (Protection) Act in the state of Jharkhand.
