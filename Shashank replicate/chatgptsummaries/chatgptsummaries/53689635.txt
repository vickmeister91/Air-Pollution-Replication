The Punjab Leather Federation recently filed a petition against The Punjab Pollution Control Board and others, which was dismissed by the court. The court order was made in accordance with the jurisdiction vested under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and others vs. Union of India and others.

The court order provides the petitioner with the liberty to avail of the remedy before the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. This means that the petitioner can approach the National Green Tribunal to seek a remedy for their grievances. The court order does not provide any relief to the petitioner, but it does not prevent them from seeking relief through other legal channels.

The Punjab Leather Federation had filed the petition against The Punjab Pollution Control Board and others, alleging that the Board had issued a notice to the petitioner for the closure of their tannery. The petitioner claimed that the notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity to be heard. The petitioner also alleged that the Board had not followed the due process of law while issuing the notice.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had not exhausted all the available remedies before approaching the court. The court also noted that the petitioner had not approached the National Green Tribunal, which is the appropriate forum to hear such matters.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. The court has made it clear that the National Green Tribunal is the appropriate forum to hear matters related to environmental issues. The court has also emphasized the need to follow due process of law while issuing notices and taking action against polluting industries.
