The court order in the case of Mst. Chunni vs State & Ors. revolves around a dispute over land ownership and ceiling proceedings initiated against respondent no. 4 under the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agriculture Holding Act, 1973. The appellant claimed that the land in question was given to her in a family partition, but the court found that the partition was not recognized under the law. The court also found that the appellant had no right to be heard in the ceiling proceedings. As a result, the court dismissed the writ petition and affirmed the orders of the Additional Collector and Board of Revenue.

The court order discusses various cases related to the rights of transferees in land ceiling proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of providing an opportunity of hearing to the transferees before determining their status and highlights the need to consider encumbered lands separately from unencumbered lands. The order also discusses a specific case where the appellant claimed a share in the land left by her deceased husband, but the court found that she had no right to it. However, the court recognized her possession of the land and declared it as encumbered, which meant that the respondent could not treat it as unencumbered land. 

The order concludes by citing a case that clarifies the meaning of encumbered land and the obligation of the landholder to surrender unencumbered land first. It states that if rights created under Sec.53A in favor of the transferor are considered as encumbrance or burden, then the obligation of the holder can be enforced, and the state can be compelled to give effect to it. The land in possession of the appellant cannot be taken possession of in the first instance, and the respondent no. 4 is under an obligation to surrender the land in his possession first. 

The court found that the appellant had no share in the land left out by her husband, and the land given to her under a family partition has to be taken into account while determining the computation of ceiling area applicable to the respondent no. 4. The appellant's possession of the land has to be treated as encumbered land, and the respondent no. 4 is under an obligation to surrender the unencumbered land in his possession. The special appeal succeeds, and the writ petition is allowed. The order impugned is set aside, and the Additional Collector, Jodhpur, is directed to take possession of the surplus land out of the unencumbered land possessed by the respondent no. 4.
