The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case involving the violation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The appellant argued that the lower court had not considered the evidence of witnesses and that the accused had violated the notification issued by the Government of India and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. However, the court cited previous decisions and principles that govern the hearing of appeals against orders of acquittal, stating that the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record. 

The court found that the complainant had failed to prove the case against the accused and upheld the order of acquittal. The prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence presented, including a newspaper cutting, was not sufficient to support the complainant's version of events. The trial court was justified in acquitting the accused, and the appellate court finds no reason to interfere with the decision. The appeal was dismissed, and bail bonds were cancelled.
