The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the pollution and encroachment of canals in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. The first court order was filed by Amar Nath Chawla against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through the district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The court issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The second court order directs the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and distributories. The State Pollution Control Board is directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The State is also directed to impose damages or compensation on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court orders the State to provide a report on the steps taken for construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. The District Collector is directed to be present with relevant records on the next hearing date. The State is warned that if they do not comply, a cost will be imposed.

The third court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures in the area meant for canal maintenance. The state government was directed to comply with the orders in letter and spirit, failing which appropriate action would be taken. Compliance reports were to be filed by specific dates. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the state government's lethargic attitude towards implementing the orders.

The fourth court order discusses compliance reports and affidavits related to encroachments on Indira Gandhi Canal and pollution of its water. The court finds that the District Administration is moving too slowly in taking action against encroachers and polluters, and orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court cites the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching a writ court, but notes that in certain cases, a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if an alternative remedy is available.

The fifth court order states that a writ court can issue a certiorari even if an appeal or revision is available, if the inferior court or tribunal has committed a patent error that cannot be cured by other remedies. However, the court may still insist on using alternative remedies if they are efficacious. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and the petitioner's claim was not yet adjudicated. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with appropriate application/representation. The NGT has the power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that canals and water sources are not polluted or encroached upon. The court has issued several directives to the State of Rajasthan to take effective measures to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and distributories, and to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court has also warned the State that if they do not comply, a cost will be imposed. It is important for the State to take these directives seriously and to take immediate action to protect the environment and the health of its citizens.
