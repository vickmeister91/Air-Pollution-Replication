Abdul Azeez, the petitioner, filed a petition for interim custody of his car, which was seized by the police for alleged offenses under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the petition, stating that the vehicle was allegedly used for transporting ivory tusks and was liable to be confiscated under Section 61A of the Kerala Forest Act. 

Abdul Azeez then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order and get the vehicle released. The High Court of Kerala allowed the petition, stating that confiscation under Section 61A of the Kerala Forest Act could only be in respect of a vehicle used for committing a forest offense, and there was no case for the prosecution that any forest offense was committed. The court directed the magistrate to pass an appropriate order in accordance with the law.
