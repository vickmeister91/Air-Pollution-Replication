The court has granted anticipatory bail to Indra Narayan Jha, who was anticipating his arrest in connection with a case of excess production without obtaining environment clearance. Jha was the agent of M/s Simlong Colliery of Eastern Coalfields Ltd. and the case was registered under Section 15 of Environment Protection Act. The court directed that Jha shall be released on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each, subject to conditions as laid down under Section 438 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The case against Jha was registered under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, which deals with the penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act. The Act aims to protect and improve the environment and to prevent hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants, and property. The Act requires that any person who wants to undertake any activity that is likely to have an adverse impact on the environment must obtain prior environmental clearance from the concerned authorities.

In this case, Jha was the agent of M/s Simlong Colliery of Eastern Coalfields Ltd. and was involved in excess production without obtaining environmental clearance. This is a serious violation of the provisions of the Environment Protection Act and can have serious consequences for the environment and the people living in the area.

Jha had applied for anticipatory bail, which is a provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of his or her arrest. The court granted Jha anticipatory bail on the condition that he furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each. The court also laid down certain conditions that Jha must comply with, as laid down under Section 438 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The conditions laid down by the court include that Jha must cooperate with the investigating agency, must not tamper with the evidence, must not leave the country without the permission of the court, and must attend all court hearings. These conditions are meant to ensure that Jha does not abscond or interfere with the investigation in any way.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Jha has been criticized by some environmental activists, who argue that it sends the wrong message and undermines the importance of environmental protection. They argue that Jha should have been arrested and prosecuted for his violation of the Environment Protection Act.

However, others argue that the grant of anticipatory bail is a legal right and that Jha has not been acquitted of the charges against him. They argue that the court has laid down strict conditions that Jha must comply with and that he will be prosecuted if he violates any of these conditions.

Overall, the grant of anticipatory bail to Indra Narayan Jha in connection with a case of excess production without obtaining environment clearance is a reminder of the importance of environmental protection and the need to comply with the provisions of the Environment Protection Act. The conditions laid down by the court ensure that Jha will not abscond or interfere with the investigation and that he will be prosecuted if he violates any of these conditions.
