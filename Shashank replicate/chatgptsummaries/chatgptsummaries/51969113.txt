The case at hand involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Surinder Kaur against an order passed by the learned Upper Sessions and District Judge No.1, Sriganganagar. The order in question rejected the revision petition No.CIS - 213/2017 and affirmed the order dated 18.05.2017 passed by learned Special Judge (NI Act Cases) No.1, Sriganganagar, whereby he rejected the application filed by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. in Criminal Case No.256/2010. The petitioner had borrowed Rs.2,00,000/- and gave a cheque bearing No.0045817 dated 23.09.2006 of Rs. 2,00,000/- drawn on Bank of India, Branch Dashmesh Nagar in favour of respondent No.2. Due to dishonouring of cheque, the proceedings were initiated.

The petitioner had sought to use Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for the production of certain documents, including the bank statement of the respondent, in order to establish her case. However, the court rejected the petition on the grounds that the petitioner had ample opportunity to make the necessary examination since 2012. The court noted that the petitioner had already been given the opportunity to cross-examine the respondent and had failed to do so. Therefore, the court deemed it unnecessary to use Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and dismissed the petition.

However, the court did allow the petitioner to call a witness regarding two cheques. This decision was made in light of the fact that the petitioner had not been given the opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the earlier stages of the case. The court also noted that the petitioner had ample opportunity to examine the matter since 2012 and had failed to do so. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition.

In conclusion, the court rejected the petitioner's request to use Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for the production of certain documents. The court noted that the petitioner had ample opportunity to examine the matter since 2012 and had failed to do so. However, the court did allow the petitioner to call a witness regarding two cheques. Ultimately, the petition was dismissed.
