The court order in question pertains to two Special Criminal Applications, one filed by the accused and the other by the complainant. The accused had submitted an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directing the complainant to produce certain documents. The learned Magistrate partly allowed the application, and the Revisional Court partly allowed the Revision Application filed by the complainant, quashing and setting aside the order passed by the learned trial Court and remanding the matter to the learned trial Court for deciding the said applications afresh.

Both the accused and the complainant filed Special Criminal Applications against the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Revisional Court. The court dismissed both applications and remanded the matter to the learned Magistrate for considering the application afresh in accordance with law and on merits and in light of the observation made in the order.

The accused had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The accused had sought the production of certain documents from the complainant, which he believed would be relevant to the case.

The learned Magistrate had partly allowed the application, directing the complainant to produce some of the documents sought by the accused. However, the Revisional Court partly allowed the Revision Application filed by the complainant, quashing and setting aside the order passed by the learned trial Court and remanding the matter to the learned trial Court for deciding the said applications afresh.

Both the accused and the complainant filed Special Criminal Applications against the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Revisional Court. The court dismissed both applications and remanded the matter to the learned Magistrate for considering the application afresh in accordance with law and on merits and in light of the observation made in the order.

The court's decision to remand the matter to the learned Magistrate for fresh consideration was based on the fact that the learned Magistrate had not considered all the relevant factors while passing the order. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had not considered the relevance and materiality of the documents sought by the accused, and had not given any reasons for partly allowing the application.

The court also observed that the Revisional Court had not considered the entire material on record while passing the order, and had not given any reasons for partly allowing the Revision Application filed by the complainant. The court held that the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Revisional Court was not sustainable in law, and therefore, needed to be set aside.

The court further held that the learned Magistrate should consider the application afresh in accordance with law and on merits, and should give reasons for the order passed. The court also directed the learned Magistrate to consider the relevance and materiality of the documents sought by the accused, and to pass a reasoned order in accordance with law.

The court dismissed both applications and remanded the matter to the learned Magistrate for considering the application afresh in accordance with law and on merits and in light of the observation made in the order.
