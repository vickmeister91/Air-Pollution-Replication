Shibu Ram Ray, who was convicted under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Arms Act, has appealed against his conviction. He was sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50,000. The appeal has been admitted for hearing, and an Amicus Curiae has been appointed to represent the appellant.

The court has ordered for relevant copies to be furnished to the Amicus Curiae and an extra copy of the appeal memo to be given to the counsel for the State/respondent. The court has also called for the LCR pertaining to Sessions Case No.145(B)/2018 from the Court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Bijni.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Arms Act, 1959, is an Indian law that regulates the possession, manufacture, sale, transport, import, and export of arms and ammunition.

Shibu Ram Ray's appeal against his conviction under these two acts is significant because it raises questions about the protection of wildlife and the regulation of arms in India. The appointment of an Amicus Curiae to represent the appellant indicates that the court is taking this appeal seriously and wants to ensure that all relevant arguments are heard.

The court's order for relevant copies to be furnished to the Amicus Curiae and an extra copy of the appeal memo to be given to the counsel for the State/respondent is a standard procedure in appeals.

The LCR, or Lower Court Records, contains all the documents related to the case, including the chargesheet, witness statements, and evidence. The higher court needs to review these records to understand the lower court's decision and the basis for the conviction.
