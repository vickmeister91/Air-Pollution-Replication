In a recent court order, an appeal filed by Jesurethinam and others against the Ministry of Environment and Forests Union of India, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and others was dismissed by the court. The respondents argued that the appeal was not maintainable as the order being challenged was passed prior to the commencement of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court agreed with the respondents and dismissed the appeal, stating that there is no inherent right to prefer an appeal and that an appeal is a creature of statute.

The court also cited Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which specifies the types of orders that can be appealed and the time limit for filing an appeal. The court held that the appeal was not maintainable and dismissed it without costs. This decision highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework within which appeals can be made and the limitations on those appeals.

The court order also mentions the names of two members, an expert member and a judicial member, without providing any further information or context. It is unclear what role these members played in the case or what their specific expertise is. However, their inclusion in the court order suggests that they may have had some influence on the court's decision.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the legal framework within which appeals can be made. It also highlights the need for transparency in court proceedings, including providing context and information about the individuals involved in the case.
