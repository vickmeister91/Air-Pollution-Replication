The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to a petition filed by Dilip Verma against the State of Madhya Pradesh regarding noise pollution caused by industries, factories, and blacksmiths within the jurisdiction of the respondent Municipality. Respondent No.2 raised a preliminary objection that the issue raised herein lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. However, the court found that noise pollution is included in the definition of nuisance under Section 3(22) of the M.P. Municipalities Act, 1961, and therefore, the Municipal Council has the power to inquire into and remove the same.

The court directed the Municipal Council to inquire into the grievance of the petitioner and remove any noise pollution found to exist. The council was given three months to comply with the order, failing which the case would be listed before the appropriate bench of the court for passing an appropriate order. The petitioner was given the liberty to move the court if the action taken report was deficient.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of addressing noise pollution, which can have serious health consequences for individuals living in affected areas. The court's decision to allow the Municipal Council to take action against noise pollution is a positive step towards addressing this issue.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework surrounding environmental issues. In this case, the court found that the Municipal Council had the power to address noise pollution under the M.P. Municipalities Act, 1961. This underscores the need for individuals and organizations to be aware of the legal avenues available to them when seeking to address environmental issues.

The court's decision also serves as a reminder of the importance of holding local authorities accountable for addressing environmental issues. The Municipal Council has been given a clear directive to address noise pollution within its jurisdiction, and failure to comply with the court's order could result in further legal action.

Overall, the court order in response to Dilip Verma's petition is a positive step towards addressing noise pollution in Madhya Pradesh. The court's decision to allow the Municipal Council to take action against noise pollution underscores the importance of understanding the legal framework surrounding environmental issues, and the court's directive to the council serves as a reminder of the importance of holding local authorities accountable for addressing environmental issues.
