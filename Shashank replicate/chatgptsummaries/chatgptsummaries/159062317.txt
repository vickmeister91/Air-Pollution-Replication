In recent court orders, individuals have been convicted for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by importing and possessing Shahtoosh shawls made from the hair of Tibetan Antelope, a protected species. The first case involved Umar Bashir Dar, who was caught with 32 Shahtoosh shawls in his baggage at the IGI Airport in New Delhi. The case was transferred to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), and the prosecution examined five witnesses, including a retired scientist from the Wildlife Forensic Cell, a superintendent from the Central Excise Department, and the Regional Deputy Director of WCCB. On April 30, 2019, the court convicted Dar for contravening the provisions of the Act and banned Schedule-I items. 

Similarly, in another case, an accused was caught with 102 shawls suspected to be made of Shahtoosh, which is a protected animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The court heard the testimony of various witnesses, including a wildlife forensic expert, and concluded that the shawls were indeed made of Shahtoosh. The accused claimed that he had purchased the shawls in India for trading, but failed to produce any proof of legal import or purchase. The court rejected the defense's arguments and found the accused guilty of violating the Wildlife Protection Act.

In a third case, an accused was found to be in possession of shawls made from the hair of a protected species of Tibetan Antelope, without any permit or license. The prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused was convicted for the offense punishable under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The case property was confiscated to the state, and a copy of the judgment was supplied to the convict.

These cases highlight the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating wildlife protection laws. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also prohibits the possession, sale, and transportation of Schedule-I animals and their products, including Shahtoosh shawls made from the hair of Tibetan Antelope.

The conviction of individuals for violating the Act sends a strong message that wildlife crimes will not be tolerated, and the law will take its course. The prosecution's use of expert witnesses, such as wildlife forensic experts, highlights the importance of scientific evidence in wildlife crime investigations and trials. 

Furthermore, the confiscation of case property to the state emphasizes the need for deterrence and the prevention of illegal trade in wildlife and their products. The supply of a copy of the judgment to the convict ensures that they are aware of the consequences of their actions and serves as a warning to others who may consider engaging in similar activities.

In conclusion, the recent court orders convicting individuals for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, demonstrate the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating wildlife protection laws. The use of expert witnesses and the confiscation of case property to the state emphasize the need for deterrence and prevention of illegal trade in wildlife and their products. These convictions send a strong message that wildlife crimes will not be tolerated, and the law will take its course.
