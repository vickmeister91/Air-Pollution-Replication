The court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Zaki Ahmad against an order passed by the 10th A.S.J & Special Judge (POSCO), Jabalpur in Special Case No.160/2017. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C to call documents from the office of the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur. The application was dismissed by the learned 10th A.S.J, Jabalpur. 

The petitioner had sought the production of certain documents from the office of the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur, under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. This section empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner had argued that the documents were necessary for his defence in the case.

However, the court held that the copies of the applications were available with the petitioner/accused, which showed that he had the original or certified copies of the same. Therefore, at this stage, exercising the powers under Section 91 of Cr.P.C, was not necessary to call these documents. The court observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents at this stage.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents from the office of the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur, before filing the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to bypass the normal procedure for obtaining documents and seek their production under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any specific averments in his application as to how the documents sought were relevant to his defence. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents at this stage.

The revision was dismissed, but it was made clear that the petitioner may seek production of these documents at a proper stage. The court observed that the petitioner could seek the production of the documents during the course of the trial, if they were found to be necessary for his defence.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Zaki Ahmad against an order passed by the 10th A.S.J & Special Judge (POSCO), Jabalpur in Special Case No.160/2017. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents sought under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C at this stage. However, the court made it clear that the petitioner may seek production of these documents at a proper stage, such as during the course of the trial, if they were found to be necessary for his defence.
