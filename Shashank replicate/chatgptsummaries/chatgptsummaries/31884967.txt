The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by the petitioners challenging the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act and the establishment of the National Green Tribunal at Pune. The lead petition, Writ Petition (PIL) No.122 of 2013, is filed by the petitioners praying for various reliefs, including restraining the respondents from diverting/blocking the flow of rivers and from constructing on river-beds, quashing and setting aside the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, and issuing a writ of mandamus to the respondent State of Gujarat to take over the areas-in-question and to restore it to its original natural conditions by removing encroachments and obstructions that are blocking/obstructing the flow of rivers.

The court order provides background information on the Mundra region and the ecological fragility of the area. The court has ordered the appointment of an independent fact-finding commission to investigate the matter of encroachments and obstructions that are blocking the flow of rivers in certain areas. The State Government has been directed to take over these areas and restore them to their original natural conditions by removing the encroachments and obstructions. The court cited regulations that prohibit development in areas designated for water bodies and stipulate a distance from water courses where no development is allowed. The court also referenced previous judgments that emphasize the importance of protecting the environment and balancing economic interests with environmental concerns.

The court order also pertains to a petition filed by the petitioners alleging destruction, bunding, blocking, and diversion of 14 rain-fed rivers in Kutch District by M/s. Adani Port and SEZ Ltd. The petitioners claim that this has resulted in flooding and loss of livelihood for the people of Kutch. The Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, constituted a committee to inspect the allegations against M/s. Adani Port and SEZ Ltd. The committee found that it was not possible to assess the damage caused to creek systems over the past 6-7 years during the construction of ports, power plants, and ancillary facilities. The court heard both parties and reserved judgment. The court denies the request to appoint an independent committee to investigate the alleged obstruction of 14 rivers by a company. The court finds that the committee constituted by the Collector, Bhuj has adequate technical expertise and that no blockage or obstruction to the natural flow of the rivers was found. The court also notes that the company has been granted environmental clearance and allotted land by the State Government. The writ petition is dismissed, and the civil applications referred to in the order are disposed of accordingly.

The court order discusses allegations of environmental damage caused by the construction and operation of the Adani Waterfront and Power Plant Project in Mundra Taluka. The court has received reports from a committee that visited the site and made recommendations for project clearance conditions and post-clearance monitoring. The respondent denies any wrongdoing and argues that the petition suffers from delay and laches. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has granted environmental clearance for the project, and it is up to them to take action based on the committee's report. A committee has been constituted by the Office of the Collector to investigate the matter further.

The court order involves various officers and departments related to irrigation and road building in the Mundra and Bhuj areas. The issues raised are technical and require time to be effectively addressed. A committee conducted a site inspection and found no obstruction to the natural flow of water in various rivers, including Kundal River, Shiracha Chhello, Dhaneshwar River, Bochavalo Chhello, Navinal Chhello, Nagmati River, and Kapuriya River. No bunding or obstruction was found in any of these rivers. The court describes the state of various rivers and their surroundings, noting the absence of bunding and obstruction in the flow of water. The petitioner argues that the government is not doing enough to protect the rivers and that the committee constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest is ineffective. The petitioner requests the appointment of an independent fact-finding commission. The court does not address this request in the given text.

The court order discusses the severe damage caused to rivers due to mining of aggregates, including pollution, changes in pH levels, and channel incision. The order emphasizes the obligation of the government to conserve natural resources and protect the environment, as per the Constitution's provisions and the Doctrine of Public Trust. The court also highlights the importance of filing proper affidavits and producing complete records by the State and other authorities in public interest litigation. The order concludes by stating that public interest litigation is not adversarial but an opportunity for the government to make basic human rights meaningful.

The court order also discusses the issue of public interest litigation (PIL) and the standing of groups of individuals to bring such cases to court. The court examines a report by a committee regarding allegations of environmental damage caused by a company, but finds that the report is not relevant to the specific issue of alleged encroachment on river beds. The court then examines a report by another committee, which found no evidence of obstruction to the natural flow of water by the company. The court rejects objections to the filing of this report and concludes that the petitioners have not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, the court order addresses multiple writ petitions related to environmental concerns in the Mundra and Kutch regions. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and balancing economic
