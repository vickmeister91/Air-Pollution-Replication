In two separate court orders, the release of confiscated vehicles has been ordered due to lack of evidence and failure to prove the owner's involvement in the crime committed using the vehicle.

In the first case, a vehicle was confiscated by forest officers for transporting illegal manganese ore. The owner of the vehicle filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to get the vehicle released. The court examined the evidence and found that the owner did not give consent to transport the illegal substance and that the driver had taken the vehicle on rent. The court ordered the release of the vehicle and criticized the forest officers for ignoring evidence and confiscating a valuable vehicle for a small amount of illegal substance.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of evidence and consent in confiscation cases. The burden of proof lies on the authorities to prove that the owner of the vehicle was involved in the crime committed using the vehicle. In this case, the court found that the owner had no knowledge or involvement in the transportation of illegal manganese ore and therefore ordered the release of the vehicle.

In the second case, the court order states that the burden of proof is on the owner of a vehicle to prove that they had no knowledge or involvement in a crime committed using their vehicle. The court refers to a previous case where it was held that if the owner did not know that their vehicle was used in a crime, then confiscation is not justified. In the present case, the applicant had rented out their vehicle to a driver who used it for a crime without their knowledge. Therefore, the order of confiscation passed by the authorized officer has no basis, and all impugned orders are set aside. The seized truck is to be released and handed over to the applicant without delay. The order is to be sent to the relevant authorities for compliance.

This case emphasizes the importance of due diligence on the part of vehicle owners when renting out their vehicles. It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that their vehicle is not being used for illegal activities. However, if the owner can prove that they had no knowledge or involvement in the crime committed using their vehicle, then confiscation is not justified.

In both cases, the court's decision to release the confiscated vehicles highlights the importance of evidence and due diligence. The burden of proof lies on the authorities to prove the owner's involvement in the crime committed using the vehicle. If the owner can prove that they had no knowledge or involvement in the crime, then confiscation is not justified. These cases serve as a reminder to authorities to ensure that they have sufficient evidence before confiscating valuable assets such as vehicles.
