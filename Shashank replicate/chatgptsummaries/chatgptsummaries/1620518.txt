The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between VST Industries Ltd and VST Industries Workers Union & Anr. The workers union had filed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus to treat the canteen workers as employees of the company and grant them monetary and other benefits. The company argued that no writ could be issued against them as they are not an authority or person against whom a writ would lie. However, the court held that when a public duty is called upon to be discharged by a private management, a writ of mandamus would lie and could be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also held that the duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party, no matter by what means the duty is imposed.

The court order discusses the principles of judicial review and when it is appropriate to use it. It states that not all decisions made by bodies performing public functions are subject to judicial review, and that contracts between parties should normally govern disputes. The case in question involves a cigarette manufacturer who is obligated to set up a canteen for their workers, but the court determines that this does not constitute a public function and therefore cannot be subject to judicial review. The court also discusses a separate case involving employees of a canteen who are deemed to be employees of the company that runs the canteen. The court upholds this decision and dismisses the appeal.

In another court order, the court confirms that the employees in question are indeed employed by the appellant. The appellant had argued that it was not possible to run a canteen in the refinery area due to hazardous areas where no fire or source of heat or light capable of igniting inflammable vapours shall be allowed. However, the court found no evidence to support this claim. The fact that a fire had taken place in the area and damaged the canteen did not affect the award made by the Tribunal. The court rejected the appellant's contentions and dismissed the appeals with no costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of public duty and positive obligation owed by private management to their employees. The court recognizes that private companies can be held accountable for their actions and can be subject to judicial review when they are performing public functions. However, the court also acknowledges that not all decisions made by private companies are subject to judicial review and that contracts between parties should normally govern disputes.

In the case of VST Industries Ltd, the court recognizes the duty of the company to provide for their workers and grants the workers union's petition for a writ of mandamus. This decision reinforces the idea that private companies have a responsibility to their employees and must be held accountable for their actions.

In the other case, the court confirms that the employees in question are indeed employed by the appellant and dismisses the appeals made by the company. This decision highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in court and reinforces the idea that private companies cannot use hazardous conditions as an excuse to avoid their responsibilities to their employees.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder that private companies have a responsibility to their employees and must be held accountable for their actions. The court recognizes the importance of public duty and positive obligation owed by private management to their employees and reinforces the idea that contracts between parties should normally govern disputes.
