The case in question involved a dispute between the appellant and the respondent over the construction of a factory for the manufacturing of cement cavity box. The appellant had filed a suit seeking a relief restraining the respondent from constructing the factory on his property. However, the trial court dismissed the suit, and the Sub Judge confirmed the decision. The appellant then filed an appeal before the Kerala High Court, questioning the judgment and decree delivered by the Sub Judge.

The appellant raised three points before the court. Firstly, he argued that the finding of the court in a previous case would operate as res judicata. Secondly, he contended that the suit was maintainable on the grounds of actionable nuisance. Finally, he argued that the court had erred in dismissing the suit.

The court held that the finding of the court in a previous case would not operate as res judicata. The court noted that the previous case had involved a different set of facts and circumstances. Therefore, the finding of the court in the previous case could not be applied to the present case.

The court also held that the suit was maintainable on the grounds of actionable nuisance. The court noted that the construction of the factory would cause a nuisance to the appellant. Therefore, the appellant had a right to seek relief from the court.

However, the court dismissed the appeal, stating that the appellant could bring another action and seek an appropriate relief on proof of cause of action having accrued. The court noted that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that he had suffered any damage as a result of the construction of the factory. Therefore, the court could not grant him any relief.

The court held that the finding of the court in a previous case would not operate as res judicata. The court also held that the suit was maintainable on the grounds of actionable nuisance.
