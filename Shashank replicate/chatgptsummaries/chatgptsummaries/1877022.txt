The case in question involves a mortgage bond against Shah Abdul Ghani of Sasaram, which the respondents were about to execute when a suit was filed by the wife and mother of Abdul Ghani. They claimed that the mortgaged property was wakf property and could not be sold in execution of a decree. The plaintiffs prayed for an injunction staying further proceedings in execution, which was refused by the Subordinate Judge. The plaintiffs appealed to the High Court and obtained an interim stay of execution proceedings, but the decree-holders were later permitted to proceed with the execution on their depositing four hundred rupees as security against a possible loss to be suffered by the plaintiffs.

The Subordinate Judge ultimately dismissed the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs could have applied for an injunction or recovery of possession but failed to do so, and the suit was barred by the provisions of Section 42, Specific Relief Act. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing that they should not be required to pray for recovery of possession as their possession had not been disturbed at the time of filing the suit.

The court held that the suit was rightly dismissed as barred by Section 42, but the plaintiffs may be given an opportunity to amend their plaint and pay ad valorem court-fee on the valuation of the property of which recovery is sought within three months.
