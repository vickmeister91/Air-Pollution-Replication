The Shekinah Blessing Centre, a registered trust, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Tahsildar, and Inspector of Police in Thiruppur District. The petitioner, a pastor practicing Christianity, sought to conduct prayer meetings, tuition classes, and joint prayers at his residence after obtaining plan approval from the District Municipality. However, the court ordered an inspection of the premises to determine if the petitioner had complied with Rule 6(4) of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Building Rules, 1972, which requires prior approval from the Collector of the District for the construction of a building intended for public worship or religious purposes.

The court order requires the First Respondent to inspect the Petitioner's premises to determine if it is being used for public worship or religious purposes that require approval. The Petitioner's application for permission to conduct public worship has been rejected due to causing inconvenience in the neighborhood and construction without prior approval. The court cites the Church of God (Full Gospel) case and states that while freedom of religion is a fundamental right, it is subject to public order, morality, and health. The court emphasizes the need to enforce rules for the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers to control noise pollution.

The court order states that while conducting public worship in residential premises, the petitioner must ensure that no hindrance or disturbance is caused to the general public. The concerned authorities have the right to take necessary action under relevant statutes in case of any nuisance being caused due to noise pollution or violation of statutory provisions. The conduct of public worship causing disturbance to the neighborhood cannot be permitted, especially when it is found that it would not be possible to grant permission under the relevant rules.

The writ petition filed by the Shekinah Blessing Centre was dismissed, and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed. The court order emphasizes the importance of complying with the relevant rules and regulations while conducting public worship or religious activities. The court also highlights the need to ensure that such activities do not cause any disturbance or inconvenience to the general public.

The court's decision is in line with the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of religion to all citizens. However, this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions that are necessary for public order, morality, and health. The court's order emphasizes the need to balance the right to freedom of religion with the rights of the general public to live in peace and harmony.

The court's order also highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the relevant authorities before constructing a building intended for public worship or religious purposes. This is in line with the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Building Rules, 1972, which require such approval to ensure that the construction is safe and does not cause any inconvenience or disturbance to the neighborhood.

In conclusion, the court's order in the Shekinah Blessing Centre case emphasizes the need to balance the right to freedom of religion with the rights of the general public to live in peace and harmony. The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with the relevant rules and regulations while conducting public worship or religious activities. It also emphasizes the need to obtain prior approval from the relevant authorities before constructing a building intended for public worship or religious purposes.
