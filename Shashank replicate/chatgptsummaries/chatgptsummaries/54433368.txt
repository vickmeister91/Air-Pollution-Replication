In June 2015, the Kerala High Court delivered a judgment on a writ petition filed by Green Cross World Environment Protection Action Group against the killing of a tiger by forest officials in Wayanad, Kerala. The petition sought a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the killing and identify the officials responsible. It also sought guidelines to protect tigers and prevent their killing in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks in Kerala.

The court heard the case on 3 June 2015 and delivered its judgment on 12 June 2015. The court order describes the events leading up to the killing of a tiger in Wayanad. The District Magistrate and Collector reported several incidents of the tiger attacking humans and property, leading to an order to hunt the tiger by tranquilizing or using cages. Despite efforts to capture the tiger, it was ultimately shot and killed by a forest official. The petitioners argued that the killing was unjustified and that the tiger should have been captured and relocated.

The court considered the events leading up to the killing and the actions taken by forest officials, ultimately concluding that there was no need for further investigation by the CBI. The court order also provides guidelines for dealing with wild tigers in order to prevent fatalities and tragedies. It emphasizes the importance of involving police and local administration in controlling mobs and coordinating with district level officials to alert nearby villages.

The order outlines procedures for trapping and immobilizing tigers, and specifies that healthy tigers should not be eliminated unless they habitually cause human death. The Chief Wildlife Warden has the final decision on whether a tiger should be released back into the wild or transferred to a zoo. The order directs officials to follow these guidelines to ensure the conservation of national animals and prevent incidents like the one that occurred on December 2, 2012.

In another court order, the court rejected a petitioner's request for a CBI enquiry into an incident where a tiger entered a human settlement causing panic among the locals. The forest department attempted to tranquilize the animal but failed, and the tiger became a threat to human life. A forest official shot and killed the tiger to protect himself and others. An enquiry was conducted, and the official was given a punishment of censure. The court directed the authorities to follow the standard operating procedure to deal with such situations in the future. The procedure includes setting up a committee for technical guidance, identifying the animal, collecting data, setting traps, involving district authorities, and maintaining law and order.
