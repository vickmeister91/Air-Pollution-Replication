In a writ petition filed by the Environment Support Group and Mr. Leo F. Saldanha against the National Biodiversity Authority, the petitioners sought to declare Section 40 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 illegal and unconstitutional and to quash a notification issued by the authority. The petitioners contended that the notification issued by the authority was in violation of the provisions of the Act and that the authority had exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the notification.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, ordered the petition to be transferred to the National Green Tribunal for further adjudication and orders. The court held that the tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide all substantial questions relating to enforcement of any legal right arising out of implementation of the Act. The court further held that the tribunal is better equipped to deal with the technical and scientific aspects of the case.

The court disposed of the petition without entering into the merits of the other contentions of the parties. The court held that the transfer of the petition to the tribunal would not prejudice the rights of the parties and that the tribunal would be able to decide the matter expeditiously.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to conserve the biological diversity of the country and to regulate access to biological resources. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Biodiversity Authority, which is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Act.

Section 40 of the Act deals with the power of the National Biodiversity Authority to issue guidelines and directions for the implementation of the Act. The petitioners contended that the notification issued by the authority was in violation of the provisions of the Act and that the authority had exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the notification.

The National Green Tribunal is a specialized tribunal that deals with environmental disputes and is empowered to hear cases relating to the implementation of environmental laws. The tribunal has the power to issue orders and directions for the protection and conservation of the environment.

The transfer of the petition to the National Green Tribunal is a positive development as it will ensure that the matter is heard by a specialized tribunal that is better equipped to deal with the technical and scientific aspects of the case. The tribunal will be able to provide an expert opinion on the legality and constitutionality of Section 40 of the Act and the notification issued by the National Biodiversity Authority.

In conclusion, the court's decision to transfer the petition to the National Green Tribunal is a welcome development as it will ensure that the matter is heard by a specialized tribunal that is better equipped to deal with the technical and scientific aspects of the case. The tribunal will be able to provide an expert opinion on the legality and constitutionality of Section 40 of the Act and the notification issued by the National Biodiversity Authority. The decision will also ensure that the matter is decided expeditiously and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
