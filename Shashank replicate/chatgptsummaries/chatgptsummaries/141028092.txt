The court order pertains to a petition filed by Umesh Sharma challenging the imposition of restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and other sound instruments after 10:00 PM during the Navratri Festival. Sharma argued that the restrictions were not applicable under the Madhya Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1985, and cited a judgment delivered in the case of In Re: Noise Pollution - Implementation of the Laws for Restricting Use of Loudspeakers and High Volume Producing Sound Systems With Forum, Prevention of Envn. & Sound Pollution Vs. Union of India & Another reported in AIR 2005 SC 3136. The court examined the need to create general awareness towards the hazardous effect of noise pollution and directed the state to take measures to prevent noise pollution during festivals and celebrations.

The court order outlines guidelines for controlling noise pollution, including regulations for firecrackers, loudspeakers, and vehicular noise. Manufacturers of firecrackers must list their chemical contents and comply with regulations, and firecrackers for export must meet noise standards and have different packaging. The use of loudspeakers is restricted to certain noise levels and times, and no horns are allowed to be used at night in residential areas except in emergencies. The order also emphasizes the need for awareness and education about the harmful effects of noise pollution and encourages the involvement of resident welfare associations and service clubs in preventing it. The order was issued under the power of the Constitution of India and will remain in force until modified by the court or superseded by legislation. The State and Central Governments are responsible for enforcing the regulations and laying down standards. The court also ruled that the District Magistrate is not authorized to grant exemptions to the regulations.

The court order states that no exemption can be granted to silence zone areas for the use of loudspeakers or public address systems during cultural or religious festivals. The exemption is limited to 15 days in a calendar year, as specified by the Central Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. The court declares that Section 13 of the Adhiniyam of 1985, which refers to 29 days in a calendar year for social and religious festivals, is ultra vires and cannot be saved. The Competent Authority/District Magistrate is obligated to enforce the law and ensure that the use of loudspeakers and holding of Garba during festivals is subject to restrictions as provided under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 and Madhya Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1985. The petitioner can approach the State Government for appropriate orders. The writ petition is disposed of.
