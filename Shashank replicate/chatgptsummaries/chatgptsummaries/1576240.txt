The Indian government introduced a scheme for High Security Number Plates for vehicles in 2001. However, despite several orders and directions from the court, many states in India have failed to implement the scheme. The court has classified the states into different categories based on their compliance with the scheme and has issued notices to show cause why proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act should not be initiated against the concerned officers of the defaulting states.

The court order requires the Secretary of Transport and Commissioner of State Transport Authority of defaulting states to show cause why proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 should not be initiated against them for intentional violation of the court's order. The State of Haryana is one such state that has hardly taken any steps to implement the scheme, and the court finds their conduct to be callous and lacking in will and sincerity.

The court examines certain principles of law that guide the exercise of judicial discretion in the realm of contempt jurisdiction. The law relating to contempt is primarily dissected into two main heads of jurisdiction under the Indian Law: Criminal Contempt and Civil Contempt. The conduct of the parties, the act of disobedience, and the attendant circumstances are relevant to consider whether a case would fall under civil contempt or criminal contempt.

The court order explains that when a party disobeys the orders of the court, it may be treated as civil or criminal contempt depending on the conduct of the parties. The court's primary concern is intentional and willful violation of its orders. Every person is required to respect and obey the orders of the court with due dignity for the institution. The government departments are no exception to it. The court also notes that disobedience of court orders by positive or active contribution or non-obedience by a passive and dormant conduct leads to the same result. Disobedience of orders of the court strikes at the very root of the rule of law on which the judicial system rests. The court also emphasizes that inordinate delay in complying with the orders of the courts has received judicial criticism.

The court order states that the failure of government officials to comply with court orders is considered disobedience and contempt of court. The State of Haryana has failed to comply with court orders for years, causing prejudice to the public and undermining the dignity of the court. The officers in charge are guilty of wilful disobedience and are punished with fines and imprisonment. The State of Haryana is also ordered to pay exemplary costs and implement the scheme within eight weeks. The court emphasizes the importance of compliance with court orders and the rule of law.
