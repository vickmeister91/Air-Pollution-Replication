The court order pertains to a case of eviction filed by Shri R.N. Gupta against Shri K.L. Sharma and M/s. Tara Enterprises. Gupta alleged that Sharma had sublet the premises to someone without his written consent and was using it for a purpose other than what it was let out for. The trial court dismissed the petition, and Gupta appealed the decision. The court found that there was no evidence to prove that Sharma had lost his physical or legal possession over the premises and dismissed the appeal.

The court order states that there is no evidence to prove that the tenant has lost physical or legal possession of the premises. The court cites previous cases where even though the father had retired from the business and the sons had been looking after the business, it cannot be said that the father had divested himself of the legal right to be in possession. The court also cites a case where a bank cannot be held liable for eviction under Section 13(1)(a) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, as the bank retained its power to call upon the Trade Union to vacate premises at any time. The court concludes that there is no infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned Additional Rent Controller, and therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

In this case, Shri R.N. Gupta filed a petition for eviction against Shri K.L. Sharma and M/s. Tara Enterprises, alleging that Sharma had sublet the premises to someone without his written consent and was using it for a purpose other than what it was let out for. The trial court dismissed the petition, and Gupta appealed the decision. However, the court found that there was no evidence to prove that Sharma had lost his physical or legal possession over the premises and dismissed the appeal.

The court cited previous cases to support its decision. In one case, even though the father had retired from the business and the sons had been looking after the business, it was held that the father had not divested himself of the legal right to be in possession. In another case, a bank was not held liable for eviction under Section 13(1)(a) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, as the bank retained its power to call upon the Trade Union to vacate premises at any time.

Based on these precedents, the court concluded that there was no infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned Additional Rent Controller, and therefore, the appeal was dismissed. The court order emphasizes the importance of having evidence to prove that a tenant has lost physical or legal possession of the premises before filing a petition for eviction.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to landlords and tenants alike to be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities when it comes to renting and leasing property. It also highlights the importance of having proper documentation and evidence to support any claims made in court.
