In a recent court order, a repeat bail application filed by Dharmendra Singh was rejected under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with Forest Crime No. 9876/2007 for the offences punishable under Sections 27, 29, 50, 51, 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41 & 52 of Indian Forest Act. The applicant had been arrested on the FIR lodged one year ago and has been in custody since 23.10.2018. The court rejected the bail application as no new ground was made out for grant of bail.

The case pertains to the violation of various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. The accused, Dharmendra Singh, had been arrested on the basis of an FIR lodged against him one year ago. Since then, he had been in custody and had filed a repeat bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. However, the court rejected the application as no new ground was made out for grant of bail.

The Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act are two important pieces of legislation that aim to protect the wildlife and forests of India. These acts provide for the conservation of wildlife and forests, and also regulate activities that may have an impact on them. The sections under which Dharmendra Singh was charged are particularly important as they deal with offences such as hunting, poaching, and destruction of wildlife and forests.

The court's decision to reject the bail application is significant as it sends a strong message that violations of the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act will not be taken lightly. The court's decision also highlights the importance of protecting India's wildlife and forests, which are an integral part of the country's natural heritage.

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on the fact that no new ground was made out for grant of bail. This means that the accused failed to provide any new evidence or arguments that would have convinced the court to grant him bail. The court's decision was therefore based on the merits of the case and the evidence presented before it.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the repeat bail application filed by Dharmendra Singh under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with Forest Crime No. 9876/2007 for the offences punishable under Sections 27, 29, 50, 51, 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and Sections 41 & 52 of Indian Forest Act is a significant one. The decision sends a strong message that violations of the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act will not be taken lightly and highlights the importance of protecting India's wildlife and forests. The decision was based on the merits of the case and the evidence presented before the court, and no new ground was made out for grant of bail.
