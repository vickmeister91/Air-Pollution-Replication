The court order in question was issued in response to a writ petition filed by P.D. Baby against the District Collector and other respondents. The petitioner had sought the quashing of Exhibit P9 and a writ of mandamus to remove the obstruction caused in the road leading to the quarrying site of the petitioner. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately ruled that a forest road cannot be used for commercial purposes such as transporting rocks from a granite quarry without express permission from the Central Government.

The court found that the objections raised in Exhibit P9 were no longer relevant since the petitioner was no longer using the property for quarrying operations. The writ petition was ordered accordingly. The court's decision was based on the fact that the use of forest roads for commercial purposes is prohibited under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court held that the petitioner had no right to use the forest road for transporting rocks from the quarry without obtaining the necessary permission from the Central Government.

The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to show that he had obtained the necessary permission from the Central Government. The court observed that the petitioner had been using the forest road for commercial purposes for a long time without any authorization from the Central Government. The court held that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and was liable to be punished for the same.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary environmental clearances for the quarrying operations. The court held that the petitioner had violated the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, and was liable to be punished for the same. The court directed the petitioner to obtain the necessary environmental clearances before resuming the quarrying operations.

The court also noted that the petitioner had caused damage to the forest area by carrying out the quarrying operations without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. The court held that the petitioner was liable to pay compensation for the damage caused to the forest area. The court directed the petitioner to pay the compensation within a period of six months.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by P.D. Baby against the District Collector and other respondents. The court ruled that a forest road cannot be used for commercial purposes such as transporting rocks from a granite quarry without express permission from the Central Government. The court found that the objections raised in Exhibit P9 were no longer relevant since the petitioner was no longer using the property for quarrying operations. The court directed the petitioner to obtain the necessary environmental clearances before resuming the quarrying operations and to pay compensation for the damage caused to the forest area.
