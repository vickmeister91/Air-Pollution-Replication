The case in question involves a petition filed by Gopal, seeking the quashing of FIR No.72/07 registered against him for the offence of Section 91 (6) of the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act. Gopal argued that he was in lawful possession of the land in question and that the procedure for registering an FIR was not followed. The Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, argued that notice was given to the petitioner and that the genuineness of the "Patta" was under dispute.

The court heard both sides and ultimately rejected the petition, stating that no material existed for quashing the FIR. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim of lawful possession of the land. Additionally, the court noted that the procedure for registering an FIR had been followed and that notice had been given to the petitioner.

The court also considered the issue of the genuineness of the "Patta" and noted that this was a matter that would need to be determined through a proper investigation. The court stated that it was not within its jurisdiction to determine the genuineness of the document and that this would need to be determined through the appropriate legal channels.

Overall, the court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the evidence presented by both sides. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim of lawful possession of the land and that the procedure for registering an FIR had been followed. The court also recognized that the issue of the genuineness of the "Patta" was a matter that would need to be determined through a proper investigation.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support one's claims in legal proceedings. It also underscores the need for proper investigation and legal channels to determine the validity of important documents such as land ownership documents. Ultimately, the court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures in all matters related to land ownership and other legal disputes.
