The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Davanagere, in a sessions case where the accused were alleged to have committed offenses punishable under Section 302 read with 201 of the Indian Penal Code.

The prosecution had filed an application seeking permission to display a video cassette or compact disc recording the sequence of the accused showing the place of occurrence and the dead body to the police and to recall two witnesses.

The court rejected the petition, stating that it was not prohibited to produce material evidence essential to arrive at a proper decision and that the petitioner could test the same in cross-examination of the concerned witnesses.
