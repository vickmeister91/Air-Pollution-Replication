The recent court order concerns the validity of recommendations made by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) regarding the implementation of a notification issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The notification sought to preserve the Kolleru Lake, a wetland ecosystem of international importance, by prohibiting the construction of fish tanks and other encroachments. The court found that the final notification issued under section 26A of the Act determined the rights of the parties, including the right of local fishermen to do fishing by traditional methods, but prohibited aquaculture in the form of any tank.

The Kolleru Lake is a significant wetland ecosystem that is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. The lake is also an important source of livelihood for the local communities, who depend on it for fishing and agriculture. However, over the years, the lake has been facing severe threats due to encroachments and unsustainable practices such as aquaculture and pisciculture. To address these issues, the State of Andhra Pradesh issued a notification under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, to preserve the lake and regulate activities such as aquaculture, pisciculture, prawn culture, and shrimp culture.

The court order upholds the notification issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh and prohibits aquaculture in the form of any tank. The court also directs the removal of any encroachment activities that are not permitted. Traditional fishing methods are still allowed, but the formation of fish tanks for aquaculture or any other purpose is prohibited. The notification regulates activities such as aquaculture, pisciculture, prawn culture, and shrimp culture to preserve the identity of the lake. The government has balanced the needs of sustainable development with the livelihood of persons surviving on the resources of the lake.

The court order also upholds the recommendations made by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) for the demolition of all fish tanks constructed inside the Kolleru Wild Life Sanctuary and the prohibition of the use or transportation of inputs for pisciculture in the sanctuary. The CEC had conducted a detailed study of the lake and had recommended measures to preserve its ecological balance. The court has directed the State government to implement the directions of the CEC to stop the use or transportation of inputs for pisciculture and to demolish all fish tanks in a time-bound manner.

The court order is a significant step towards the conservation of the Kolleru Lake and its ecosystem. The order recognizes the importance of preserving the lake and regulating activities that may harm its ecological balance. The order also acknowledges the rights of the local communities who depend on the lake for their livelihood and allows them to continue traditional fishing methods. The order strikes a balance between conservation and sustainable development and sets a precedent for the protection of other wetland ecosystems in the country.

In conclusion, the recent court order upholds the notification issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh to preserve the Kolleru Lake and regulates activities such as aquaculture, pisciculture, prawn culture, and shrimp culture. The order prohibits aquaculture in the form of any tank and directs the removal of any encroachment activities that are not permitted. Traditional fishing methods are still allowed, but the formation of fish tanks for aquaculture or any other purpose is prohibited. The order also upholds the recommendations made by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) for the demolition of all fish tanks constructed inside the Kolleru Wild Life Sanctuary and the prohibition of the use or transportation of inputs for pisciculture in the sanctuary. The court order is a significant step towards the conservation of the Kolleru Lake and its ecosystem and sets a precedent for the protection of other wetland ecosystems in the country.
