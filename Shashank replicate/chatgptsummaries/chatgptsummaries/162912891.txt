The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed a court order in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Medha Patkar against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The PIL raised two main issues: firstly, whether the State Government and its authorities can grant mining lease in an area that is already vested in the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA); and secondly, the environmental issues arising out of carrying out mining activities, particularly of sand in the submerged area.

The court found that the State authorities cannot issue mining lease or permission with respect to land once the title and authority of the land is given to the NVDA. The court held that once the land is vested in the NVDA, the State Government and its authorities cannot grant mining lease or permission with respect to such land. The court observed that the NVDA is a statutory body created under the Narmada Valley Development Authority Act, 1984, and is responsible for the development of the Narmada Valley. The court held that the NVDA has the exclusive right to use the land for the purpose of development and that the State Government and its authorities cannot grant mining lease or permission with respect to such land.

The court also dealt with the issue of environmental concerns arising out of mining activities, particularly of sand in the submerged area. The court held that this issue is subject to the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) constituted under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court directed the Registry to prepare three photocopies of the entire set of documents and forward the same to the Registrar of NGT, Bhopal, with a request to him to place the matter along with a copy of this order before the Hon'ble Bench for proceeding in the matter in accordance with law. The parties may appear before the NGT, Bhopal, for proceeding in the matter in accordance with law.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the rights of the NVDA and the State Government and its authorities with respect to mining lease and permission. The court has held that once the land is vested in the NVDA, the State Government and its authorities cannot grant mining lease or permission with respect to such land. This will help in protecting the interests of the NVDA and ensuring that the land is used for the purpose of development.

The court has also directed the matter of environmental concerns arising out of mining activities to the NGT. This is significant as the NGT is a specialized body that deals with environmental issues and has the expertise to deal with such matters. The NGT will be able to ensure that the mining activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner and that the interests of the local communities are protected.

The court order is a positive step towards ensuring sustainable development in the Narmada Valley. The NVDA has been entrusted with the responsibility of developing the Narmada Valley and ensuring that the interests of the local communities are protected. The court order will help in ensuring that the NVDA is able to carry out its responsibilities without any interference from the State Government and its authorities.

The court has also recognized the importance of environmental concerns and has directed the matter to the NGT. This will help in ensuring that the mining activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner and that the interests of the local communities are protected.

In conclusion, the court order is a positive step towards ensuring sustainable development in the Narmada Valley. The court has clarified the rights of the NVDA and the State Government and its authorities with respect to mining lease and permission. The court has also recognized the importance of environmental concerns and has directed the matter to the NGT. The court order will help in ensuring that the NVDA is able to carry out its responsibilities without any interference from the State Government and its authorities and that the mining activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner.
