The court order in question pertains to three revision petitions filed by three individuals seeking to set aside an order on charge and framing of charges against them under sections 67/68 of the Delhi Metro Railway (Operation & Maintenance) Act, 2002. The charges were based on allegations that the individuals forcibly entered the cabin of a train at Green Park Metro Station, obstructed train movement, misbehaved with officials, and manhandled the train operator. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the charges against the individuals.

The court order states that the absence of a recorded presence of one of the accused is not significant at this stage, as the court is only required to consider a prima facie case. The prosecution's allegations are supported by the record, while the defense's arguments are not fully supported. The court cites previous cases to establish that if there is a strong suspicion of the accused's involvement in the crime, the court is justified in framing charges and proceeding with the trial. The accused in this case are liable to be charged under sections 67/68 of DMOM Act for obstructing the running of a train.

The court found prima facie evidence connecting the accused to the alleged offense and dismissed their revision petition, stating that discharge was not the only remedy. The court also ordered an attested copy of the judgment to be placed in the other related criminal revision petitions and for the trail court record to be returned.
