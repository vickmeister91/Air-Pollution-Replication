In a recent court order, the Madras High Court has allowed the production of medical records of a man from a mental health facility in a case filed by his wife under the Domestic Violence Act. The case was filed by Shanthi Christy Bai against her husband Gnana Raja and his relatives. Bai had filed a petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to summon medical records of Raja from a mental health facility to prove his addiction to alcohol.

Raja had challenged this petition, arguing that the medical records were confidential and could not be produced in court. However, the court dismissed his petition and allowed the medical records to be produced in court. The court also directed that photocopies of the records be furnished to Raja for effective cross-examination.

The case highlights the importance of medical records in cases of domestic violence. In many cases, victims of domestic violence may not have physical evidence to prove their claims. Medical records can provide crucial evidence of abuse, addiction, and other factors that may contribute to the abuse.

The court's decision to allow the production of medical records in this case is a positive step towards ensuring justice for victims of domestic violence. It sends a strong message that medical records can be used as evidence in court and that confidentiality cannot be used as a shield to protect abusers.

However, it is important to note that the use of medical records in court must be done carefully and with sensitivity. Medical records contain sensitive information about a person's health and should not be used to shame or stigmatize them. The court must ensure that the use of medical records is necessary and proportionate to the case at hand.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision to allow the production of medical records in a case of domestic violence is a positive step towards ensuring justice for victims. It highlights the importance of medical records in cases of domestic violence and sends a strong message that confidentiality cannot be used as a shield to protect abusers. However, the use of medical records in court must be done carefully and with sensitivity to ensure that the rights and dignity of all parties involved are respected.
