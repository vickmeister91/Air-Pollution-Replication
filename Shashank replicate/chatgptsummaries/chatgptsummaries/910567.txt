The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case in which the Gujarat Pollution Control Board challenged the acquittal of Kashiram Textile Mills Ltd and its directors for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The complainant alleged that the accused did not comply with provisions of the Act and rules made thereunder. However, the Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of a notification declaring the area to be an air pollution control area, which was necessary for the Act to be applicable. As a result, the Court upheld the acquittal.

The court order highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the rules made thereunder. The Act was enacted to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. It is applicable to all persons and industries that emit pollutants into the air. The Act empowers the Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution.

In this case, the prosecution alleged that Kashiram Textile Mills Ltd and its directors violated the provisions of the Act by emitting pollutants into the air without complying with the prescribed norms. The prosecution argued that the accused did not have the necessary permissions and approvals to operate the textile mills and that they did not take adequate measures to control air pollution.

However, the Court found that the prosecution failed to produce and prove the notification and norms related to the alleged breach. The court order states that emissions standards should be prescribed based on the local and physical requirements of the area. The prosecution did not provide any evidence to show that the emissions standards prescribed for the area were violated by the accused. The court found that the prosecution did not have a strong case and there was an apparent discrepancy in the dates.

The court order highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. It is essential for industries to obtain the necessary permissions and approvals before commencing operations. Industries must also take adequate measures to control air pollution and comply with the prescribed emissions standards.

The court order also emphasizes the need for the prosecution to produce strong evidence to prove the alleged breach. The prosecution must provide evidence to show that the accused violated the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. The prosecution must also produce and prove the notification and norms related to the alleged breach.

In conclusion, the court order upholding the acquittal of Kashiram Textile Mills Ltd and its directors highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the rules made thereunder. It is essential for industries to obtain the necessary permissions and approvals before commencing operations and take adequate measures to control air pollution. The prosecution must provide strong evidence to prove the alleged breach and produce and prove the notification and norms related to the alleged breach.
