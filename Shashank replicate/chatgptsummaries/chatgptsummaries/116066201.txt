The court order discussed in this summary pertains to a writ petition filed by Y. Akbar Ahmed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to consider his representation regarding the fixation of common rates for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items in grade hotels such as Grade 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 star hotels, restaurants, etc. The court informed the petitioner that public interest writ petition is an extraordinary remedy to be invoked and costs would be imposed if there is no public interest in the petition. The court also explained the concept of Public Interest Litigation and cited decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on public interest writ petition.

The court order emphasizes the need for caution when entertaining public interest litigations, as they can encroach upon the sphere reserved for the Executive and Legislature. The court must act ruthlessly when dealing with imposters and busybodies who masquerade as crusaders of justice. The court should filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique motives. The court should strike a balance between avoiding public mischief and avoiding mischievous petitions seeking to assail justifiable executive actions. The court should be extremely careful not to allow its process to be abused by politicians and others to delay legitimate administrative action or to gain a political objective.

The court order criticizes the increasing number of frivolous Public Interest Litigations (PILs) being filed in courts, which waste valuable judicial time that could be used for genuine cases. The court emphasizes that PILs should only be used for genuine public interest cases and not for personal gain or ulterior motives. The court also suggests that High Courts should dismiss such frivolous petitions and impose exemplary costs to discourage such behavior. The court order also highlights the need for courts to filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to send a message that petitions filed with oblique motives do not have the approval of the courts. The court also emphasizes that PILs should be used with great care and circumspection and not as a tool for personal gain or publicity. The court also cites various judgments of the Supreme Court and High Courts to regulate PILs and lays down rules to regulate PILs filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court order also discusses the conditions under which a writ of mandamus can be issued. It states that there must be a legal right to enforce the performance of a duty, and that the duty must be of a public nature created by the Constitution, statute, or common law. The petitioner must establish their legal right and show that the authority has failed to perform a legal or statutory duty. The court rejects the prayer sought for and dismisses the writ petition, but refrains from imposing costs with the hope that the petitioner will only invoke the court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for genuine public interest causes.

In summary, the court order emphasizes the need for caution when entertaining public interest litigations and the importance of using PILs only for genuine public interest cases and not for personal gain or ulterior motives. The court also lays down rules to regulate PILs filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and highlights the conditions under which a writ of mandamus can be issued. The court rejects the prayer sought for and dismisses the writ petition, but refrains from imposing costs with the hope that the petitioner will only invoke the court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for genuine public interest causes.
