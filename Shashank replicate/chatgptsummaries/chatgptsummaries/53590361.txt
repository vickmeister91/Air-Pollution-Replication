The court also holds that enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities are strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those affected by accidents caused by such activities. The court orders the opposite parties to pay compensation without proof of negligence on their part and directs them to pay a specific amount as compensation with interest.
