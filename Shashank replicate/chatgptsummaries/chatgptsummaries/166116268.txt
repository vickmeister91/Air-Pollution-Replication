The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Shree Consultants, a company involved in environmental consultancy and biomedical waste treatment and disposal. The company had established a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (CBWTF) in Mysore, which was authorized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to operate in four districts. However, the KSPCB later excluded one district without providing the company with an opportunity to be heard. The tribunal found that the KSPCB's actions were contrary to the Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, and regulations thereunder. The tribunal also noted that the CBWTF had the capacity to treat and dispose of the biomedical waste of 12,000 to 15,000 beds, but was only receiving waste from around 5,000 beds.

The court order discusses the establishment of a second CBWTF in Mysore and the actions of the KSPCB in recommending it. The appellant's CBWTF is currently running under capacity, and there have been no complaints against it. The court finds that the recommendation for a second CBWTF was made for extraneous considerations and that there is no need for it. The appellant has disputed the feasibility report submitted by the fifth respondent and has approached the CPCB regarding the proposal. The court directs the respondent authorities to examine the complainant of the appellant in the light of the provisions of the Bio-medical Waste (Maintenance and Handling) Rules, 1998 as amended and the guidelines and to submit the report.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the establishment of a new common bio-medical waste treatment facility (CBWTF) in Mysore. The appellant, who operates the only CBWTF in the area, filed appeals against the issuance of a consent order to the 5th respondent to establish a new CBWTF. The court directed the respondent authorities to examine the complainant's concerns in light of the Bio-medical Waste (Maintenance and Handling) Rules, 1998, and guidelines, and submit a report. The appellant argued that the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) were not followed, and the new CBWTF would be too close to their facility. The respondents argued that the appellant was abusing their position and that there was a need for an alternative arrangement for disposing of bio-medical waste in the area. The court dismissed the appeals, stating that the guidelines were binding on the State Pollution Control Board and that the issuance of the consent order followed due process of law.

The court order discusses the authorization and consent given to the appellant to operate a facility and collect bio-medical waste from certain districts in Karnataka. The order also mentions the establishment of a common treatment facility by the 5th respondent and the appellant's objections to it. The court notes several shortfalls in the appellant's operations, including operational and transportation shortfalls, complaints from healthcare establishments, and improper disposal of waste. The court also mentions the appellant's failure to submit monthly reports and unreliable data. The court dismisses the appellant's objections and notes that there is no legal basis for the appellant's claims.

The court order requires the respondent/KSPCB to take action on an application for issuing consent for establishment. The appellant's case is based on fiction and there were complaints regarding non-collection of bio-medical waste. The consent for establishment for the CBWTF was issued in accordance with sections 25 and 21 of the Water and Air Acts. The court dismisses the appeals filed by the appellant and confirms the impugned order passed by the 2nd respondent. The guidelines do not impose any prohibition or restriction on the setting up of a new CBWTF. The construction sought by the appellant would create an impermissible monopoly in favor of the applicant. The KSPCB has notified that the authorization and consents issued by the KSPCB so far are hereby amended without service area mentioned therein for all the common bio-medical waste treatment facilities in Karnataka.

The court order states that the appellant's contention against the establishment of a new Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) in Karnataka is without reference to the KSPCB notification and seeking relief that would violate laws and lead to inefficiencies. The court also dismisses the appellant's interpretation of creating a monopoly right and alleges that the appellant is seeking to abuse the process of law. The court upholds the KSPCB's decision to issue consent to establish a CBWTF to the respondent No. 5 and dismisses the appeals of the appellant. The court also addresses the coverage area of the CBWTF and the need for more facilities to improve efficiency and better service in waste disposal.

The court order discusses the establishment of a plant for collecting and disposing of bio-medical waste in Mysore. The appellant had been collecting waste from four districts without any issues until the consent order was restricted to only three districts. The appellant's plant had the capacity to treat and dispose of waste from 12,000 to 15,000 beds, but was only receiving waste from around 5000 beds. The court also discusses the establishment of a second plant in Mysore, which was granted consent despite the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) stating that only one plant should be allowed in a radius of 150 km. The court finds that the consent granted to the
