The case in question involves a criminal original petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner sought to call for the records relating to an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate No.2/Fast Track Court, Madurai in Cr.M.P.No.5164 of 2016 in S.T.C.No.24 of 2016 dated 22.12.2016 and set aside the same. The petitioner also sought direction to the complainant to produce a document dated 05.12.2011, in the case filed by the respondent for the offences under Section 138 and 142 of Negotiable Instrument Act.

However, the court dismissed the petition as the document sought by the petitioner was not necessary for the trial. This decision was made after careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case.

The petitioner's argument was that the document in question was crucial to the case and would help in establishing the truth. However, the court found that the document was not necessary for the trial and that the petitioner's request was merely an attempt to delay the proceedings.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the document in question was not directly related to the charges against the respondent. The charges against the respondent were for offences under Section 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, and the document sought by the petitioner was not directly related to these charges.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the document was necessary for the trial. The court found that the petitioner's request was merely an attempt to delay the proceedings and that it was not in the interest of justice to grant the request.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petitioner's criminal original petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to call for the records relating to the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate No.2/Fast Track Court, Madurai in Cr.M.P.No.5164 of 2016 in S.T.C.No.24 of 2016 dated 22.12.2016 and set aside the same.
