A criminal petition filed by A.D. Subramanya against Smt. Savithramma and her legal representatives was recently addressed by the court. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Sagar, which had rejected applications filed by the accused under Sections 311 and 91 of CR.P.C. The petitioner had sought direction to P.W.1 to produce the passbooks mentioned in the application and money lenders' license of Savithramma. The legal representatives of Savithramma had filed objections to the application, stating that Savithramma had not obtained any money lending license and that all passbooks were surrendered to the bank after her death.

The court found that the orders did not call for any interference and dismissed the petition. This means that the original order passed by the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Sagar, stands and the applications filed by the accused under Sections 311 and 91 of CR.P.C. remain rejected.

It is important to understand the significance of Sections 311 and 91 of CR.P.C. Section 311 allows the court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, even if they have not been summoned as a witness or if they have been summoned but not examined. This section is often used to fill gaps in evidence or to clarify certain points. Section 91, on the other hand, allows the court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This section is often used to obtain important documents or evidence that may be crucial to the case.

In this case, the petitioner had sought direction to P.W.1 to produce the passbooks mentioned in the application and money lenders' license of Savithramma. The legal representatives of Savithramma had filed objections to the application, stating that Savithramma had not obtained any money lending license and that all passbooks were surrendered to the bank after her death. The court found that the orders rejecting the applications did not call for any interference, which means that the court did not find any merit in the petitioner's arguments.

It is important to note that the court's decision was based on the specific facts and circumstances of this case. The court found that the legal representatives of Savithramma had provided a valid explanation for not producing the passbooks and money lenders' license. It is possible that in other cases, the court may have come to a different conclusion based on the evidence presented.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of understanding the various sections of CR.P.C. and how they can be used to obtain important evidence or documents in a criminal case. It also emphasizes the need for parties to provide valid explanations for not producing certain documents or evidence when requested by the court. Ultimately, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that each case must be evaluated on its own merits and that the court will make its decision based on the evidence presented.
