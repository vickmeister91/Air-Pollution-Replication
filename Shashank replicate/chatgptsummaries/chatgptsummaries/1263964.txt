The court has issued several orders related to illegal sand mining and its detrimental effects on the environment. The first court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, by M.K. Janardhanam against the District Collector, Tiruvallur District, and other officials for wilful disobedience of orders of the court to stop illegal quarrying of sand and savudu from the riverbed and river bank of Kusasthalai River and adjacent patta lands in Jagannathapuram and Inam Agaram villages, Ponneri Taluk, Tiruvallur District. The petitioner had sought the appointment of an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the area and file a detailed report about the illegal activity. The Commissioner's report confirmed the illegal quarrying and damage to the embankment provided by the government. The court had directed the respondents to ensure that the illegal quarrying was stopped forthwith, but the petitioner alleged that the activity had resumed. The respondents denied the allegations and stated that they had taken action to arrest illicit quarrying and illegal transportation of sand. The court ordered the respondents to continue patrolling the area and take suitable action against those indulging in the unlawful act.

The second court order also pertains to illegal sand quarrying in a riverbed in Tamil Nadu. The court had previously ordered patrolling of the area to prevent unlawful activity, but the petitioner produced evidence showing that quarrying was still taking place. An advocate commissioner was appointed to investigate and found that illegal quarrying had continued unabated. The court sought the assistance of the Advocate General and the Collector filed an affidavit stating that steps were being taken to curb the activity. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting natural resources and cites the adverse impact of sand mining on the environment.

The third court order addresses the issue of illegal sand mining in rivers and its detrimental effects on the environment, including saline intrusion into groundwater, destruction of agriculture and mangrove ecosystems, and damage to bridges and railway tracks. The court orders the government to form a high-level committee to survey the situation and propose solutions, enact regulatory legislation, and take necessary steps to protect and improve the environment. The court also imposes a ban on sand mining near motor or rail bridges and mandates that the local public be consulted before granting licenses. The court emphasizes the fundamental duty of citizens to protect and improve the natural environment and orders the government to reimburse the petitioner for expenses incurred in bringing the issue to court.

The fourth court order pertains to remedial measures related to the internet and the IGP. However, it is not related to the issue of illegal sand mining and its detrimental effects on the environment.

Illegal sand mining is a major problem in India, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu.
