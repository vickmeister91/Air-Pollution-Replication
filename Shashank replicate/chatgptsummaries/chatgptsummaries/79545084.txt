The court order pertains to a criminal case against Salman Khan for allegedly hunting two black bucks without a valid arms license in 1998. The prosecution filed two applications in 2006, which were allowed by the trial court in 2015, to produce additional evidence and witnesses. The petitioner argued that the orders were against the principles of fair trial and would cause prejudice to him. The court rejected the preliminary objection of the maintainability of the petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and held that the orders were interlocutory in nature and revision was not maintainable.

The court order states that the revision was not maintainable and the judge could not have interfered in his revisional jurisdiction. The impugned judgment is set aside, and the appeals are allowed. The court discusses the maintainability of revision and the summoning of witnesses and documents under Sections 311 and 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court concludes that additional witnesses and documents can be summoned if they are necessary for the just decision of the case. The court also notes that oversight or error by the prosecution should not prevent the court from correcting mistakes and rectifying the record.

The court order states that the court has the power to summon or recall any witness at any stage of the case if it is necessary for a just decision. Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. permits the calling of a witness and producing documents at any stage as long as they are relevant and essential for a just decision. The court must exercise this power judiciously and with caution. The court must determine whether the evidence sought to be led in is necessary for a just decision of the case. The court must ensure that the evidence is germane to the issue involved and that an opportunity of rebuttal is given to the other party. The court must invoke this power only to meet the ends of justice for strong and valid reasons and exercise it with care, caution, and circumspection. The court must bear in mind that fair trial entails the interest of the accused, the victim, and the society, and the grant of fair and proper opportunities to the persons concerned must be ensured. 

The court order dismisses the objection that the application has been moved only to fill a lacuna and states that the right of the petitioner can always be safeguarded by granting equal opportunity to cross-examine, lead evidence, etc. in accordance with law. The court finds no ground to interfere in the impugned orders dated 03.03.2015 passed by the trial court.

In summary, the court order pertains to a criminal case against Salman Khan for allegedly hunting two black bucks without a valid arms license in 1998.
