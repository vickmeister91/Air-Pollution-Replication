The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s N.R. Industries for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by discharging untreated trade effluent into a drain without obtaining consent from DPCC. The accused pleaded not guilty but was convicted. The court considered relevant provisions of the Act and witness testimonies before making the decision.

In another case, the court order prohibits the establishment of any industry or process likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer, or land without the consent of the State Board. The case involves the prosecution of M/s N.R. Industries for discharging effluent without mandatory consent from the DPCC. The accused argues that the complaint is not maintainable and that the unit was not working at the time of inspection. However, the court finds the accused's arguments to be unfounded and convicts them for the alleged offenses.

In a third case, the court order states that the accused, Nathu Ram, was found guilty of operating an electroplating unit without obtaining requisite consent from DPCC and discharging untreated effluent directly into the public sewer/drain. The court rejected the accused's arguments that no sample was taken and no notice was given, stating that sample collection is not necessary and notice was not required as the unit was not in operation prior to the Act. The accused was convicted for the offence under sections 24/25/26 of the Act and will be heard on sentence on 26.03.2015.

All three cases involve violations of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which aims to prevent and control water pollution. The Act requires industries to obtain consent from the State Pollution Control Board before discharging any effluent into water bodies or land. The Act also provides for penalties and punishment for violations.
