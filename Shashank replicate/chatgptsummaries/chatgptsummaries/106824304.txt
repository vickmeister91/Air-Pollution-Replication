The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Devender Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water, analyze them, and report the findings. The report reveals that the water in the clean water reservoir is normal, but the court orders the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state is directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and directs citizens to be made aware of this through notices. The court also directs the District Collector to be present with relevant records on the next posting date.

The order directs the removal of all encroachments within one month and the provision of assistance by various officials. The State Government is also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000/- from them. The compliance report filed by the State Government is found to be lacking, and the court orders compliance with its directions in letter and spirit.

The court orders a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for the removal of encroachments.

The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief, as it has jurisdiction over civil cases involving environmental issues. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order states that the original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not been decided yet. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The case is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which has the power to condone the delay. The remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India. The writ petition is dismissed with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
