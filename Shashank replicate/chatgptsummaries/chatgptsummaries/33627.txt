The Indian judiciary has recently issued two court orders pertaining to disputes over the usage of loudspeakers in public spaces. The first case involves a dispute between the Puthenveettil Nagar Kavu Trust and the District Collector regarding the usage of loudspeakers for playing devotional songs during poojas conducted in a "Sarpa Kavu" owned and maintained by the petitioner Trust. The issue has been challenged multiple times before the court, with the District Collector issuing orders under the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000. The court has heard arguments from both parties and has taken into account previous orders and reports before issuing a judgment.

In this case, the court has ruled in favor of the District Collector, upholding the orders issued under the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000. The court found that the use of loudspeakers during poojas in the "Sarpa Kavu" was causing noise pollution and disturbing the peace of the surrounding area. The court also noted that the petitioner Trust had not obtained the necessary permissions from the authorities to use loudspeakers in the area. Therefore, the court ordered the petitioner Trust to stop using loudspeakers during poojas in the "Sarpa Kavu" and to comply with the orders issued by the District Collector under the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000.

The second case pertains to a petitioner who was attempting to use a public address system in violation of statutory provisions and directions of competent authorities. The area in question was declared a 'silence zone' under the Environment Protection Act, and the usage of loudspeakers was prohibited. The court found that the order issued by the authority was legal and valid, and there was no ground to interfere with the factual findings arrived at. The writ petition was dismissed.

In this case, the court has upheld the order issued by the competent authority declaring the area a 'silence zone' and prohibiting the use of loudspeakers. The court found that the petitioner had violated the statutory provisions and directions of the competent authorities by attempting to use a public address system in the area. The court also noted that the area had been declared a 'silence zone' under the Environment Protection Act, and the usage of loudspeakers was prohibited in such areas. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner.

These court orders highlight the importance of complying with the statutory provisions and directions of competent authorities regarding the usage of loudspeakers in public spaces. The courts have emphasized the need to protect the environment and maintain peace and tranquility in the surrounding areas. The orders also emphasize the need for obtaining necessary permissions from the authorities before using loudspeakers in public spaces. Failure to comply with these provisions can result in legal action and penalties. Therefore, it is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the rules and regulations regarding the usage of loudspeakers in public spaces and to comply with them to avoid legal consequences.
