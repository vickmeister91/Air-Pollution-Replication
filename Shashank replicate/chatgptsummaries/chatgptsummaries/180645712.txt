The petitioner, D. Muralidharan, had filed a petition under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to call for the tower report of the mobile numbers of various individuals, including the defacto complainant, in order to prove his innocence. The petitioner had been accused of committing a crime and had sought to use the tower report as evidence to prove his innocence. However, the petition was dismissed by the X Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, and the court has upheld the dismissal order.

The court has directed the learned Magistrate to dispose of the case on a priority basis and has dispensed with the petitioner's appearance before the trial court, except if the Magistrate deems it necessary. This means that the case will be heard and decided upon quickly, and the petitioner will not be required to appear in court unless the Magistrate deems it necessary.

The court's decision to uphold the dismissal order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following due process in criminal cases. The tower report, while potentially useful as evidence, cannot be obtained without following the proper legal procedures. The court's decision also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights and to seek legal counsel when necessary.

Overall, the court order in question serves as a reminder of the importance of due process in criminal cases and the need for individuals to be aware of their legal rights. While the petitioner's request for the tower report was dismissed, the court has directed the learned Magistrate to dispose of the case on a priority basis, ensuring that justice is served in a timely manner.
