The court order pertains to a dispute between Essar Oil Ltd. and Halar Utkarsh Samiti & Ors. regarding the laying of pipelines to pump crude oil from a single buoy mooring in the Gulf across a portion of the Marine National Park and Marine Sanctuary to their oil refineries in Jamnagar District. The court examines the interpretation of the provisions of three statutes, namely, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to determine whether pipelines carrying crude oil can be permitted to go through the Marine National Park and Sanctuary and if Essar Oil Ltd. has been permitted to do so. The court grants leave in all the matters and takes up the appeals relating to Essar Oil first.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 29 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and whether the laying of pipelines through a sanctuary is permissible. The court found that the laying of crude oil pipeline was not necessary or indispensable for the purpose of improvement and better management of the wildlife and therefore no permit could be granted under Section 29. The court also emphasized the need to balance economic development with environmental considerations and referred to the Stockholm Declaration of 1972. The court concluded that permits allowing activities relating to the habitat and covered by prohibitions (b) and (c) do not require the State Government to come to the conclusion that the proposed activities should result in the betterment of wild life before it can be allowed. The court also compared the legal position in other countries and found that in England, for example, there is no absolute prohibition on laying pipelines.

The court order discusses the laying of pipelines and the need for the government to ensure that the route, design, and capacity of the pipelines do not interfere with sustainable development of the environment. The Pipelines Act, 1962 covers the laying of pipelines across the country, and the CRZ notifications allow the laying of pipelines across ecologically sensitive areas. However, the State Government must consider whether the damage caused by the proposed activity is reversible or not before granting approval. The court also discusses the appellant's case and the permissions granted by the Central Government and State Government for laying pipelines in the Marine National Park and Sanctuary area at Vadinar. The court notes that the permissions were granted subject to compliance with various conditions and environmental safeguards.

The court order pertains to the permission granted to a company to install marine facilities in a sanctuary area, which is also a part of forest land. The permission is subject to clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The company had invested heavily in the project and obtained finances from various institutions. However, due to public interest litigation and other factors, the permission was delayed, and the matter went to court. The court found that the company had taken precautions to minimize damage to wildlife and the environment and allowed the project to proceed with certain conditions. The court also noted that corals had been included in Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and the company would need to survey the area and prepare a management plan for relocation of corals coming in the way of the proposed pipeline. The State Government was directed to issue the authorization in the requisite format within a fortnight.
