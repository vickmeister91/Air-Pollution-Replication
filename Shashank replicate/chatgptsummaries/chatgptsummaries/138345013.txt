The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner sought initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against the respondents for allegedly interfering with the due course and administration of justice by making false statements and suppressing documents to obtain an ex parte order. The petitioner also sought action against the respondents under Article 215 of the Constitution of India. The court heard the petitioner and perused various documents filed by her, but ultimately held that the petition under Sections 2, 12 and 14 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 shall not be maintainable in these facts and circumstances to correct any error committed by the Learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition of the Banking Corporation against the interim order of the Industrial Adjudicator granting her interim relief.

The court order states that the ratio of one case cannot be applied to another case without considering the facts and circumstances of each case. The court also rejects the petitioner's claim that the respondents made false statements and played a fraud causing prejudice to the petitioner. The court further states that there is no merit in the petition and dismisses it. The court also declines to issue a notice to show cause against the respondents for contempt of court.
