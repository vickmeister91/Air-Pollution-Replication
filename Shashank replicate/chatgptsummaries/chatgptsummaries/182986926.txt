The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by DVC Emta Coal Mines against an order by the Pollution Control Appellate Authority of West Bengal. The order required the appellant to pay Rs. 10 lakh as pollution cost for non-compliance of environmental norms due to dumping overburden generated from mining activity in the nearby area. The appellant argued that the mining operation had not yet started and that the authorities had failed to establish that overburden of the mining material was generated by the appellant. The court considered whether the appeal involved a substantial question of law and admitted it for hearing.

In another case, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board directed an appellant to pay Rs. 10 lakh as pollution costs. However, the court found that the directions issued by the Board cannot be treated as a "Decree" of the Civil Court, and that the Board did not have the power to direct payment of pollution costs. The court also noted that the Board did not follow the procedure required by law for issuing such directions. As a result, the court found the direction issued by the Board to be bad in law and set it aside.

The court found that the WB Pollution Control Board made an error in directing the appellant to pay a pollution cost of Rs. 10 lakh and that the Appellate Authority also erred in confirming such order. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned direction to deposit the pollution cost of Rs. 10 lakh by the appellant. The court also stated that if the other conditions shown in the order are not complied with by the appellant, the Pollution Control Board is at liberty to take further action in accordance with the law, including refusal to grant consent to operate.
