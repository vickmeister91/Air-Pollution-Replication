The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Trans Asia Carpets Ltd. and its directors seeking to quash criminal proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The company had allegedly discharged trade affluence into a stream without obtaining the required consent from the State Board. The court held that the directors could be prosecuted if they were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business. 

The court also stated that the proper forum to decide questions of fact related to the extent of pollution and the discharge of affluence into a stream was the judicial magistrate concerned, and not the High Court. This decision is significant as it reinforces the principle that the High Court should not interfere in matters that are best left to lower courts to decide. 

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of State Pollution Control Boards to monitor and enforce the provisions of the Act. The Act also lays down penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.
