The National Green Tribunal in New Delhi has issued a court order that consolidates several appeal cases involving various parties and respondents, including the State of West Bengal and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. The cases pertain to the noise level standards for manufacturing and sale of firecrackers in the state of West Bengal. The applicants sought more liberal noise level standards and challenged the orders of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The court consolidated the applications and treated Appeal No. 53(THC)/2013 as the leading case. The court provided a brief history of the case and stated the case put forth by the applicants. The court did not address the incidental relief sought by the applicants.

The court order dated 03.10.1997 fixed the maximum permissible noise level of fireworks at 90 dB(A) impulse noise at 5 meters from the source and banned the use or sale of fireworks that produce noise above this level in the state of West Bengal. The order was challenged by traders and a society of traders, but the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the order and dismissed the challenge. Subsequently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the use of firecrackers generating noise levels up to 125dB(A-I) or 145dB(C)pk at 4 meters distance from the point of bursting and prohibited any use of firecrackers beyond this limit. The WBPCB passed the impugned order dated 03.10.1997, banning the manufacturing of firecrackers that produce sound of more than 90dB(A-I) at 5 meters from the point of bursting. The National Committee on Noise Pollution Control recommended that the maximum noise level for firecrackers could be 125dB(A-I) with impulse level of 4 meters from the source, which was ultimately approved. The WBPCB and other respondents denied the allegations made by the applicants challenging the order.

The court order discusses a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers generating noise levels exceeding 90 dB(A) impulse at a distance of 5 meters from the source in the state of West Bengal. The order was issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) under Rule 3(2) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The order was challenged by the appellants who argued that the limit of 90dB(A-I) for firecrackers only for the state of West Bengal is impermissible having regard to national norms of 125dB(A-I). The court examined the rival contentions put forth by the parties and formulated points for determination. The court also referred to a subsequent judgment of the Apex Court in "Noise Pollution (V), in RE: with Forum Prevention of Environmental and Sound Pollution Vs. UOI and Anr." (2005) 5SCC 733, which covers a large area with detailed consideration of various issues related to noise pollution.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by firecrackers during the Diwali festival in India. The court notes that bursting firecrackers can lead to non-recoverable hearing loss and contributes significantly to air pollution. The court also cites studies that show that the ambient noise level on Diwali day exceeded the limit at almost all places during the festival. The court upholds the maximum permissible sound level for firecrackers as fixed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and notes that the West Bengal Pollution Control Board should have reconciled its order with the ministry's notification. The court emphasizes that citizens have the right to a decent environment and the right to live peacefully, which are necessary ingredients of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses the hasty decision made by the WBPCB in accepting the recommendations of an expert committee without proper evaluation and consideration of other materials and views. The court also notes that the WBPCB has the power to lower the benchmark for decibels for firecrackers, but this must be based on sufficient reasons and a scientific study of the impact on the recipient system. The court also emphasizes that the MoEF Notification issued under the main provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 should be given precedence over subordinate legislation, and the impugned order of the WBPCB is unsustainable in the eye of the law. The court also discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the functions of the State Board in laying down standards for emission of air pollutants.

The court order states that the State Board cannot make unilateral decisions regarding emission standards for air pollutants from industrial plants and automobiles without consulting the Central Board. The impugned Notification issued by the WBPCB is deemed illegal and inoperative. The WBPCB is required to amend the order and reconcile it with the MoEF Notification. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) is directed to conduct a fresh study on "Noise Pollution and its Impacts" and suggest specific norms for manufacturing, sale, and distribution of firecrackers inter-state and intra-state. The WBPCB is at liberty to take independent decisions in consultation with the CPCB if the reduction of noise level from firecrackers is found necessary for certain specific reasons. The applications are partly allowed in terms of findings recorded hereinabove.

In summary, the court order
