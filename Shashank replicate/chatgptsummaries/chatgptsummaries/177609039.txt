The Bombay High Court has issued a court order in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Sambhuraje Yuvakranti of Akhil Bhartiya Maratha Seva Sangh against the authorities under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code for failing to take action against illegal constructions of bungalows/farmhouses in coastal villages of Varsoli, Sasavne, Navedhar, Navgaon, Kolgaon, Avas in Taluka-Alibaug, District-Raigad. The PIL seeks a writ of mandamus against the respondents directing them to remove the illegal constructions and stop all illegal constructions in the areas covered by the Coastal Zone Regulations.

The court has issued a rule considering the seriousness of the issues raised in the PIL. The court has also received affidavits from the District Collector, Raigad, and the Sub-Divisional Officer, Alibaug, regarding illegal constructions found in various villages and the actions taken against them. The court order discusses the illegal construction of structures in Alibaug Taluka in violation of CRZ Regulations. Notices have been issued for some structures, while others have been demolished. 

The District Collector filed an affidavit with a chart of 159 illegal structures, but the court found that the Collector and Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) had not taken appropriate action. The court cites the case of Shri Nirav Modi, who carried out excess construction without permission and was directed to remove it, but the SDO sought guidance from MCZMA instead of passing a final order. The court orders the Collector and SDO to explain their actions. 

An affidavit filed later reveals that the SDO disposed of the matter by directing a report to be submitted to MCZMA, and the Collector failed to take appropriate action. The court has directed the Divisional Commissioner, Konkan Division to investigate more than 160 illegal constructions in various coastal villages of Taluka-Alibaug, District-Raigad, and ascertain in what manner action has been initiated in respect of these constructions. 

The court has also directed the State Government to forward a copy of the petition, affidavits, and orders passed in this petition to the Divisional Commissioner. The court has expressed concern over the non-application of mind by the authorities and the violation of CRZ regulations and illegal constructions in coastal areas, which can lead to the destruction of the ecosystem and violate fundamental rights of citizens. 

The court has also noted the shocking conduct of the District Collector in the case of Shri Nirav Modi and directed an inquiry into the matter. The court has ordered the State Government to issue necessary directions within eight weeks based on the uploaded order. The seventh respondent must file an affidavit within six weeks, detailing decisions made on references and other aspects. 

The concerned authorities are free to take action against illegal constructions. The writ petition will be listed for compliance reporting on November 21, 2018. The court order highlights the need for strict enforcement of CRZ regulations and the importance of protecting the ecosystem and fundamental rights of citizens. The authorities have been directed to take appropriate action against illegal constructions and to explain their actions in cases where they have failed to do so. The court has also ordered an inquiry into the conduct of the District Collector in the case of Shri Nirav Modi. The State Government has been directed to issue necessary directions within eight weeks based on the uploaded order.
