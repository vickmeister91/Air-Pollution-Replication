The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail made by Rajesh, who is the first accused in a crime registered under the provisions of the Wild Life Act. The allegations against Rajesh are that he trespassed into the forest and shot down a giant squirrel using a gun, and the meat of the giant squirrel was found in his house. The court dismissed the application for anticipatory bail, stating that there are no circumstances justifying the invocation of the extraordinary equitable discretion under Section 438 Cr.P.C. The petitioner must appear before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction and then seek bail in the regular and ordinary course.

The case against Rajesh is a serious one, as it involves the violation of wildlife laws. The allegations against him are that he trespassed into the forest and shot down a giant squirrel using a gun, and the meat of the giant squirrel was found in his house. These actions are in clear violation of the Wild Life Act, which seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The court's decision to dismiss the application for anticipatory bail is therefore not surprising, as the allegations against Rajesh are serious and warrant a thorough investigation.

The court's decision to dismiss the application for anticipatory bail is based on the fact that there are no circumstances justifying the invocation of the extraordinary equitable discretion under Section 438 Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code allows a person to seek anticipatory bail in certain circumstances, such as when they fear arrest for a non-bailable offence. However, the court found that the circumstances of this case did not warrant the invocation of this section, as the allegations against Rajesh are serious and require a thorough investigation.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of appearing before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction and then seeking bail in the regular and ordinary course. This is because the regular and ordinary course of seeking bail allows for a thorough investigation of the allegations against the accused, and ensures that justice is served. By appearing before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction and then seeking bail in the regular and ordinary course, Rajesh will have the opportunity to present his case and defend himself against the allegations made against him.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the application for anticipatory bail made by Rajesh is a clear indication of the seriousness of the allegations against him. The court found that there are no circumstances justifying the invocation of the extraordinary equitable discretion under Section 438 Cr.P.C., and that Rajesh must appear before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction and then seek bail in the regular and ordinary course. This decision highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that justice is served in cases involving serious allegations such as those made against Rajesh.
