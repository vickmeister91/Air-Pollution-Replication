The court has granted anticipatory bail to Chitranjan Saw in connection with Forest Case No.20 of 2012. The case pertains to the offence under Sections 33, 41, 42 of Indian Forest Act and under Section 2 of Forest Conservation Act. The petitioner has been falsely implicated in the case and has no criminal antecedent. The court has directed that he be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Bermo at Tenughat within four weeks from the date of the order.

The order comes as a relief to Chitranjan Saw, who had been accused of violating the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioner had argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that he had no criminal antecedent. The court, after considering the arguments put forth by the petitioner, has granted him anticipatory bail.

Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This provision is available to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offence. The grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the furnishing of bail bonds and sureties.

In this case, the court has directed Chitranjan Saw to furnish bail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Bermo at Tenughat within four weeks from the date of the order. This means that Chitranjan Saw will have to provide a sum of Rs. 10,000/- as security, along with two sureties who will also provide a similar amount as security. The sureties will have to satisfy the learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Bermo at Tenughat that they are financially capable of providing the security.

The court has granted anticipatory bail to Chitranjan Saw on the grounds that he has been falsely implicated in the case and that he has no criminal antecedent. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the petitioner has cooperated with the investigation and has not absconded. The court has therefore deemed it fit to grant anticipatory bail to Chitranjan Saw.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a significant relief for Chitranjan Saw, as it means that he will not be arrested in connection with the case. However, it is important to note that the grant of anticipatory bail does not mean that the case against him has been dismissed. The case will continue to be heard in court, and Chitranjan Saw will have to appear before the court as and when required.
