The petitioner, M/s Madeshwara Stone Crusher, had been issued a closure notice by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981. The closure notice was issued on the grounds that the petitioner had failed to obtain the necessary consent to operate from the pollution control board and had violated various environmental regulations. The petitioner had also been issued a show-cause notice by the Deputy Commissioner of Bangalore Urban District, asking why action should not be taken against them for operating the stone crushing unit without the necessary permissions.

In response to the closure notice, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court, seeking to quash the notice and seeking permission to operate the crushing unit pending consideration of their application for consent to operate. The petitioner argued that they had applied for consent to operate on 11.10.2012 and had not received any response from the pollution control board. They also argued that they had not violated any environmental regulations and had taken all necessary precautions to prevent pollution.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and quashed the closure notice. The court noted that the petitioner had applied for consent to operate on 11.10.2012 and had not received any response from the pollution control board. The court also noted that the petitioner had taken various measures to prevent pollution, such as installing dust suppression systems and enclosing the crushing unit in a shed. The court further noted that the closure notice had been issued without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard and without considering their application for consent to operate.

The court directed the respondents to permit the operation of the petitioner's stone crushing unit at the present site till such time its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all environmental regulations and to obtain the necessary permissions from the pollution control board.

This court order has significant implications for the stone crushing industry in Karnataka. It highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to environmental regulations. It also emphasizes the need for government bodies to consider applications for consent to operate in a timely manner and to give the affected parties an opportunity to be heard before taking any punitive action. The court order provides a framework for the stone crushing industry to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, while also protecting the environment and the health of the local population.
