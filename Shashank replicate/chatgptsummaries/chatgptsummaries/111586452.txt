The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by a man named Harish under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Harish had been in custody since July 13th, 2018 in connection with a case registered at Police Station Piplaud District Khandwa (M.P.) for the offences punishable under Sections 9, 39, 44, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act and 25/27 of Arms Act. 

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court allowed Harish's bail application and directed that he be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court for his appearance before them on the dates given by the concerned Court. 

It is important to note that the offences Harish was charged with are serious in nature and carry significant penalties. Section 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 pertains to the possession of any captive animal or animal article. Section 44 deals with the killing or hunting of any wild animal, while Section 51 pertains to the seizure of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft used for committing an offence under the Act. 

In addition, Harish was also charged under Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act, which deal with the illegal possession of firearms. These offences are taken very seriously by the Indian legal system and can result in significant jail time and fines. 

Given the seriousness of the charges against Harish, it is notable that the court granted him bail. This suggests that the court may have found some merit in Harish's arguments or may have determined that he is not a flight risk or a danger to society. 

It is also worth noting that the court imposed certain conditions on Harish's bail, including the requirement that he furnish a bail bond and surety. These conditions are designed to ensure that Harish appears before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court and does not flee from justice. 

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the bail system in the Indian legal system. Bail allows individuals who have been charged with a crime to be released from custody while they await trial. However, bail is not a right and is granted at the discretion of the court. In this case, the court determined that Harish was eligible for bail, but imposed certain conditions to ensure that he appears before the trial court and does not flee from justice.
