In May 2009, the Supreme Court of India issued a court order regarding the optimization of land and ecological degradation in an area of the Aravalli Hill Range. The court considered whether the situation warranted a total stoppage of mining activity, as stated in a previous judgment. The court reviewed the history of relevant orders passed and ultimately prohibited and banned all mining activity in the entire Aravalli hills. The court also required that environmental impact assessments be done before any mining activity could be permitted.

The court order prohibits and bans mining activities in the entire Aravalli hills, extending from Haryana to Rajasthan. Mining may only be permitted in forest areas with specific prior approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, and no mining activity is permitted within areas that are notified as Sanctuary, National Park, or Game Reserve. The Central Empowered Committee will give suggestions within six weeks, and no mining activity will be permitted in areas where there is a dispute of applicability of the FC Act. The order also highlights the consequences of continuous violation of rules and the irreversible changes in the environment due to extensive mining.

The court order states that mining operations should be undertaken on the principle of sustainable development and that a complete ban on mining should not be imposed as it generates revenue for the state. However, if degradation of the environment continues and reaches a stage of no-return, the court may consider the closure of mining activity. The State of Haryana has decided to close mining activity in the Aravalli Hill Range due to the degradation caused by extensive mining operations. The court emphasizes the importance of compliance with environmental and forest statutes and the preparation of mining plans and environmental management plans. The court also notes the non-compliance of mining operations in the past and the devastation caused by extensive mining in the Aravalli Hill Range. The court orders the immediate suspension of mining operations in the area. The court also discusses previous orders related to mining in the area.

The court order discusses the issue of mining in the Aravalli Hill range in the state of Haryana. The lessees argued that there was no complete ban on mining operations, but the court found that a ban was necessary due to the degradation of the environment. The court cited previous orders and guidelines, including the need for environmental clearance and the prohibition of mining in certain areas. The court rejected arguments from the lessees that a ban should only be imposed as a last resort and that they had obtained clearances for some projects. The court ordered a ban on mining operations in the entire Aravalli Hill range in the state of Haryana. The court also discussed the legal parameters of canceling mining leases in cases of environmental degradation.

The court order suspends all mining operations in the Aravalli Hill Range in the State of Haryana until a reclamation plan is prepared and certified by the State of Haryana, MoEF, and CEC. The plan must comply with various statutory provisions and guidelines for rehabilitation and reclamation. The court will also consider granting permission for the excavation of minor minerals in a localized area after the summer vacation. The order cites the importance of balancing mining activity with environmental protection and the principle of sustainable development. It also notes the failure to comply with provisions for rehabilitation and reclamation in past mining operations.

The court order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development in the Aravalli Hill Range. The court has recognized the irreversible damage caused by extensive mining operations and has taken a strong stance against further degradation of the environment. The court has emphasized the importance of compliance with environmental and forest statutes and the preparation of mining plans and environmental management plans. The court has also recognized the need to balance mining activity with environmental protection and the principle of sustainable development.

The court order has far-reaching implications for the mining industry in India. The ban on mining activity in the Aravalli Hill Range will have a significant impact on the revenue generated by the mining industry. The court has also set a precedent for future cases involving environmental degradation caused by mining activity. The court has made it clear that the environment must be protected, and mining activity must be undertaken on the principle of sustainable development.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Supreme Court of India in May 2009 regarding the optimization of land and ecological degradation in an area of the Aravalli Hill Range is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The court has recognized the irreversible damage caused by extensive mining operations and has taken a strong stance against further degradation of the environment. The court has emphasized the importance of compliance with environmental and forest statutes and the preparation of mining plans and environmental management plans. The court has also recognized the need to balance mining activity with environmental protection and the principle of sustainable development. The court order has far-reaching implications for the mining industry in India and sets a precedent for future cases involving environmental degradation caused by mining activity.
