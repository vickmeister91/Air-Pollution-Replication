In the first court order, the petitioner, Ravi Raju A, had filed a suit against Shriram Transport Finance for permanent injunction to restrain them from interfering with his possession of a lorry. However, the respondent had filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, stating that there was an arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties. The trial court had allowed the application and stayed further proceedings in the suit, referring the dispute to an arbitrator in Chennai. 

The petitioner had challenged this order, stating that there was no arbitration agreement in existence. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment. After considering the arguments, the court issued a final order in the case. The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ravi Raju A against Shriram Transport Finance. The court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner, upholding the trial court's decision to refer the dispute to an arbitrator in Chennai.

The court found that there was indeed an arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties, and therefore, the trial court's decision to stay further proceedings in the suit and refer the dispute to an arbitrator was correct. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that there was no arbitration agreement in existence. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition due to the lack of evidence supporting the petitioner's contention.

In summary, the court order in this case upholds the trial court's decision to refer the dispute to an arbitrator in Chennai, based on the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties. The court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner due to the lack of evidence supporting his claim that there was no arbitration agreement in existence.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of carefully reviewing and understanding the terms of any agreement before entering into it, particularly with regards to dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration clauses. It also emphasizes the need for parties to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims in court. 

In conclusion, the court order in this case serves as a reminder to parties to carefully consider their options and provide sufficient evidence to support their claims in court. It also highlights the importance of understanding the terms of any agreement before entering into it, particularly with regards to dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration clauses.
