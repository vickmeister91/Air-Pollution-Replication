The recent court order pertains to a case where Seshasayee Paper and Board Ltd. challenged the validity of the levy imposed upon it by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act. The petitioner claimed that it was entitled to a rebate of 70% under Section 7 of the Act as it had installed an effluent treatment plant. However, the court rejected the petitioner's contentions and upheld the validity of the assessment and the order of the Appellate Authority.

The court considered various provisions of the Act and the Rules and held that the Cess Act was introduced to facilitate and achieve the objects of the Pollution Act. The court also referred to a Division Bench judgment that industries may obtain a rebate to the extent of 70% if they set up a water treatment plant. However, the court stated that the extent of treatment provided by the plant should be determined before granting the rebate.

The court order states that a water treatment plant has been set up to treat the effluent of a factory and prevent the public from using contaminated or polluted water. The court has referred to various decisions and rules to interpret the law and concluded that the owners of industries who have installed water treatment plants are entitled to a rebate on the cess imposed for treating water.
