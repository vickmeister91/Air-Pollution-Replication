The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Cr. P.C., 1973, for quashing of the F.I.R. of Sikidiri P.S.Case No.32 of 2013, corresponding to G.R. No.4852 of 2013, for the offence under Rules 54 & 67 of the Jharkhand Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 2004, and Sections 21A, 31A and 37 of Air (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, now pending in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi.

The petitioners have made several submissions, including that the informant ought to have filed a complaint instead of lodging the First Information Report, and that no notice was given to the person who was to be prosecuted 60 days prior in the manner prescribed. The court has issued notice upon the opposite party no.2, by registered post with A/D as well as under ordinary process, and has ordered that there shall not be any coercive steps against the present petitioners in connection with Sikidiri P.S. Case No.32 of 2013, corresponding to G.R. No.4852 of 2013, pending in the court of learned Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi, till 8th January, 2015.

The case in question involves the alleged violation of mining and pollution control laws in Jharkhand. The petitioners have argued that the informant should have filed a complaint instead of lodging an F.I.R., and that proper notice was not given prior to prosecution. The court has issued notice to the opposite party and has ordered that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioners until a specified date.

Section 482 of the Cr. P.C., 1973, allows for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioners are seeking to have the F.I.R. quashed on the grounds that proper procedure was not followed and that the charges are baseless.

The Jharkhand Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 2004, govern the mining industry in the state of Jharkhand. Rule 54 pertains to the grant of mining leases, while Rule 67 deals with the suspension or cancellation of such leases. The alleged violation of these rules suggests that the petitioners may have engaged in illegal mining activities.

Sections 21A, 31A, and 37 of the Air (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, deal with the prevention and control of air pollution. The alleged violation of these sections suggests that the petitioners may have engaged in activities that have contributed to air pollution in the area.

The court's decision to issue notice to the opposite party and to order that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioners until a specified date suggests that the court is taking the petitioners' arguments seriously and is willing to consider their case. However, it remains to be seen whether the court will ultimately quash the F.I.R. or allow the case to proceed.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper procedure in legal matters and the potential consequences of violating mining and pollution control laws. It also underscores the role of the High Court in ensuring that justice is served and that the process of the court is not abused.
