In the first court order, a Letters Patent Appeal was filed against a judgment and order passed by a learned single judge in a writ petition. The appellant argued that the respondent-University did not follow the prescribed procedure under Ordinance 121A, and the charges against the appellant were vague and not definite. The inquiry proceedings were not conducted properly, and the final order containing the findings of the Committee was not communicated to the appellant. The court heard the arguments and observed that the contentions raised before the learned single judge were never raised before the Committee constituted by the respondent-University. The court dismissed the appeal.

Moving on to the second court order, the court states that the submissions made by the petitioner's advocate cannot be readily accepted as the decision-making process must be considered. The court refers to previous judgments that state that if there is sufficient material to demonstrate that the university was right in canceling exams, the university's appreciation of the problem must be respected. The court also emphasizes that the rules of natural justice do not apply in abstract and must be considered in the background of facts. The court further states that the principle of prejudice must be proved in addition to the violation of natural justice.

In the third court order, the court discusses the use of the "useless formality" theory in cases where there are admitted or indisputable facts leading to only one conclusion. The court also emphasizes the doctrine of prejudice in determining whether a breach has occurred. The court ultimately finds that the respondent-University did not commit any error in their decision to cancel the appellant's exam results due to mass copying. The court also rejects the appellant's request for a fresh mark-sheet. The appeal is dismissed.

In summary, the court orders revolve around appeals filed against judgments and orders passed by learned single judges in writ petitions. The first order deals with an appeal filed against a university for not following the prescribed procedure and conducting inquiry proceedings improperly. The court dismissed the appeal as the contentions raised were not raised before the Committee constituted by the respondent-University. The second order deals with the cancellation of exams by a university and emphasizes that the rules of natural justice must be considered in the background of facts. The court also states that the principle of prejudice must be proved in addition to the violation of natural justice. The third order deals with the use of the "useless formality" theory and the doctrine of prejudice in determining whether a breach has occurred. The court ultimately finds that the respondent-University did not commit any error in their decision to cancel the appellant's exam results due to mass copying and rejects the appellant's request for a fresh mark-sheet.
