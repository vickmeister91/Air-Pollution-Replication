The court order pertains to a petition for eviction on the grounds of bonafide requirement. The petitioner has sought recovery of possession of the tenanted premises for his grandson's marriage, pooja room, servant quarter, and residential purposes for his daughters. The respondent has filed a leave to defend application, stating that the petitioner's grounds are not genuine and that he has not disclosed the complete accommodation in the site plan. However, the court has dismissed the respondent's arguments, stating that they are not triable issues and has granted the petitioner's request for eviction.

The court has considered the petitioner's need for additional rooms for his family members, including a separate room for his grandson and a room for pooja, as a bonafide requirement. The respondent did not deny the petitioner's requirement for a yoga room and a room for a servant, and therefore, these are not triable issues. The court has also referred to previous cases where the requirement for guest rooms, pooja rooms, and rooms for attendants have been considered bonafide.

The court has dismissed the respondent's leave to defend application and passed an eviction order in favor of the petitioner for the shop on the ground floor. However, the order cannot be executed for six months.

The court's decision is based on the principle of bonafide requirement, which is a valid ground for eviction under the Rent Control Act. The Act provides for the protection of tenants from arbitrary eviction and ensures that landlords cannot evict tenants without a valid reason. The bonafide requirement of the landlord is one such valid reason.

In this case, the petitioner has established a bonafide requirement for the premises in question. The court has considered the petitioner's need for additional rooms for his family members, including a separate room for his grandson and a room for pooja, as a bonafide requirement. The court has also noted that the respondent did not deny the petitioner's requirement for a yoga room and a room for a servant.

The court has dismissed the respondent's arguments that the petitioner has not disclosed the complete accommodation in the site plan. The court has held that this is not a triable issue and has granted the petitioner's request for eviction.

The court has also referred to previous cases where the requirement for guest rooms, pooja rooms, and rooms for attendants have been considered bonafide. This shows that the court has considered the petitioner's requirement in light of the prevailing legal principles and has arrived at a decision based on the facts of the case.

The court's decision to pass an eviction order in favor of the petitioner for the shop on the ground floor is also based on the principle of bonafide requirement. The court has held that the petitioner has established a bonafide requirement for the shop on the ground floor and has dismissed the respondent's leave to defend application.

However, the court has also provided some relief to the respondent by staying the execution of the eviction order for six months. This means that the respondent has six months to vacate the premises and find alternative accommodation.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is based on the principle of bonafide requirement, which is a valid ground for eviction under the Rent Control Act. The court has considered the petitioner's requirement in light of the prevailing legal principles and has arrived at a decision based on the facts of the case. The court has granted the petitioner's request for eviction and has dismissed the respondent's leave to defend application.
