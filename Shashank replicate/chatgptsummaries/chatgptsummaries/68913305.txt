In a recent court order, Sahil and Veeru, who were accused of hunting birds in a forest area, were granted bail. It is important to note that the area in question is not a wildlife sanctuary, and the maximum sentence for the offense is three years. Additionally, the recovery of the birds has already been made.

The court allowed bail on the condition that each petitioner furnishes a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and two sureties of Rs.25,000 each. This means that the petitioners must provide a sum of money as a guarantee that they will appear in court for their trial. The sureties, on the other hand, are individuals who will vouch for the petitioners and provide a guarantee that they will not flee or abscond.

It is important to note that the bail will be cancelled if the petitioners are found guilty of similar or any other offense in the future. This condition is put in place to ensure that the petitioners do not engage in any illegal activities while they are out on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sahil and Veeru is significant as it highlights the importance of considering the circumstances of the offense and the nature of the area in which it was committed. In this case, the fact that the area was not a wildlife sanctuary may have played a role in the court's decision to grant bail.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision to grant bail is not a reflection of the petitioners' guilt or innocence. Rather, it is a decision based on the circumstances of the case and the likelihood of the petitioners appearing in court for their trial.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Sahil and Veeru highlights the importance of considering the circumstances of the offense and the nature of the area in which it was committed. It also emphasizes the importance of providing a guarantee that the petitioners will appear in court for their trial and not engage in any illegal activities while out on bail.
