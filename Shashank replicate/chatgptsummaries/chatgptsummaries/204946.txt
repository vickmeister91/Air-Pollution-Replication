The court order in question pertains to a revision petition against an order of the Additional Sessions Judge, No. 2 Alwar, dated 12th April, 1979. The case involves the forfeiture of surety bonds by Santokh Singh, who stood surety for a tractor and other articles that were seized by the police. The court found that the bonds were not executed in favor of the government, as required by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and therefore, the penalty could not be realized from the petitioner under Section 514(2), Cr. P.C.

The court cited previous cases to support its decision and emphasized that the language of the bond must be strictly construed. The court order states that the surety-bond in question did not provide forfeiture to the Union of India or the State of Rajasthan, but rather to the court of District Magistrate, Ganganagar. As a result, no action can be taken under Section 514 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the surety for the forfeiture of the bond.

The order of the lower courts to forfeit the amount mentioned in the bonds is incorrect, and the amount cannot be realized from the petitioner-surety, Santoksingh. The revision petition is accepted, and the previous orders are set aside.

The court's decision in this case is based on a strict interpretation of the Code of Criminal Procedure and previous case law. The court found that the surety bonds in question were not executed in favor of the government, as required by the Code, and therefore, the penalty could not be realized from the petitioner under Section 514(2), Cr. P.C.

The court emphasized that the language of the bond must be strictly construed, and that the surety-bond in question did not provide forfeiture to the Union of India or the State of Rajasthan, but rather to the court of District Magistrate, Ganganagar. As a result, no action can be taken under Section 514 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the surety for the forfeiture of the bond.

The court's decision in this case has important implications for the interpretation of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the enforcement of surety bonds. It underscores the importance of strict adherence to the language of the bond and the requirements of the Code in order to ensure that penalties can be realized from sureties in cases where they are required to stand surety.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of careful drafting and interpretation of surety bonds, and the need for strict adherence to the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to ensure that penalties can be realized from sureties when necessary.
