The Gujarat Positra Port Company Limited filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution to challenge the decision of the Standing Committee of National Board for Wild Life (NBWL) rejecting their proposal to carry out a study for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and risk assessment for the establishment of a port at Positra, Dist. Jamnagar. The petitioners sought to quash and set aside the two orders/decisions dated 12.4.2010 and 13.10.2010 of the Standing Committee of NBWL and requested necessary permission/clearance to conduct/carry out the EIA study.

The court order discusses a proposal to establish a port at Positra in Jamnagar, which was rejected by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wild Life due to the area's high ecological fragility and rich marine biodiversity. The decision was communicated to the petitioner company, who appealed to the National Environment Appellate Authority, but their appeal was rejected. The petitioners then appealed to the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, who referred the matter back to the Standing Committee for further consideration.

The petitioners argued that the decision was made without considering their detailed comments and violated principles of natural justice. The respondent argued that the Standing Committee was well within its powers to reject the proposal based on the area's fragility and the Swaminathan Committee report's recommendation against developing ports within 10 km of ecologically fragile areas. The court ultimately rejected the petitioners' arguments and upheld the Standing Committee's decision.

The court order states that the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife has the power to conduct site inspections and approve or reject proposed activities. The report from the site inspection of the proposed port site at Poshitra Bay revealed that the area is fragile and any activity would have a negative impact on the ecology, especially the coral reefs. The report recommended that either the port or the protected area could exist, but not both.

The court agrees with the expert team's opinion and rejects the petitioners' request for permission to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment study for the port development. The court also states that the petitioners do not have a legal right to seek a mandamus.

In summary, the Gujarat Positra Port Company Limited filed a petition to challenge the decision of the Standing Committee of National Board for Wild Life rejecting their proposal to carry out a study for Environmental Impact Assessment and risk assessment for the establishment of a port at Positra, Dist. Jamnagar. The court discussed the proposal and the decisions made by the Standing Committee and Ministry of Environment and Forests (Wild Life Division) regarding the proposal. Ultimately, the Ministry rejected the petitioner's proposal without giving any reply to their comments and opportunity to be heard.

The court upheld the Standing Committee's decision to reject the proposal based on the area's fragility and the Swaminathan Committee report's recommendation against developing ports within 10 km of ecologically fragile areas. The court also agreed with the expert team's opinion that the proposed port site at Poshitra Bay is fragile and any activity would have a negative impact on the ecology, especially the coral reefs. The court rejected the petitioners' request for permission to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment study for the port development and stated that the petitioners do not have a legal right to seek a mandamus.
