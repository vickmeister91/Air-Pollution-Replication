The court order pertains to a bail application filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) for an offence under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant had been in judicial custody since 14th December 2017 for allegedly possessing leopard skin and nail. The court allowed the application in favor of the applicant and ordered his release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference. The Act imposes strict penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, the applicant was accused of possessing leopard skin and nail, which are prohibited under the Act. The possession of such items is considered a serious offence as it involves the killing of a protected animal. The applicant had been in judicial custody for over a year, awaiting trial.

The bail application was filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C, which provides for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the pendency of a trial. The section empowers the court to grant bail if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence and that he is not likely to abscond or interfere with the course of justice.

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the bail application in favor of the applicant. The court observed that the applicant had been in custody for over a year and that the trial was not likely to commence in the near future. The court also noted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and that he was not likely to abscond or interfere with the course of justice.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions for the grant of bail. The applicant was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The surety was required to be a person of standing in the society and should be able to vouch for the applicant's good conduct. The court also directed the applicant to cooperate with the investigating agency and to attend all court hearings.

The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and it is based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court has to balance the interests of the accused with those of the society while deciding on a bail application. In this case, the court found that the applicant had made out a case for bail and that the conditions imposed were sufficient to ensure that he would not abscond or interfere with the course of justice.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a bail application filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C for an offence under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.
