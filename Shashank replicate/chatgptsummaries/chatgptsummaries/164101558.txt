The court order pertains to two criminal petitions filed against accused persons who were constructing residential flats without obtaining valid consent as per Section 25 of the Water Act. The first petition was filed by M/s Athashri Paranjape against The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, alleging that the accused persons did not obtain valid consent from the complainant and were also accused of creating pollution and damaging the property of the complainant. The second petition was filed by the accused persons themselves, who were charged with contravening Section 25 of the Water Act.

The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the relief sought in previous writ petitions was not relevant to this criminal petition. The court also cautioned against the abuse of the court process and stated that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the court. The court emphasized that criminal law relating to the environment should be administered in substance rather than form and technicalities should not obscure or defeat the purpose and object of criminal law.

In the first petition, the court noted that the accused persons did not obtain valid consent from the complainant as per Section 25 of the Water Act, which is a mandatory activity. The court also noted that the accused persons were accused of creating pollution and damaging the property of the complainant. The court, however, did not find any merit in the petition and dismissed it.

In the second petition, the accused persons were charged with contravening Section 25 of the Water Act. The court noted that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the court and dismissed the petition.

The court's emphasis on administering criminal law relating to the environment in substance rather than form is significant. It highlights the importance of focusing on the purpose and object of criminal law, which is to protect the environment and ensure that those who violate environmental laws are held accountable. The court's caution against the abuse of the court process is also noteworthy, as it serves as a reminder that the court's time and resources should not be wasted on frivolous or baseless petitions.

Overall, the court's order serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with environmental laws and the consequences of violating them. It also emphasizes the need for a substantive approach to administering criminal law relating to the environment, which prioritizes the protection of the environment and holds violators accountable.
