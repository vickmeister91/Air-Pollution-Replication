The court order pertains to two cases where residents of a locality complained about the discomfort caused by the loading and unloading of dry chillies by nearby businesses. In the first case, a commission agent stored and transported dry chillies in a godown located in the residential area. The residents complained of physical discomfort and health issues caused by the loading and unloading of the chillies. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate (S.D.M.) had issued a conditional order under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was later set aside by the Additional Sessions Judge. The applicants challenged this decision, arguing that the judge exceeded his jurisdiction by reassessing the evidence and arriving at a different conclusion. 

The court notes that the revisional jurisdiction of a court is limited and that findings of fact recorded by the trial court cannot be disturbed unless they are patently erroneous or illegal. The court ultimately sets aside the decision of the Additional Sessions Judge and upholds the order of the S.D.M. The court found that the learned S.D.M. was right in passing the conditional order under Section 133(1)(b) as well as the final order under Section 138 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the learned Additional Sessions Judge was not justified in interfering with the same. The order passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate was restored. 

In the second case, the non-applicant had obtained certificates from witnesses stating that they did not suffer due to the loading and unloading of dry chillies. However, the learned S.D.M. pointed out that the non-applicant had tampered with the witnesses. The court found that the learned S.D.M. was right in passing the conditional order under Section 133(1)(b) as well as the final order under Section 138 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the learned Additional Sessions Judge was not justified in interfering with the same. The order passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate was restored. 

The court notes that the purpose of Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code is to prevent public nuisance and to protect public health and safety. The court also notes that the power under Section 133 is a preventive measure and is not intended to punish the wrongdoer. The court further notes that the power under Section 133 is discretionary and should be exercised with caution and circumspection. The court emphasizes that the power under Section 133 should be exercised only when there is a clear and present danger to public health and safety. 

The court also notes that the power under Section 138 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a remedial measure and is intended to compensate the affected parties for the loss suffered by them due to the public nuisance. The court emphasizes that the compensation awarded under Section 138 should be reasonable and should not be excessive. The court also notes that the compensation awarded under Section 138 should be based on the actual loss suffered by the affected parties and should not be punitive in nature. 

In conclusion, the court upholds the orders passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate under Section 133 and Section 138 of the Criminal Procedure Code in both cases. The court emphasizes that the power under Section 133 should be exercised with caution and circumspection and should be used only when there is a clear and present danger to public health and safety. The court also emphasizes that the compensation awarded under Section 138 should be reasonable and should be based on the actual loss suffered by the affected parties.
