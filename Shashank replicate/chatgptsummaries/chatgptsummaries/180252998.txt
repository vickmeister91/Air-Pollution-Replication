The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition challenging circulars issued by the U.P. Power Corporation to pay a lump-sum amount in case of an accident. The petitioners had sought compensation of Rs. 50,00,000.00 for the death of a relative due to electrocution. However, the court found that the District Collector had already awarded a sum of Rs. 25,000/- under the Public Liabilities Insurance Act, 1991, and the petitioners had not challenged this order. The court also noted that the circulars had not been referred to by the District Collector in his order and that the appropriate remedy for the claimant in case of fatal accidents is to maintain a civil suit for damages and compensation.
