The fourth court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity, and the petitioners seek the quashing of the demand notice, a refund of the NPV deposited, and other appropriate orders. The court heard the petitions together and decided them by a common judgment. The court reviewed the facts of the case, including the policy letter dated 07.02.2000, the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on 01.04.2015, and the demand notice issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Udaipur on 17.10.2017. The court ultimately reserved judgment on 27/05/2019 and pronounced it on 30/05/2019.

The fifth court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the compensation amount. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the cluster of mining leases has been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and only 70 lease holders are interested in the extension of the validity period of diversion.

The sixth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The seventh court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land. The mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining leases were valid until 2017, and the lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area. However, 62 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and the lease holders refused to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court partially allowed the writ petitions and directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases that were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested lease holdings and divide the common area being used by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.
