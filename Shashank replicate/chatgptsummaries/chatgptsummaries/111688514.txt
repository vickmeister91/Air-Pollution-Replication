In the first court order, the State of Rajasthan appealed against the suspension of the order of conviction of Salman Salim Khan, who was convicted under the Wild Life (Protection Act), 1972. The High Court had allowed the suspension of the order of conviction on the ground that it was preventing the respondent from traveling abroad for professional reasons. The appellant argued that the suspension of conviction does not alter the fact of conviction and that there cannot be a blanket stay of conviction. The respondent argued that the suspension of conviction was necessary to prevent serious disqualification from visiting the UK due to applicable norms of the UK Entry Clearance. The court considered the rival contentions and upheld the suspension of conviction.

The second court order pertains to an applicant who has been convicted of a crime and seeks permission to travel abroad for work. The court acknowledges that the applicant has always abided by the conditions imposed by various courts and has never violated any of them. The court also notes that the applicant's profession requires him to travel abroad and that he is not a public servant nor has he been convicted of any corruption charges. The court cites previous cases to caution that the power to suspend conviction and sentence pending appeal/revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances where failure to do so would lead to injustice and irreversible consequences. The court sets aside the impugned judgment and remits the case to the High Court to decide the matter afresh, with the applicant having the opportunity to show that if the order of conviction is not stayed, it will cause irreversible consequences/injustice to him which cannot be undone if he ultimately succeeds.
