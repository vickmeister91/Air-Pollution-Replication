In a criminal petition filed by Shri Harishchandra Prasad, the petitioner sought to quash the complaint and FIR in Crime No. 273/2008 of Gadag Rural Police Station and the entire proceedings pursuant to it in C.C. No. 83/2009. The petitioner was accused of transporting black bucks without a permit or license. 

The court found that the complaint was not filed by an authorized person and directed the Assistant Conservator of Forest, Gadag Forest Division, to proceed with the case on the strength of the complaint filed by the Sub-Inspector of Police. The court also noted that the petitioner had already been acquitted in a similar case and that the prosecution had failed to establish that the black bucks were transported without a permit or license.

The court further observed that the petitioner had produced documents to show that he had obtained the necessary permits and licenses for transporting the black bucks. The court also noted that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to show that the petitioner had transported the black bucks without a permit or license.

Based on these findings, the court quashed the proceedings against the petitioner. The court held that the complaint was not filed by an authorized person and that the prosecution had failed to establish that the black bucks were transported without a permit or license. The court also noted that the petitioner had produced documents to show that he had obtained the necessary permits and licenses for transporting the black bucks.

This case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining the necessary permits and licenses when transporting wildlife. It also emphasizes the need for the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and to produce sufficient evidence to support their case.
