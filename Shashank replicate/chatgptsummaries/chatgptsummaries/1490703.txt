The court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Mohd. Shakeel Khan and another individual seeking to quash a First Information Report (FIR) lodged against them under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and Arms Act. The court found that the FIR disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence and therefore could not be quashed. However, the court provided that if the petitioners appeared before the court below and applied for bail, the application would be disposed of expeditiously, preferably on the same day.

The court, however, found that the FIR disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence and therefore could not be quashed. The court noted that the allegations against the petitioners were serious in nature and that the investigation was still ongoing. The court also observed that the petitioners had not been arrested yet and that they were free to apply for bail.

The court further provided that if the petitioners appeared before the court below and applied for bail, the application would be disposed of expeditiously, preferably on the same day. The court emphasized that the petitioners should cooperate with the investigation and that they should not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.
