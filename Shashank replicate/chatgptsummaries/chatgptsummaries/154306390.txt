The court has granted bail to Hare Singh, who was accused of attempting to kill a tiger cub and had been in jail for a year. The court allowed the bail application without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. The applicant has no previous criminal history, which may have been a factor in the court's decision to grant bail.

The court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant, which must be followed. The applicant must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and one solvent surety in the same amount to the satisfaction of CJM, Balaghat. The applicant must also abide by certain conditions, which have not been specified in the court order.

It is unclear why the court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case. It is possible that the court did not want to prejudice the case by expressing an opinion before the trial. Alternatively, the court may have felt that the evidence against the applicant was weak, and therefore, it was appropriate to grant bail.

The fact that the applicant has no previous criminal history may have been a significant factor in the court's decision to grant bail. The court may have felt that the applicant was not a flight risk or a danger to society, and therefore, it was appropriate to grant bail.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the applicant is innocent. The trial will still proceed, and the applicant will have to prove his innocence. However, the fact that the court has granted bail may be seen as a positive development for the applicant.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Hare Singh is significant. It shows that the court is willing to consider the individual circumstances of each case and make decisions based on the facts presented. It also highlights the importance of having no previous criminal history when applying for bail.
