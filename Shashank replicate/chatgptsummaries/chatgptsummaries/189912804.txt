The Ganga river is one of the most important rivers in India, and it is considered sacred by millions of Hindus. However, the river has been polluted due to the disposal of human waste and sewage, as well as industrial effluents. The pollution of the river has led to a public interest litigation case, with the petitioner claiming that the authorities have not taken any preventive or remedial measures to address the issue.

The court order adds four new respondents to the case, including the Uttarakhand Environment Protection & Pollution Control Board, which is criticized for not fulfilling its statutory duties. The court notes that every citizen has a right to clean water and that the Ganga river is a way of life for Hindus. The court also addresses the need to control and prevent pollution in the river, citing the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which contain stringent provisions to prevent pollution.

The court emphasizes the importance of enforcing laws related to environmental protection and the role of the court in ensuring that the government takes effective steps to enforce these laws. The order also emphasizes the principles of sustainable development, precautionary measures, and the polluter pays principle. The court cites various legal provisions and international agreements related to environmental protection and highlights the need for industries to balance development with ecological concerns.

The court also discusses the responsibilities of the State Pollution Control Board in maintaining the standards and parameters for maintaining the quality of water in the Ganga river. The court highlights the failure of the Board to take stern action against defaulters and urges the State Government to take appropriate action against the Board. The court also cites studies on the shrinking of the Gangotri glacier and the consequences of rising regional temperatures.

The court order identifies the need for urgent action to address the pollution of the river and protect the rights of riparian states to access clean water for irrigation, bathing, and drinking purposes. The Central Pollution Control Board has identified the major sources of pollution to be organic matter and bacterial population of faecal origin. The report also highlights the inadequate treatment capacity for sewage generated by Class-I and Class-II cities along the river.

The court directs municipal bodies to set up garbage treatment plants and orders the closure of tanneries that have failed to treat their industrial effluent. The court also recognizes the importance of preserving the ecology and environment of the Himalayas and forest growth. The court orders the state government to take measures to relocate the most polluting units, make suitable legislation to prohibit littering, urination, defecation, and spitting in public places, and ban the use and storage of plastic bags throughout the state.

The court mandates that commercial establishments must treat sewage and industrial effluents before discharging them into the River Ganga. Drains opening into the river must be sealed and closed within three months. The most polluting units on the river banks must be relocated according to established norms. Littering, defecating, and urinating within 500 meters of the river are prohibited, with fines and imprisonment imposed for violations. Plastic carry bags are banned throughout the state, and people are encouraged to use paper or jute bags.

Soap, oil, and shampoo use while bathing in the river are prohibited, as is bathing cattle in the river. Begging is prohibited in all holy places in Uttarakhand. Skimmers must be provided to clean the river, and treatment plants must be set up to dispose of garbage. No new industries based on water are permitted within two kilometers of the river banks, and no new commercial establishments employing more than 50 people can operate without setting up an effluent or sewage treatment plant.

The court recommends that the Union of India frame a law exclusively for River Ganga to save it from extinction. The State Government should declare "River Conservation Zones" where no construction activity should be permitted on the banks of the river. The Comptroller and Auditor General is directed to conduct a special audit of all the Centrally Financed Schemes launched to rejuvenate river Ganga as well as the amount spent by the State Governments for rejuvenation of river Ganga.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the urgent need to address the pollution of the Ganga river and protect the rights of riparian states to access clean water. The court emphasizes the importance of enforcing laws related to environmental protection and the role of the court in ensuring that the government takes effective steps to enforce these laws. The court also recommends various measures to address the pollution of the river, including the establishment of sewage treatment plants, the closure of polluting industries, and the prohibition of littering and plastic bags. The court's order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and natural resources and ensuring sustainable development.
