The court order pertains to a case where a resident of Peringome - Vayakkara Grama Panchayat in Kannur District has challenged the installation of a mobile telephone tower by Reliance Info-com Ltd. in K.P.Nagar, a thickly populated area in Peringome. The petitioner has argued that the emission of electro-magnetic radiation from the mobile telephone towers would result in health hazards and environmental hazards to the people around. The petitioner seeks to quash the order granting permission to the third respondent to install the tower and to direct the respondents to shift the mobile phone tower to a non-residential area. The third respondent claims to have a license from the Government of India to provide basic telephone services in Kerala.

The court has examined the arguments put forth by both parties and has cited previous judgments and documents to support the telecom company's position. The court has noted that the company has obtained all necessary licenses and permissions, and that there are no restrictions on the construction of telecom towers except near defense areas or railway establishments. The court has also found that a previous case (LT 695) has already decided against the petitioner's argument. The court has dismissed the writ petition and has not issued any directions for the tower to be located in another area. There will be no order as to costs.

The court has also addressed the issue of the Ombudsman for mobile phone service providers insisting on a no objection certificate from the Atomic Energy Commission before installing mobile towers. The court has found this insistence to be unwarranted and has dismissed the petitioner's argument on this point as well.

The court's decision is based on a careful examination of the facts and the law. The court has taken into account the concerns raised by the petitioner regarding the health and environmental hazards of mobile telephone towers. However, the court has also noted that the telecom company has obtained all necessary licenses and permissions, and that there are no restrictions on the construction of telecom towers except near defense areas or railway establishments. The court has also cited previous judgments and documents to support the company's position. 

In conclusion, the court has dismissed the writ petition and has not issued any directions for the tower to be located in another area. The court has also found the insistence of the Ombudsman for mobile phone service providers to produce a no objection certificate from the Atomic Energy Commission before installing mobile towers to be unwarranted. The court's decision is based on a careful examination of the facts and the law, and takes into account the concerns raised by the petitioner regarding the health and environmental hazards of mobile telephone towers.
