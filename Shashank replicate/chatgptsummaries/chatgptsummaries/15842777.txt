The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by Ram Ji Vyas in the public interest. The petitioner sought to restrain the State of Rajasthan from de-notifying the Beriganga Forest Block and to declare it as forest land. The petitioner also sought to stop illegal mining in the reserved forest area and nearby water bodies.

The respondents submitted that the matter of de-notifying the forest land had been referred to the Central Government, and no lease or license had been granted for mining in the area since 2004. The court directed the respondents to ensure that no mining takes place in the forest area and the catchment area of the Balsamand Lake.

The court also held that the conversion and construction permission in and around the lakes and their respective catchment areas is completely banned, except in rare exceptional cases. This order is significant as it seeks to protect the environment and natural resources of the state.

The Beriganga Forest Block is a reserved forest area in Rajasthan, which is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The area is also a catchment area for the Balsamand Lake, which is a major source of water for the city of Jodhpur.
