The court has rejected the second bail application of Nathhan Singh, who was apprehending his arrest for offences under various acts related to wildlife protection and forest laws. The applicant's counsel argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and should be granted anticipatory bail. However, the court refused to grant bail as the offence was registered in 2001, and the applicant had not surrendered to custody for four years. The court also noted that the applicant's first bail application was rejected two and a half years ago.

Nathhan Singh was accused of violating various acts related to wildlife protection and forest laws. He had been apprehending his arrest and had filed a second bail application. His counsel argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and should be granted anticipatory bail. However, the court rejected his application, citing the fact that the offence was registered in 2001 and that the applicant had not surrendered to custody for four years.

The court also noted that the applicant's first bail application was rejected two and a half years ago. This suggests that the court had already considered the applicant's case and had found no grounds for granting bail. The fact that the applicant had not surrendered to custody for four years further weakened his case.

The court's decision to reject the bail application is in line with the principles of justice. The court has a duty to ensure that those accused of crimes are brought to justice. In this case, the court has found that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Nathhan Singh has violated various acts related to wildlife protection and forest laws. The fact that he had not surrendered to custody for four years suggests that he was trying to evade justice.

The court's decision also sends a strong message to others who may be tempted to violate wildlife protection and forest laws. The court has made it clear that such offences will not be taken lightly and that those who violate these laws will be brought to justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Nathhan Singh's bail application is a just one. The court has considered all the relevant factors and has found that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that he has violated various acts related to wildlife protection and forest laws. The fact that he had not surrendered to custody for four years further weakened his case. The court's decision sends a strong message to others who may be tempted to violate these laws. It is important that we protect our wildlife and forests, and those who violate these laws must be brought to justice.
