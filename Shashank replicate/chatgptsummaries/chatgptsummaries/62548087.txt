The court order pertains to a case where M/s Electrotherm (India) Ltd. appealed against a judgment passed by the High Court of Gujarat, which had set aside the Environmental Clearance granted to the company and directed them to stop operations until they received fresh clearance. The court order provides details of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and the requirements for obtaining Environmental Clearance. It also outlines the history of the company's plant and the process of obtaining clearance for expansion. Ultimately, the court order confirms the grant of Environmental Clearance to the company for the expansion of their steel plant.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests granted permission for the expansion of a steel plant in Gujarat by Electrotherm India Limited. The expansion would take place within the existing industrial premises, and no national park, wildlife sanctuary, or reserve forest was located within a 10 km radius of the project site. However, the High Court of Gujarat later revoked the Environmental Clearance granted to the company for expansion, citing a lack of public consultation or public hearing, which was a mandatory requirement under the 2006 Notification. The court ordered the company to stop operations of the entire plant and directed that operations could only be restarted after fresh Environmental Clearance was accorded in its favor by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Union of India. The matter is presently under challenge in the Supreme Court.

The court order directs the Central Pollution Control Board and Gujarat Pollution Control Board to conduct a joint inspection of the petitioner's project and report on compliance with recommendations by July 5, 2014. If the petitioner has not complied, the special leave petition will be dismissed, but if compliance is found, the impugned order of the High Court will be set aside. The court finds that public consultation/public hearing is a mandatory requirement for Environmental Clearance and that the decision-making process in granting exemption from public consultation/public hearing was invalid and improper. The court orders that the matter be relegated back to the concerned authorities to effectuate public consultation/public hearing and change the nature of the requirement from pre-decisional to post-decisional. The public consultation/public hearing shall be organized by the concerned authorities in three months from the date of the order.
