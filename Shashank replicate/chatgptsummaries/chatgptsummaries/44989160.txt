The Tihar Jail in Delhi is one of the largest prisons in India, housing thousands of inmates. Over the years, the jail has been the site of numerous incidents of violence and corruption, leading to several court cases. In this article, we will summarize four court orders related to incidents in Tihar Jail.

The first court order pertains to a case where the accused, Prakash, was charged under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code for causing injury to a fellow inmate in Tihar Jail. The prosecution alleged that Prakash, along with two other convicts, had assaulted the victim with a danda (stick) after he refused to pay them money for providing him with a special diet. The defense argued that the injury caused did not amount to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as required under Section 308, and that there was no corroborative evidence against the accused. After examining the evidence and arguments, the court acquitted the accused of the charges.

The second court order describes the testimony of several witnesses regarding an incident in which an inmate in Jail No. 2 allegedly demanded money from another inmate in exchange for special dietary privileges. The accused and an assistant superintendent of the jail were said to have harassed and threatened the victim, who eventually filed a complaint with the jail superintendent. The victim was later assaulted by the accused with a stick, causing injuries that required medical treatment. The court heard testimony from jail officials, medical personnel, and police officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of the case.

The third court order pertains to a case involving a scuffle between two inmates in Tihar Jail, and allegations of corruption against Assistant Superintendent Kartar Singh. The court heard testimony from various witnesses, including prison officials and police personnel involved in the investigation. There were some minor contradictions in their testimony, but the court held that these did not undermine the core of the case. The court also noted that the testimony of police officials should be given the same weight as that of other witnesses. Ultimately, the court found the accused guilty of causing hurt to the other inmate and sentenced him accordingly.

The fourth court order discusses the case of State vs. Prakash, where the accused was charged with assaulting the complainant, Surender Grover, with a danda. The court found that the complainant and accused were both in judicial custody as convicts, and that the complainant had a history of filing false complaints. The court also found that the allegation of assault was false and that only a minor scuffle had taken place between the two convicts. The accused was found guilty of the offense under section 323 IPC, but not under section 308 IPC.

In all four court orders, the incidents took place within the confines of Tihar Jail, highlighting the need for better management and oversight of the prison system in India. The court orders also demonstrate the importance of a fair and impartial judicial system, where evidence is examined carefully and justice is served.
