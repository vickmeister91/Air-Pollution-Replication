The court has granted regular bail to Sureshkumar Natthuram Valmiki and another person in connection with an offense under the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The court has ordered them to execute a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each and to follow certain conditions, including surrendering their passport and not leaving the state of Gujarat without prior permission. The court has also warned that if they breach any of the conditions, appropriate action will be taken.

The Gujarat Prohibition Act was enacted in 1949 to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Gujarat. The act has been amended several times over the years to strengthen its provisions and increase penalties for violations.

Sureshkumar Natthuram Valmiki and another person were arrested for violating the provisions of the Gujarat Prohibition Act. They were accused of manufacturing and selling illicit liquor in the state. The police had conducted a raid on their premises and seized a large quantity of illicit liquor and equipment used for its manufacture.

The accused were produced before the court, which remanded them to judicial custody. They subsequently applied for bail, which was opposed by the prosecution on the grounds that they were likely to abscond and tamper with evidence if released on bail.

The court considered the arguments of both sides and granted bail to the accused. However, the court imposed certain conditions on them to ensure that they do not abscond or tamper with evidence. The accused were ordered to execute a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each and to surrender their passport to the court. They were also ordered not to leave the state of Gujarat without prior permission from the court.

The court warned the accused that if they breach any of the conditions, appropriate action will be taken against them. The court also directed them to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings.

The granting of bail to the accused has been welcomed by their supporters, who have been protesting against their arrest. They have argued that the accused are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case. They have also criticized the police for their handling of the case and alleged that they have been harassing the accused.

The case has highlighted the issue of illicit liquor in the state of Gujarat, which has been a major problem for many years. The state government has taken several measures to curb the manufacture and sale of illicit liquor, including increasing penalties for violations and launching awareness campaigns.

However, the problem persists, and many people continue to consume illicit liquor due to its low cost and easy availability. The consumption of illicit liquor has led to several deaths and health problems in the state, and there is a need for more effective measures to tackle the problem.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sureshkumar Natthuram Valmiki and another person in connection with an offense under the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The court has imposed certain conditions on them to ensure that they do not abscond or tamper with evidence. The case has highlighted the issue of illicit liquor in the state of Gujarat, and there is a need for more effective measures to tackle the problem.
