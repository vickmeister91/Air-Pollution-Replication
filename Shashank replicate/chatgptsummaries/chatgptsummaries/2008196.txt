The court has recently issued three orders related to the transportation of iron ore purchased from Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd. by Jindal Steel and Power Ltd. (JSPL) in the state of Odisha. The first order pertains to a writ application filed by JSPL seeking permission to transport iron ore purchased from Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd. The State of Odisha had granted permission to purchase the ore in 2004, and the company had paid all taxes and royalties. However, in 2014, the Deputy Director of Mines called upon the company to stop transportation of ore, and subsequent representations seeking permission were rejected. The court examined the facts and found that the company had followed due process and had all necessary clearances and permits. The court directed the State to grant permission for transportation of the ore.

The second order pertains to a dispute between M/S JSPL and the State Government regarding the transportation of processed iron ore from the leasehold area of Sarda Mines Pvt. Ltd. The State Government had rejected M/S JSPL's request for permission to transport the ore, citing legal provisions that prohibit transportation without valid statutory clearances. M/S JSPL argued that transportation of the procured and processed minerals by the petitioners who possess the necessary license under the OMPTS Rules and who have purchased the RoM from the mining lessee is permissible under law. The court considered various legal provisions and judgments and ultimately allowed M/S JSPL's petition, stating that transportation of the ore did not come under the purview of "mining operations/activities."

The third order pertains to a dispute over the transportation of iron ore from a mining leasehold area to a pelletisation plant. The court examined the terms of the agreement between the parties and concluded that the petitioners had a valid contract for the purchase of ore with the leaseholder. The court also held that the definition of "mining operation" under the Mines Act, 1952 was not applicable to the present case. The court quashed the orders directing stoppage of transportation of ore and granted permission to the petitioners to transport the entire processed ore.

In all three cases, the court examined the legal provisions and judgments related to the transportation of minerals and concluded that the petitioners had followed due process and had all necessary clearances and permits. The court also held that transportation of the ore did not come under the purview of "mining operations/activities" and therefore, the State Government could not prohibit the transportation of the ore. The court directed the State Government to grant permission for transportation of the ore and quashed the orders directing stoppage of transportation of ore.

These orders are significant as they provide clarity on the legal provisions related to the transportation of minerals and the role of the State Government in granting permission for transportation. The orders also highlight the importance of following due process and obtaining all necessary clearances and permits before transporting minerals. The orders are likely to have a positive impact on the mining industry in the state of Odisha and provide a boost to the economy.
