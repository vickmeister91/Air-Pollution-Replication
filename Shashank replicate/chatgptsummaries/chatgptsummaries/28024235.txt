The Telangana High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of writ petitions challenging the validity of the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of Teachers) Rules, 2018. The petitioners were teachers working in government schools or schools under the control of local bodies who were aggrieved by the action of the State Government in effecting transfers and prescribing the Rules for effecting transfers of Headmasters, teachers, etc.

The court examined the scope of judicial review in matters relating to transfers and concluded that unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafides or is made in violation of any operative guidelines or Rules, Courts should not interfere with the administrative authority's decision. The court stated that unless a transfer order is made in violation of guidelines or rules, or is a result of malafide exercise of power, courts should not interfere with it. Government servants or employees of local bodies have no legal right to insist on being posted at a particular place, and transfer orders are a normal incidence of service.

The court also discussed the 2018 Rules related to transfers of teachers in Telangana and examined whether they violate the order of status quo passed by the court. The court concluded that the impugned Rules do not violate the interim order passed by the court. The court stated that the State Government is allowed to transfer management of teachers without integrating them or disturbing their seniority or promotions. The court had previously issued an interim order of status-quo, which disabled the State Government from integrating teachers in Government Schools and local body schools.

The court order also clarifies that the 2018 Rules stipulate that all transfers shall be effected within the present management, and that the distinction between local body schools and Government schools is maintained. The court order also clarifies that the amendment made to the Presidential Order in 2017 has not been rendered illegal by the order of status-quo. The court stated that a suspension of an order does not wipe it out from existence, but only holds it in abeyance. The order of status quo passed by the court only disables the government from implementing the amended Presidential Order, but does not wipe it out from existence.

The court also discussed the ambiguity surrounding the Presidential Order and its application to teachers in local body schools. The court concluded that the Presidential Order only requires a local cadre to be organized for civil posts in departments of the State Government, and not for posts under a local authority. Therefore, teachers in local body schools were not organized into a local cadre, while teachers in government schools were. Each district is a separate unit for the purposes of recruitment, appointment, discharge, seniority, promotion, and transfer of teachers.

The court order states that the 1975 Presidential Order recognizes only the erstwhile 10 districts in the present State of Telangana as the district within which a local cadre is required to be organized and be treated as a unit. The creation of 31 districts, with effect from 11.10.2016, has no bearing on local area reservation to be provided in terms of the Presidential Order. The court also mentions that the 2018 Rules fall foul of the law declared in the Division Bench judgments of this Court in M.Kesavulu and P.Vema Reddy. The court concludes that the unit of appointment, transfer, seniority, promotion, etc. of teachers in local body schools would have continued to be the erstwhile ten districts in the State of Telangana.

The court order states that the seniority, promotion, and transfer of teachers in local body schools in Telangana will continue to be based on the erstwhile ten districts, as prescribed in the 1975 Presidential Order. The State Government has chosen to prescribe the erstwhile ten districts as a unit for transfer also, which is not irrational and does not violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court also states that the burden is on the party attacking the categorization to prove that it is so unreasonable as to violate Article 14 of the Constitution.

The court discussed the burden of proof in challenging categorization or prescription, stating that the party attacking the categorization must show that it is unreasonable and violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The court also discussed the requirement of laying rules before both houses of the legislature, stating that the rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution are legislative in character and cannot be struck down unless they violate Part III or any other provisions of the Constitution. The court concludes that non-compliance with the laying clause does not affect the validity of the rules and their coming into force.

The court order states that the omission to comply with the requirement of laying the Rules before the State Legislature would not affect the validity of the Rules and their coming into force. The laying of the Rules before the legislature is merely directory and not mandatory. The court also dismisses the contention that Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules is a colourable legislation. The intent behind the prescription of the ten districts as a unit of transfer is to integrate teachers working in government schools and local body schools into one common cadre. The court concludes that the 2018 Rules are not liable to be struck down for procedural violation of Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act, 1982.

The court discussed the concept of "colourable legislation" where the legislature may try to exceed its power in an indirect or disguised manner.
