The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Jacob Rajan, a pastor practicing Christianity, against the District Collector and other officials in Coimbatore District. The petitioner had been conducting prayer meetings at his residence after obtaining plan approval from the District Municipality. However, the respondents had asked him to obtain permission for conducting such meetings, which the petitioner challenged as a violation of his fundamental rights. During an earlier hearing, the court had asked the petitioner to produce a copy of the required approval or apply for it if not obtained yet. The current order does not provide any new information or ruling.

The court order requires the petitioner to provide details about the status of their public worship premises and explain why certain requirements may not be applicable. The court cites a previous case where it was determined that the use of loudspeakers and drums for public worship should not adversely affect the rights of others. The court also emphasizes the importance of enforcing rules and regulations regarding noise pollution. The court acknowledges the fundamental right to freedom of religion but notes that it is subject to public order, morality, and health.

The court order states that while conducting public worship in residential premises, the petitioner must ensure that no hindrance or disturbance is caused to the general public. The concerned authorities have the right to take necessary action under relevant statutes in case of any nuisance being caused due to noise pollution or violation of statutory provisions. The conduct of public worship causing disturbance to the neighborhood cannot be permitted, especially when it is found that it would not be possible to grant permission under the relevant rules. The writ petition is dismissed, and the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. No costs are awarded.
