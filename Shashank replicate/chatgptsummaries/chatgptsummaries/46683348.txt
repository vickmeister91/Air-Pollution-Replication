The case at hand involves a petition filed by M/S Balaji Stone Crusher to quash an order revoking the No Objection Certificate (NOC) issued by the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had been granted a lease for mining stone boulders, which was renewed for ten years with a condition to submit an NOC from the Pollution Control Board. However, the NOC was revoked because the petitioner did not receive approval of the mining plan required under the provisions of the M.P. Pollution Control Act.

The petitioner argued that the approval for the mining plan as a pre-condition for the grant of NOC is not necessary in accordance with the provisions of amended Rule 18 (2) of the M.P. Minor Minerals Rules, 1996. However, the Pollution Control Board argued that a prior permission for the mining plan is necessary in view of the notification issued by the Central Government in exercise of powers conferred under the provisions of Environmental (Protection) Act 1986.

The court referred to the relevant rules and notifications and concluded that the NOC was rightly revoked as the petitioner did not obtain prior environmental clearance for mining of minerals. The court order states that prior environmental clearance is required for mining leases with an area of more than 5 hectares, and for renewals of mining leases. The Ministry of Environment and Forest has constituted a committee for this purpose.

The court has not made any decision on the merits of the case and no costs have been awarded. However, the petitioner must obtain environmental clearance before operating the mine, and the respondent No.4 Authority must pass an appropriate order on the petitioner's application for environmental clearance within six weeks. The M.P. Pollution Control Board must consider the request for grant of NOC within two weeks of the order.

In summary, the court has upheld the revocation of the NOC issued to M/S Balaji Stone Crusher due to the petitioner's failure to obtain prior environmental clearance for mining of minerals. The court has emphasized the importance of obtaining environmental clearance for mining leases with an area of more than 5 hectares, and for renewals of mining leases. The petitioner has been given a deadline of six weeks to obtain environmental clearance, and the Pollution Control Board has been given a deadline of two weeks to consider the request for grant of NOC.
