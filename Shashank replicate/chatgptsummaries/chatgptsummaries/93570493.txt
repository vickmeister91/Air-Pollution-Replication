The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in an appeal filed by the Revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 against the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax quashing the penalty imposed on JKD Capital and Finlease Limited under Section 271-E of the Act. The ITAT had earlier affirmed the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty on the ground that the penalty order could have only been passed on or before 30th June 2008 and therefore, the penalty order passed on 20th March 2012 was barred by limitation. The court held that the order of the CIT (A) does not suffer from any legal infirmity and dismissed the appeal.

The case pertains to the imposition of penalty under Section 271-E of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on JKD Capital and Finlease Limited. The penalty was imposed on the ground that the company had failed to comply with the provisions of Section 269SS of the Act, which requires that no person shall take or accept any loan or deposit in cash exceeding Rs. 20,000. The penalty was imposed for the assessment year 2007-08.

The company had challenged the imposition of penalty before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who had quashed the penalty on the ground that the penalty order could have only been passed on or before 30th June 2008 and therefore, the penalty order passed on 20th March 2012 was barred by limitation. The Revenue had challenged this order before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), which had affirmed the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty.

The Revenue had then filed an appeal before the Delhi High Court under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The court noted that the issue before it was whether the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty was correct in law. The court observed that the CIT (A) had held that the penalty order was barred by limitation as it was passed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 275(1)(a) of the Act.

The court noted that Section 275(1)(a) of the Act provides that no order imposing a penalty shall be passed after the expiry of six months from the end of the financial year in which the proceedings, in the course of which the penalty is proposed to be imposed, are completed. The court observed that the proceedings in the present case were completed on 31st March 2009 and therefore, the penalty order could have been passed on or before 30th September 2009.

The court noted that the penalty order in the present case was passed on 20th March 2012, which was beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 275(1)(a) of the Act. The court observed that the ITAT had rightly held that the penalty order was barred by limitation and that the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty did not suffer from any legal infirmity.

The court also noted that the Revenue had not been able to point out any error in the order of the CIT (A) or the ITAT. The court observed that the Revenue had merely contended that the penalty order was not barred by limitation and that the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty was incorrect. The court held that this contention was without merit and dismissed the appeal.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court has upheld the order of the CIT (A) deleting the penalty imposed on JKD Capital and Finlease Limited under Section 271-E of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The court has held that the penalty order was barred by limitation and that the order of the CIT (A) does not suffer from any legal infirmity. The judgment is significant as it reaffirms the importance of complying with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the consequences of non-compliance.
