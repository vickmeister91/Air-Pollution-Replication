The Madras High Court recently received three separate writ petitions, all related to allegations of forgery and misconduct in obtaining consent orders for running crusher units. The first petition was filed by G. Chinnaraju, who requested a Writ of Mandamus to direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to cancel the consent order issued in favor of M/s.J.R.S.Crusher. Chinnaraju claimed that the respondents forged his signature and transferred the Blue Metal Crushing Unit to M/s.J.R.S.Crusher. The court ordered respondents 6 to 8 to be impleaded and set a hearing date.

The second petition pertains to a case where the petitioner alleges that respondents 3 to 5 forged their signature to obtain a consent order from the second respondent for running a crusher unit. The petitioner made representations to the first respondent for cancellation of the alleged consent order, but no action was taken. The court has directed respondents 1 and 2 to consider the representations, conduct an enquiry, and pass appropriate orders within two months. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the claim made by the petitioner.

The third petition does not provide any details about the court order, except for the case number, date, and names of the judges. However, it is likely related to the same issue of alleged forgery and misconduct in obtaining consent orders for running crusher units.

These writ petitions highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in the process of obtaining consent orders for running crusher units. The allegations of forgery and misconduct raise serious concerns about the integrity of the process and the potential for environmental harm. It is essential that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board takes these allegations seriously and conducts a thorough investigation to ensure that the consent orders are issued only to those who meet the necessary criteria and comply with the environmental regulations.

The court's decision to implead respondents 6 to 8 in the first petition and direct respondents 1 and 2 to conduct an enquiry in the second petition is a positive step towards ensuring accountability and transparency in the process. It is important that the court continues to monitor these cases and takes appropriate action to address any wrongdoing.

In conclusion, the writ petitions filed in the Madras High Court highlight the need for transparency and accountability in the process of obtaining consent orders for running crusher units. The allegations of forgery and misconduct raise serious concerns about the integrity of the process and the potential for environmental harm. It is essential that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board takes these allegations seriously and conducts a thorough investigation to ensure that the consent orders are issued only to those who meet the necessary criteria and comply with the environmental regulations. The court's decision to implead respondents and direct an enquiry is a positive step towards ensuring accountability and transparency in the process.
