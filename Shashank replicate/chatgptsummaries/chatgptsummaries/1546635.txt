The Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Limited filed a writ petition challenging the assessment orders made under Section 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The petitioner argued that as the sugar industry is not covered by the Cess Act, no cess was payable. The court examined the definition of "specified industry" and "vegetable" in Schedule I of the Act and considered the legislative purpose and context of the provisions of the Act while interpreting the same. The court held that the sugar industry is covered by the Cess Act as it falls under the processing of vegetable products industry.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the word "vegetable" in the context of the Cess Act and Pollution Act. The Pollution Act aims to prevent and control water pollution, and the Cess Act provides finances for the State Boards to carry out their duties. The court concludes that the sugar industry falls under Entry 15 of Schedule II of the Cess Act, which covers industries processing animal and vegetable products. The court rejects the writ petition and refuses the oral prayer for leave to the Supreme Court.

The case of Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others dealt with the interpretation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 and whether the sugar industry was liable to pay cess under the Act. The petitioner, Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Limited, argued that as the sugar industry was not covered by the Cess Act, no cess was payable. The State of Uttar Pradesh and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) argued that the sugar industry was covered by the Act and was liable to pay cess.

The court examined the definition of "specified industry" and "vegetable" in Schedule I of the Act and considered the legislative purpose and context of the provisions of the Act while interpreting the same. The court noted that the Pollution Act aims to prevent and control water pollution, and the Cess Act provides finances for the State Boards to carry out their duties. The court also noted that the Cess Act was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by certain industries and for the purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court observed that the definition of "specified industry" in Schedule I of the Cess Act includes "any industry specified in Schedule II". The court then examined Entry 15 of Schedule II, which covers "industries engaged in the processing of animal and vegetable products". The court noted that the sugar industry involves the processing of sugarcane, which is a vegetable product. The court also noted that the definition of "vegetable" in Schedule I of the Act includes "sugarcane".

The court held that the sugar industry is covered by the Cess Act as it falls under the processing of vegetable products industry. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the sugar industry was not covered by the Act and held that the petitioner was liable to pay cess under the Act. The court also refused the oral prayer for leave to the Supreme Court.

The court's interpretation of the Cess Act and its application to the sugar industry is significant as it clarifies the liability of the sugar industry to pay cess under the Act. The court's interpretation of the word "vegetable" in the context of the Act is also significant as it provides guidance on the interpretation of the Act and its provisions.
