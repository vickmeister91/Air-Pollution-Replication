On October 23, 2017, the Kerala High Court issued an order regarding the petitioner's application for consent to operate an industrial unit. The court ordered the second respondent to make a decision on the application within one month from the date of receipt of the court's judgment.

The court heard arguments from both the petitioner's counsel and the government pleader before making the decision. The petitioner's counsel likely argued that the application should be approved, while the government pleader may have argued that it should be denied.

It is unclear from the court order what the specific details of the application were, such as the type of industrial unit or its location. However, it is clear that the petitioner was seeking consent to operate the unit.

The court's decision to order the second respondent to make a decision within one month suggests that the application had been pending for some time. The court likely felt that it was important to resolve the matter quickly, either to allow the petitioner to begin operating the unit or to prevent them from doing so.

It is also unclear from the court order what the potential environmental or social impacts of the industrial unit may be. However, it is possible that these factors were considered by the court in making its decision.

Overall, the Kerala High Court's order highlights the importance of timely decision-making in matters related to industrial operations. It also underscores the need to balance economic development with environmental and social concerns.
