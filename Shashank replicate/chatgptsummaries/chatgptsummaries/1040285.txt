The petitioner, Sajin @ Sachin, had been accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The court order granting him bail is subject to certain conditions. The petitioner is required to execute a bond for Rs. 15,000 with two solvent sureties. This is a standard requirement for bail, and ensures that the petitioner will appear in court when required. The petitioner is also required to report before the Investigating Officer every Wednesday. This is to ensure that the petitioner remains available for interrogation and investigation.

The court order also prohibits the petitioner from influencing or intimidating prosecution witnesses. This is an important condition, as it ensures that the witnesses are able to testify freely and without fear of retaliation. Additionally, the petitioner is not allowed to commit any offense while on bail. This condition is also standard, and ensures that the petitioner does not engage in any criminal activity while awaiting trial.

The court order warns that if the petitioner breaches any of these conditions, his bail will be cancelled. This means that if the petitioner fails to comply with any of the conditions set forth in the order, he will be taken back into custody. This is a serious consequence, and serves as a deterrent to the petitioner to comply with the conditions of his bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to the petitioner, Sajin @ Sachin, who is the sole accused in a case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The order directs that the petitioner be released on bail from January 17, 2011, on the condition that he executes a bond for Rs. 15,000 with two solvent sureties. Additionally, the petitioner is required to report before the Investigating Officer every Wednesday, make himself available for interrogation, not influence or intimidate prosecution witnesses, and not commit any offense while on bail.
