The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jhakki @ Heeralla Adivasi and four others under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for the offence of hunting a leopard, punishable under sections 2, 9, 39 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The applicants had been in custody since 17/07/2018 and their counsel argued that they were innocent and that there was no likelihood of them absconding or tampering with evidence.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court allowed the bail application and ordered the release of the applicants on a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order remains effective till the end of the trial but becomes ineffective in case of bail jump.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

The offence of hunting a leopard is a serious one and is punishable under sections 2, 9, 39 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Section 2 of the Act defines hunting as capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring, or trapping any wild animal, and includes any attempt to do so. Section 9 of the Act provides for the prohibition of hunting in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. Section 39 of the Act provides for the punishment for hunting, while section 51 provides for the punishment for offences committed by companies.

In this case, the court had to consider whether the applicants were entitled to bail. The right to bail is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court has held that the grant of bail is the rule and its refusal is the exception. The court has to consider various factors while deciding a bail application, such as the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence, and the possibility of the accused influencing witnesses.

In this case, the court considered the arguments of both sides and found that the applicants were entitled to bail. The court noted that the applicants had been in custody for a considerable period and that there was no likelihood of them absconding or tampering with evidence. The court also noted that the offence in question was not a heinous one and that the applicants were not likely to influence witnesses.

The court, therefore, allowed the bail application and ordered the release of the applicants on a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order remains effective till the end of the trial but becomes ineffective in case of bail jump.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jhakki @ Heeralla Adivasi and four others under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for the offence of hunting a leopard, punishable under sections 2, 9, 39 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the release of the applicants on a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order remains effective till the end of the trial but becomes ineffective in case of bail jump. The court considered various factors while deciding the bail application and found that the applicants were entitled to bail. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.
