The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of water pollution in various canals and water bodies in the state of Rajasthan, India. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Gyan Kaur and others against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court order was passed on 29th September 2016.

The second court order discusses a case regarding pollution in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal and Ganga Nahar itself. The court directs the State to come up with short and long term plans to render the canal and its distributories free of encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board is directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court also imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating the water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The court orders the State/local authorities to impose the compensation or damages and to place before them the action taken report in respect of enforcement of the direction. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the despatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009 to them before the next date of hearing. The case is listed for further hearing on various dates, and the State is directed to submit the long term and short term scheme as well as a report on the action taken. The court also directs the District Collector, Ganga Nagar to be present with all the relevant records on the next date of hearing.

The third court order discusses the failure of the State of Rajasthan to comply with previous directions to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The court directs the State to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those contributing to pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court also orders the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal and for the State to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies.

The fourth court order pertains to a case of pollution in the Indira Gandhi Canal in Rajasthan. The State Government was directed to issue notices to those contributing to the pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000 from them, which would be deposited in the Environment Relief Fund. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the notices issued and ordered compliance with its directions. The court also directed the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and ordered a compliance report. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental issues. The court also discussed the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The final court order explains that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court has the discretion to insist upon a party to avail alternative remedy if that is efficacious. The court also notes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, and a writ court should be extremely slow in entertaining any issue which is under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The writ petition is dismissed accordingly, with the liberty to the petitioner(s) to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015.
