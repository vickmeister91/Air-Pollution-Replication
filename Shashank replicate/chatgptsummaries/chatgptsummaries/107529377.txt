The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai recently heard an appeal by M/s. Brakes India Ltd. against an order by the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), Chennai. The appellant argued that their plantation should not be considered a gardening service, as it was required by pollution control agencies to maintain a green belt area. The tribunal agreed and allowed the appeal, citing a previous case that stated taxable services availed to adhere to eco-friendly requirements should not disentitle the recipient of such service to the CENVAT credit.

The case in question involved M/s. Brakes India Ltd., a company engaged in the manufacture of automotive components. The company had set up a plantation on its factory premises as part of its efforts to maintain a green belt area, which was required by pollution control agencies. The company had availed the services of a contractor for the maintenance of the plantation, which included activities such as watering, pruning, and weeding.

The Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), Chennai had earlier held that the services provided by the contractor to M/s. Brakes India Ltd. amounted to gardening services, which were taxable under the Finance Act, 1994. The Commissioner had also disallowed the CENVAT credit claimed by the company on the service tax paid on these services.

M/s. Brakes India Ltd. appealed against this order before the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai. The company argued that the plantation was not a garden, but a green belt area that was required by pollution control agencies. The company also contended that the services provided by the contractor were not taxable, as they were availed to adhere to eco-friendly requirements.

The tribunal agreed with M/s. Brakes India Ltd. and allowed the appeal. The tribunal held that the plantation was not a garden, but a green belt area that was required by pollution control agencies. The tribunal also cited a previous case, namely, the case of CCE, Jaipur-I v. Rajasthan Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd., where it was held that taxable services availed to adhere to eco-friendly requirements should not disentitle the recipient of such service to the CENVAT credit.

The tribunal observed that the services provided by the contractor to M/s. Brakes India Ltd. were availed to maintain a green belt area, which was required by pollution control agencies. The tribunal held that such services were not taxable, as they were availed to adhere to eco-friendly requirements. The tribunal also allowed the CENVAT credit claimed by the company on the service tax paid on these services.

In conclusion, the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai has held that services availed to maintain a green belt area, which is required by pollution control agencies, should not be considered taxable under the Finance Act, 1994. The tribunal has also held that the recipient of such services should be entitled to the CENVAT credit on the service tax paid on these services. This decision is in line with the government's efforts to promote eco-friendly practices and encourage companies to take steps to protect the environment.
