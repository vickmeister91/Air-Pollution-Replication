In two separate court orders, Ramesh Kumar @ Raj Ramesh was acquitted of charges related to giving false information to the police regarding the theft of his car. The first complaint was lodged by the accused in 2003, and the investigation was closed when the vehicle could not be traced. In 2004, the accused was arrested after making a disclosure statement that he had lodged a false complaint. However, the court found no evidence to support this claim and acquitted him of the charge.

The second court order stated that the accused had made a false complaint about the theft of his car, which was later found to be financed by Citi Bank. The investigation failed to prove that the accused had given false information to the police, and the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused. The accused was acquitted of the offense under section 182 IPC. The court also criticized the IO for falsely implicating the accused and causing him to undergo criminal proceedings for almost 10 years.

In both cases, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused had given false information to the police. The court found no evidence to support the claim that the accused had reason to believe that the information was false at the time of giving it to the public servant. The court also criticized the IO for falsely implicating the accused and causing him to undergo criminal proceedings for almost a decade.

The court's decision to acquit the accused in both cases was based on the lack of evidence to support the prosecution's case. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had given false information to the police and that the accused had reason to believe that the information was false at the time of giving it to the public servant.

The court's criticism of the IO for falsely implicating the accused and causing him to undergo criminal proceedings for almost 10 years highlights the importance of conducting thorough investigations and ensuring that the accused is not falsely implicated. False accusations can have serious consequences for the accused, including loss of reputation, financial hardship, and even imprisonment.
