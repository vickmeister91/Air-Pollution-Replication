The court order pertains to a lawsuit filed by M/S. P.P. Jewellers Pvt. Ltd against the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for violation of outdoor advertisement policies. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the defendants were not entitled to recover a certain amount of money and a permanent injunction against the defendants from proceeding with certain notices/letters of demand and obstructing the plaintiff's self-signage. The defendants objected to the suit on the grounds that the plaintiff did not serve a statutory notice as required by the DMC Act. The defendants also claimed that the suit was not signed, verified, or filed by a duly authorized person.

The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and found that the plaintiff did not serve a notice before filing the suit. However, the court also found that the nature of the suit was such that the object would be defeated by giving notice or postponing the institution of the suit. The court emphasized public safety and declared that the issue of levying taxes or imposts was not the subject matter of the controversy. The court held that the circular framed by the MCD for charging, computing, and recovering such impost was without authority of law. The court also held that a taxing provision cannot be inferred by implication and must be expressed unambiguously.

The court further held that a company can sue and be sued in its own name, and a pleading on behalf of a company can be signed and verified by its director. The court found that the bar provided under Section-478 DMC Act would not operate in this case. The plaintiff did not pray for any relief of mandatory injunction, but only for permanent injunction. The court allowed the plaintiff's application to correct a typographical mistake in the issues written in the proceeding sheet.

The plaintiff sought a declaration and injunction in respect of two notices issued by the defendants, both based on a circular issued by defendant no.1. The circular was challenged in another case, and the court found that the impugned charges were not imposed pursuant to or in exercise of any statutory power under the DMC Act. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff and granted the relief sought. The defendants are not entitled to recover the mentioned amount and are restrained from proceeding with the notices/communications/letters of demand issued by them. The plaintiff is allowed to display self-signage on the premises in question. The decree sheet will be prepared accordingly.
