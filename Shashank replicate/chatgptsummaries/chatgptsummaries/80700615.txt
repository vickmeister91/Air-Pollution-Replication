The court order pertains to a case involving several accused persons who were allegedly involved in the illegal trade of wild animal skins and derivatives. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had taken over the investigation of the case from the Chief Wildlife Warden and had filed supplementary complaints against some of the accused persons. The accused persons sought discharge on the grounds that the CBI had no power to conduct further investigation in a complaint case under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the 'charge-sheet' mentioned in Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA did not include complaint cases. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision.

The court order discusses the issue of whether the CBI has the power to conduct further investigation after a report has been forwarded to the Magistrate under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. The court examines relevant provisions of law and previous cases and ultimately concludes that the CBI does have the power to conduct further investigation in certain circumstances. The court clarifies that a magistrate has the power to direct further investigation after the filing of a police report but does not have the power to order a reinvestigation or fresh investigation. The court also explains the different types of reports that can be filed by an investigating agency, including the FIR, further report, and final report. The court emphasizes the importance of conducting a proper and fair investigation in criminal cases.

The court order states that the power of a magistrate to direct further investigation is significant and should be exercised sparingly to achieve the ends of justice. The court also states that the Code is a procedural document and should be interpreted in a way that advances the cause of justice. The court further explains that the power to order fresh or de novo investigation falls in the domain of higher courts and should be exercised sparingly. The court also discusses the scheme of Section 173 of the Code and how it deals with the exclusion of documents or statements submitted to the court.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 173(6) and (8) of the Code, which empower investigating agencies to exclude parts of statements or records that are not essential in the interest of justice and seek permission from the court to conduct further investigation or file a supplementary report. The court emphasizes the need for a fair and proper investigation that is unbiased, honest, just, and in accordance with the law to bring out the truth of the case before the court. The court also clarifies that the magistrate has the power to direct further investigation based on the facts of a given case, and the higher courts can direct further, re-investigation or even investigation de novo depending on the facts of a given case. The court answers two questions, stating that the court of competent jurisdiction must consider all reports, entire records, and documents submitted by the investigating agency, subject to specific orders passed by the learned magistrate or higher courts. The court also clarifies that investigating agencies are not empowered to conduct a fresh, de novo, or re-investigation in relation to the offense for which they have already filed a report, except upon the orders of the higher courts.

The court order states that further investigation is allowed under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C, but only superior courts can transfer the investigation from one agency to another. In this case, no superior court had transferred the investigation to the CBI. The court also clarifies that further investigation can only be conducted by the same agency that conducted the initial investigation, and not by a different agency. The court cites previous judgments to support its decision and concludes that the CBI cannot conduct further investigation after taking cognizance by the court on the criminal complaint filed by the Wild Life Inspector.

The court order states that a complainant who is a public servant cannot file a supplementary complaint to bring in additional accused persons in a criminal case. The only way to do so is by invoking Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The CBI in this case filed three supplementary complaints despite there being no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure that permits them to do so. The court also discusses letters from the Chief Wild Life Warden and the Government of NCT of Delhi regarding the transfer of a case to the CBI.

The court order discusses several issues related to the investigation and prosecution of a case involving illegal wildlife trade. The court finds that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) did not have the jurisdiction to conduct further investigation or file supplementary complaints in the case, as no superior court had authorized them to do so. Additionally, the court determines that the word "charge-sheet" in the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) does not include complaints filed by the state, which means that the cases relied upon by the CBI to invoke MCOCA were not sufficient. Overall, the court order provides a detailed analysis of various legal provisions and their application to the case at hand.

The court order states that the CBI failed to satisfy the mandatory requirements of invoking the stringent provisions of MCOCA against the accused persons. The supplementary complaints were the result of an investigation conducted by the CBI without jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of the law. Therefore, all accused persons of SC No. 42/2008 and 46/2011 are discharged, and accused Badal is discharged in absentia. Accused persons of SC No. 42/2008 are set at liberty on
