The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under section 482 of the Cr.P.C. by Brijesh Kumar Jaiswal against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petition challenged the order passed by the I ASJ, Devsar, District Singrauli, in Criminal Revision No.43/2018 confirming the order dated 23.7.2018 passed by JMFC Devsar, District Singrauli, in Crime No.112/2018 whereby the application filed by the applicant under section 457 Cr.P.C. for release of vehicle bearing registration No.UP64-T-5453 has been rejected.

The petitioner had sought the release of the vehicle, which had been seized in connection with multiple offenses. The Magistrate had rejected the application under section 457 Cr.P.C. on the grounds that he had no jurisdiction to release the vehicle under section 52-C of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioner had challenged this decision, arguing that the Magistrate had erred in his interpretation of the law.

The court, however, found that the Magistrate had correctly interpreted the law. Section 52-C of the Indian Forest Act provides that any vehicle or other conveyance used for the commission of an offense under the Act shall be liable to be seized by a forest officer. The section further provides that such vehicle or conveyance shall be released only on the order of a Magistrate, and only after the payment of a security deposit.

The court noted that the vehicle in question had been seized in connection with multiple offenses under the Indian Forest Act. As such, the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to release the vehicle under section 52-C of the Act. The court affirmed the impugned orders and dismissed the petition with liberty to take recourse of law as permissible under the Indian Forest Act, particularly section 52(3) and (4) of the Indian Forest Act.

Section 52(3) of the Indian Forest Act provides that any person claiming any right to a vehicle or other conveyance seized under the Act may apply to the Magistrate for the release of such vehicle or conveyance. The Magistrate may order the release of the vehicle or conveyance on the payment of a security deposit, subject to such conditions as he may deem fit.

Section 52(4) of the Indian Forest Act provides that any person aggrieved by an order of the Magistrate under section 52(3) may appeal to the Sessions Judge within thirty days from the date of such order. The Sessions Judge may confirm, modify or reverse the order of the Magistrate, or may make such other order as he deems fit.

In light of these provisions, the court held that the petitioner was not without recourse. He could still apply to the Magistrate for the release of the vehicle under section 52(3) of the Indian Forest Act, subject to the payment of a security deposit and such conditions as the Magistrate may deem fit. If the Magistrate were to reject his application, he could appeal to the Sessions Judge under section 52(4) of the Act.

In conclusion, the court order in question affirms the jurisdiction of forest officers to seize vehicles or other conveyances used for the commission of offenses under the Indian Forest Act. It also clarifies the procedure for the release of such vehicles or conveyances, and provides recourse for persons aggrieved by the decisions of Magistrates in this regard.
