The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Sessions Judge, Dhanbad in Criminal Revision No. 202 of 2010. The order in question rejected the petitioner's petition filed under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which sought to recall a witness for the purpose of proving certain documents. The petitioner's petition was dismissed as not maintainable, and the petitioner's appeal was also dismissed on the grounds that the order impugned was not revisable in nature.

The petitioner's main contention was that the Sessions Judge had erred in rejecting the petitioner's petition under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner argued that the documents in question were crucial to the case and that the witness in question was the only person who could provide evidence in support of the documents. The petitioner further argued that the Sessions Judge had failed to appreciate the importance of the documents and the witness in question.

The court, however, found no irregularity, illegality, or impropriety in the order of the Sessions Judge. The court noted that the Sessions Judge had considered the petitioner's petition under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and had rejected it on the grounds that it was not maintainable. The court further noted that the petitioner's appeal had also been dismissed on the grounds that the order impugned was not revisable in nature.

The court went on to explain that the power to recall a witness under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is discretionary in nature and that the court must exercise its discretion judiciously. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any compelling reasons for the witness to be recalled and that the Sessions Judge had therefore acted within his discretion in rejecting the petitioner's petition.

The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the documents in question were crucial to the case. The court observed that the petitioner had merely made a bald assertion that the documents were important without providing any supporting evidence. The court therefore concluded that the Sessions Judge had acted correctly in rejecting the petitioner's petition under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In conclusion, the court found no merit in the petitioner's petition and dismissed it. The court held that the Sessions Judge had acted correctly in rejecting the petitioner's petition under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the petitioner's appeal had been rightly dismissed on the grounds that the order impugned was not revisable in nature. The court emphasized that the power to recall a witness under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is discretionary in nature and that the court must exercise its discretion judiciously. The court further noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any compelling reasons for the witness to be recalled and that the Sessions Judge had therefore acted within his discretion in rejecting the petitioner's petition.
