Three court orders have been summarized, all of which pertain to eviction petitions filed by landlords against tenants for non-payment of rent. The first order deals with a dispute over whether interest on late rent payments becomes part of the rent or not, and whether non-payment of such interest can lead to eviction. The court held that interest accrued on late payment becomes legally recoverable arrears of rent, and failure to pay such arrears within two months of receiving notice can render the tenant liable to be evicted.

The second court order states that if a tenant fails to pay rent on time, including the interest of 15% per annum as per the law, they are in default and can be evicted under Section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act. The tenants cannot claim that the landlords did not accept the rent offered to them, as they should have deposited the rent under Section 27 of the DRC Act. The court orders the tenants to pay the interest on the arrears of rent within one month to extend the benefit of Section 14(2) of the DRC Act. The proviso of Section 14(2) does not apply in this case as the tenants did not obtain the benefit earlier. The eviction petition is proved in favor of the landlords.

The third court order requires the tenant respondents to pay interest at a rate of 15% per annum for the default period mentioned in the eviction petition. The interest must be paid to the landlords/petitioners within one month from the date of the order. The main eviction petition has been disposed of and a miscellaneous file will be prepared to track compliance with the order and the benefit under section 14(2) of the DRC Act. The respondent must appear and inform the court of compliance on December 20, 2010. The main eviction petition will be consigned to the record room.

In all three cases, the court has ruled in favor of the landlords and ordered the tenants to pay the arrears of rent and interest within a specified time frame. Failure to comply with the court order can result in eviction. The court has also clarified the legal status of interest on late rent payments, stating that it becomes legally recoverable arrears of rent. The court has emphasized the importance of complying with the provisions of the DRC Act, including depositing rent under Section 27 and paying interest on arrears of rent to extend the benefit of Section 14(2). 

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of timely payment of rent and adherence to the provisions of the DRC Act. Failure to comply with these provisions can result in legal action and eviction. The court has clarified the legal status of interest on late rent payments, providing clarity for landlords and tenants alike. It is important for both parties to understand their rights and obligations under the law to avoid disputes and legal action.
