The court orders in question relate to cases involving the death of wild elephants due to the storage of fertilizers and pesticides in unsafe godowns. In the first case, three individuals were accused of causing the death of two wild elephants by storing fertilizers in a non-standard godown owned by Tata Coffee Limited. The accused filed a petition to quash the proceedings, arguing that the allegations did not constitute an offense and that the continuation of proceedings would be vexatious and defeat the ends of justice. The court heard arguments from both sides and is considering the matter.

In the second case, two employees of a coffee estate were accused of causing the death of two wild elephants by storing fertilizers and pesticides in an unsafe godown. The court found that there was no specific allegation against the employees under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and that the complaint did not disclose any offense. The court also noted that the building was made of concrete and had no windows, and that the fertilizers and pesticides were kept in a safe place. The court concluded that the proceedings on the complaint were unsustainable in law and that the employees should not be subjected to prosecution and humiliation on the basis of a false and wholly untenable complaint.

The third court order states that keeping fertilizers and pesticides required for plantation in a godown is not an offense. The complaint against the petitioners for the death of wild elephants is baseless and an abuse of the court's time. Therefore, the complaint is quashed, and the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. The order was issued on June 19, 2017, and a copy was to be given to the District Munsif and Judicial Magistrate, Valparai, on February 21, 2019.

In all three cases, the issue at hand was the storage of fertilizers and pesticides in unsafe godowns, which led to the death of wild elephants. The accused in the first case argued that the allegations did not constitute an offense, while the accused in the second case were found to have no specific allegation against them under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court in the third case ruled that keeping fertilizers and pesticides required for plantation in a godown is not an offense.

The court's decision in the first case is pending, while the second and third cases have been resolved in favor of the accused. The court's decision in the second case was based on the fact that the building was made of concrete and had no windows, and that the fertilizers and pesticides were kept in a safe place. The court concluded that the proceedings on the complaint were unsustainable in law and that the employees should not be subjected to prosecution and humiliation on the basis of a false and wholly untenable complaint.

In the third case, the court ruled that the complaint against the petitioners for the death of wild elephants was baseless and an abuse of the court's time. The court quashed the complaint and closed the connected miscellaneous petitions.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of safe storage of fertilizers and pesticides, particularly in areas where wild animals may be affected. The court's decision in the second case emphasizes the need for specific allegations under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, while the court's decision in the third case emphasizes the need for complaints to be based on valid grounds and not be an abuse of the court's time.
