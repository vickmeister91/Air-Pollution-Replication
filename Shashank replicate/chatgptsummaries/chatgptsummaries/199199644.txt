The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Fatma Bee Mansuri against the Women and Child Development department. The petitioner was terminated from her job as an Anganwadi worker without any inquiry or following the principles of natural justice. The court found that the respondent violated the principles of natural justice and fair play and did not follow the procedure for discontinuing an Anganwadi worker as per the policy dated 10/07/2007. The court explained the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.

The court order emphasizes the importance of adhering to principles of natural justice, particularly the audi alteram partem rule, which requires that both sides be heard before any adverse order is passed. The order also notes that natural justice has evolved over time and that rules of natural justice are not always expressly stated in statutes or rules. The court order also discusses the two basic elements of a fair hearing: the nemo judex in causa sua rule (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and the audi alteram partem rule (hear the other side). The order also mentions the useless formality theory, which suggests that relief can be refused even if natural justice is not followed, but notes that this theory is controversial and that natural justice should be followed regardless of inconvenience.
