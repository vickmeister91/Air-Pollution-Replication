The Calcutta High Court has heard multiple cases involving disputes over the supply of fly ash from thermal power stations to cement manufacturers. In one case, M/S. Aso Cement Ltd. and West Bengal Power Development Corporation were involved in a dispute over the sale of dry fly ash. The petitioners claimed they required regular supply of fly ash for their cement plant and had previously received a supply of 5000 M.T. per month at a rate of Rs. 12/- per M.T. However, they later required 9000 M.T. per month and were unable to obtain a permanent linkage for this amount. The case involved multiple notices inviting tenders for procuring fly ash, and the petitioners filed multiple writ petitions, including one for a writ of mandamus commanding the respondent to issue the tender.

In another case, the court order pertained to a dispute over the supply of fly ash from a thermal power station. The petitioners had filed multiple writ petitions claiming entitlement to fly ash supply. The court had directed the respondent to issue tender documents to the petitioners, and the petitioner had participated in the tender process. However, the tender was later cancelled, and a fresh tender was issued. The court observed that the respondent cannot forego the opportunity to generate revenue by supplying fly ash and directed it to disclose its fly ash disposal and utilization policy. The petitioner had claimed entitlement to the existing supply of 5000 M.T. fly ash per month.

In yet another case, the court order pertained to a writ petition filed by the petitioners against the respondent no. 1 claiming supply of fly ash from KTPS. The petitioners claimed that they were entitled to receive an additional quantity of 4000 M.T. of dry fly ash per month from the respondent no. 1. However, during the course of the argument, the petitioners stated that they were not pressing the prayer for the supply of additional quantity of fly ash. The scope of the dispute was restricted to the claim of the petitioners for obtaining supply of 5000 M.T. of fly ash per month from KTPS. The court heard various contentions raised by the petitioners and observed that the respondent no. 1 cannot act arbitrarily while conferring benefit or largess or giving contracts.

In another case, a cement manufacturer and a thermal power station were involved in a dispute over the supply of dry fly ash, which is used as a raw material in cement production. The cement manufacturer argued that it has a preferential right to obtain continuous supply of dry fly ash from the power station, as per a government notification, and that the power station's policy of selling fly ash only through tenders is arbitrary and violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The power station argued that the dealings in fly ash are of a private character and that the petitioners have not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate their claim for monthly supply of fly ash. The court needed to determine whether the power station has a duty to supply fly ash to the cement manufacturer and whether the power station's policy is arbitrary and discriminatory.

In yet another case, the court order stated that the petitioner had not provided primary documents to substantiate their business as a cement manufacturer and their turnover. The court drew an adverse inference against the petitioner and rejected their writ petition. The court also stated that the petitioner was not entitled to receive 5000M.T. of fly ash per month at a specific rate. The respondent had issued tenders for procurement of fly ash, and the petitioner's tender was rejected. The court also mentioned a policy decision taken by the respondent to sell fly ash through tenders, which was not the subject matter of challenge in the present writ petition. The court concluded that the present writ petition was not maintainable as the issues were disputed questions of fact.

In the final case, the court order stated that the petitioners had no right to challenge the policy decision of the respondent to sell fly ash from its thermal power station through tender to extract higher revenue. The court also upheld the right of the respondent to sell dry fly ash generated at its thermal power station through tender for extracting maximum revenue. The petitioners could not sustain their claim in the present writ petition by alleging the said policy decision of the respondent to be illegal. The court found no merit in the contention of the petitioners that the new policy decision of the respondent to sell fly ash through tender to be either arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court rejected the writ petition and ordered the petitioner to pay costs assessed at Rs. 30,000/- to the Calcutta High Court Legal Services Committee within December 15, 2016.

In summary, the Calcutta High Court has heard multiple cases involving disputes over the supply of fly ash from thermal power stations to cement manufacturers. The court has directed the respondents to disclose their fly ash disposal and utilization policy and has observed that the respondents cannot forego the opportunity to generate revenue by supplying fly ash. The court has also upheld the right of the respondents to sell dry fly ash generated at its thermal power station through tender for extracting maximum revenue. The court has rejected writ petitions where the petitioners have failed to establish their right to obtain the supply of fly ash and have no right to challenge the policy decision of the respondents.
