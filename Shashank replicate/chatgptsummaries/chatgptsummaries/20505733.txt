The court order pertains to two cases, one filed by Jose K.J against the Nenmara Grama Panchayat and the other filed by the 4th respondent in the first case. The petitioner in the first case owns a workshop that has been the subject of complaints regarding noise pollution and other issues. The Pollution Control Board has conducted inspections and issued notices, and the petitioner has complied with some measures but not others. The court notes that there is currently no valid consent or license for the workshop to operate. The second case involves the 4th respondent seeking to stop the illegal operation of the workshop.

The court order states that the petitioner does not have a valid license or consent from the Pollution Control Board to conduct a workshop. The Pollution Control Board had refused to renew the license due to non-compliance with remedial measures. The court directs the petitioner to comply with all remedial measures and submit a report to the Pollution Control Board. The Board will conduct an inspection and take a decision on the renewal of consent. If consent is granted, the panchayat will consider the renewal of the license. The implementation of certain documents will be kept in abeyance for two months, but the petitioner cannot continue functioning without renewal of consent and license.
