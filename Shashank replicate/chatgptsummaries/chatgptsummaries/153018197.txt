The Gauhati High Court is hearing a case involving the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) and 46 individuals from various villages in Arunachal Pradesh. The NHPC is seeking a review of a previous court order that halted construction on the Lower Subansiri Hydro Electric Project. The individuals from the villages are opposing the project and have been granted a stay on construction until further notice.

The case involves a review petition filed by NHPC Ltd. seeking modification of an order passed by the court in a writ appeal. The petitioners claim that they are prejudiced by the impugned order, which allowed the writ appeal by setting aside the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Single Judge of the Court. The main grievance of the petitioners is that the Court accepted the report submitted by the Ombudsman, which stated that the respondents No.1 to 40 are the actual land-owners in respect of the land affected by the Subansiri Lower Hydro Electric Project. The petitioners are also aggrieved by the further direction that the Deputy Commissioner would hear the respondents No.1 to 40 and assess the dues and acquisition compensation in accordance with the report of the Ombudsman and compensate their entitled dues in accordance with law.

The court heard the arguments of the parties and reserved its judgment. The court order directs the identification of actual landowners who have not received full compensation as assessed by the Loss Assessment Committee, 2010, to be completed within three months. The Ombudsman is to file a report within five months indicating the list of actual landowners who have not received full compensation. The petitioners are questioning the correctness of the Ombudsman's report, which was accepted by the court without giving them a reasonable opportunity to challenge it.

The court finds that the acceptance of the report stands vitiated by two counts: firstly, it was accepted without giving the petitioners a fair opportunity to address the court on the report, and secondly, the court erroneously presumed that the petitioners had participated in the proceedings before the Ombudsman. The court quotes previous cases to support its decision to review the order.

The court order acknowledges that valuable rights of the appellant have been taken away by the impugned directions. The court also states that while exercising its power of review, it acts as a court of law and equity and can review a clear error or omission on its part. The court allows the review application and recalls the impugned order, restoring the proceedings for further hearing. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the case involves the NHPC seeking a review of a previous court order that halted construction on the Lower Subansiri Hydro Electric Project. The individuals from the villages are opposing the project and have been granted a stay on construction until further notice. The court order directs the identification of actual landowners who have not received full compensation as assessed by the Loss Assessment Committee, 2010, to be completed within three months. The Ombudsman is to file a report within five months indicating the list of actual landowners who have not received full compensation. The court finds that the acceptance of the report stands vitiated by two counts and allows the review application, recalling the impugned order and restoring the proceedings for further hearing.
