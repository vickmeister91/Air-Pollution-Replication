The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by E.I.H. Limited challenging an order passed by the Collector of Udaipur directing the petitioner company to stop construction work on the second phase of Hotel Trident. The court had previously issued a notification declaring a "No Construction Zone" around the lakes in Udaipur due to environmental concerns. The petitioner company argued that their construction fell under an exception carved out by the court. The court considered the arguments of both parties and made a decision.

The court order discusses a case involving the construction of a hotel on a piece of land in Udaipur. The court notes that the petitioner company had been granted permission to construct the hotel, but the permission had expired. The court concludes that the Urban Improvement Trust (U.I.T.) has the power to renew the permission, and therefore the petitioner company can continue construction. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and environmental protection, particularly in a tourist destination like Udaipur. The U.I.T. is directed to pass a fresh order on the application for extension of time for completion of the hotel within one month.
