The Jharkhand High Court recently passed a significant order in a case filed by Soumen Chatterjee and Subir Das against the State of Jharkhand and Shankar Kishore Mahto. The petitioners had sought to quash an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, which had taken cognizance of an offence under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The complaint was made by Mahto, who alleged that the owners of hospitals threw biomedical waste in public places and drains, exposing people to diseases.

The petitioners argued that the provisions laid down in Rule 11(b) of the rules framed under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 had not been followed, and therefore, the court was precluded from taking cognizance of the offence. The court allowed the petition and quashed the entire criminal proceeding, including the order taking cognizance.

The case highlights the importance of following the rules and regulations laid down under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The Act was enacted to provide for the protection and improvement of the environment and for the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants, and property. The Act lays down various provisions for the management of hazardous waste, including biomedical waste.

Rule 11(b) of the rules framed under the Act lays down the procedure for the disposal of biomedical waste. It requires that the waste be segregated, packed, transported, and disposed of in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board. The rule also requires that the waste be disposed of in a manner that does not cause any environmental pollution or health hazards.

In the present case, the petitioners argued that the owners of hospitals had not followed the provisions laid down in Rule 11(b) while disposing of biomedical waste. They alleged that the waste was thrown in public places and drains, exposing people to diseases. The court found merit in their argument and quashed the criminal proceeding.

The court's order is significant as it emphasizes the importance of following the rules and regulations laid down under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

The court's order also highlights the need for proper management of hazardous waste, including biomedical waste. The improper disposal of such waste can cause environmental pollution and health hazards. It is, therefore, essential to follow the guidelines laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board for the disposal of such waste.
