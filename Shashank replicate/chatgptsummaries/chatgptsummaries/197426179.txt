The Karnataka High Court has recently issued three court orders pertaining to writ petitions filed by various individuals and groups against the leasing of land by the State of Karnataka to the Mysore Paper Mills Ltd. The petitioners argue that the lease is illegal, unconstitutional, and violates the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The respondents include the State of Karnataka, the Mysore Paper Mills Ltd, and various government officials. The court has yet to make a ruling on the matter.

In the first court order, the petitioners sought to direct the respondents to refrain from cutting, uprooting, destroying, and burning the existing natural growth, cultivating and planting any plantation on the land measuring 121 acres 7 gunthas of Chikmakoppa village, Soraba Taluk, Shivamoga district. However, the court dismissed the writ petition and other related petitions, stating that the lands leased did not come under the purview of reserved forest and wildlife sanctuary. The court also appointed a committee to oversee the management of the leased lands, and the committee's recommendations were fully complied with. The court found no merit in the writ petition and dismissed it.

In the second court order, the petitioner claimed that a lease granted to a paper mill company violated the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioner argued that the lease was granted without prior approval from the Central Government, and that there were violations of the terms of the lease. However, the court found that while the lease was granted before the Act came into force, the necessary approval had been obtained. The court also found that the company had surrendered some of the leased land and was adhering to the Forest Management Plan. The court ultimately found no grounds to interfere with the previous order.

The third court order pertains to three writ petitions filed by various individuals and groups against the leasing of land by the State of Karnataka to the Mysore Paper Mills Ltd. The petitioners argue that the lease is illegal, unconstitutional, and violates the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The respondents include the State of Karnataka, the Mysore Paper Mills Ltd, and various government officials. The court has yet to make a ruling on the matter.

In summary, the court orders relate to the leasing of land by the State of Karnataka to the Mysore Paper Mills Ltd and the alleged violations of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. While the court dismissed one writ petition and found no grounds to interfere with another, the third writ petition is still pending a ruling. The court has appointed a committee to oversee the management of the leased lands, and the company has surrendered some of the leased land and is adhering to the Forest Management Plan. The court's decisions reflect a balance between environmental protection and economic development.
