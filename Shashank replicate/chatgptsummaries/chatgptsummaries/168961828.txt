The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Lalit Khera against M/S Barclays Bank PLC. The revisionist had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for supply of certain documents, which was dismissed by the trial court. Dissatisfied with this decision, the revisionist appealed against it, and the court allowed the revision petition, directing the respondent to supply the requested documents if they are in possession of the same. The parties were directed to appear before the court on a specified date, and the trial court record was sent back along with the copy of the order.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Lalit Khera and M/S Barclays Bank PLC. Khera had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for supply of certain documents, which was dismissed by the trial court. Section 91 Cr.P.C empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing if it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the trial court had dismissed Khera's application on the ground that the documents sought were not relevant to the case.

Dissatisfied with this decision, Khera filed a criminal revision petition before the court. A revision petition is a legal remedy available to a person aggrieved by an order passed by a subordinate court. The revisionist can file a petition before the higher court, seeking revision of the order passed by the lower court. The higher court can either dismiss the petition or allow it, and pass such orders as it deems fit.

In this case, the court allowed Khera's revision petition and directed the respondent, M/S Barclays Bank PLC, to supply the requested documents if they are in possession of the same. The court held that the documents sought by Khera were relevant to the case and were necessary for the proper adjudication of the matter. The court also directed the parties to appear before it on a specified date.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of fair trial and the right to access to justice. The right to access to justice is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution of India. It includes the right to a fair trial, the right to legal aid, and the right to access to courts. The court's decision in this case ensures that Khera's right to a fair trial is not compromised due to the non-availability of relevant documents.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of Section 91 Cr.P.C in ensuring a fair trial. Section 91 Cr.P.C empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing if it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This provision ensures that all relevant documents are made available to the court, and the truth is ascertained in a fair and just manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Lalit Khera v. M/S Barclays Bank PLC is a significant one as it upholds the principle of fair trial and the right to access to justice. The court's decision ensures that Khera's right to a fair trial is not compromised due to the non-availability of relevant documents. The decision also highlights the importance of Section 91 Cr.P.C in ensuring a fair trial and the ascertainment of truth in a fair and just manner.
