The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by employees of private companies seeking enforcement of their service conditions. In the first case, employees of SIEMENS Ltd. had not been continued beyond the age of 58 years, while employees in other units were continued till the age of 60 years. The employees filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking enforcement of the terms of their contract of employment against the private company. The court considered the maintainability of the writ petition and held that a writ petition seeking enforcement of terms of contract of employment against a private company is not maintainable unless there is a violation of statutory provisions or public law element involved. The court referred to various decisions of the Supreme Court in this regard and held that the present case did not involve any public law element and was purely enforcement of terms of contract between the petitioners and their employer. Therefore, the writ petition was dismissed.

In the second case, employees of a private company had filed a writ petition seeking enforcement of their service conditions. The court discussed the criteria for determining whether a body is financially, functionally, and administratively controlled by the government. Mere regulatory control does not make a body a state. The court also noted that not all decisions of a body performing public duty are subject to judicial review, only those with a public element. The case in question involved a private company that is not controlled by the government and does not perform a public duty. Therefore, the writ petition seeking enforcement of service conditions of employees working in the company was not maintainable and was dismissed.

In both cases, the court held that a writ petition seeking enforcement of terms of contract of employment against a private company is not maintainable unless there is a violation of statutory provisions or public law element involved. The court referred to various decisions of the Supreme Court in this regard and held that the present cases did not involve any public law element and were purely enforcement of terms of contract between the petitioners and their employers. Therefore, the writ petitions were dismissed.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of understanding the criteria for determining whether a body is financially, functionally, and administratively controlled by the government. Mere regulatory control does not make a body a state, and not all decisions of a body performing public duty are subject to judicial review. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for employees to carefully review their employment contracts and understand their rights and obligations under the terms of the contract. If there is a violation of statutory provisions or public law element involved, employees may have grounds to file a writ petition seeking enforcement of their service conditions. However, if there is no such violation, the writ petition may not be maintainable.
