The Patna High Court has recently ordered the release of Doman Singh and Shashi Kumar on bail of Rs. 20,000 each with two sureties of the same amount, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioners were accused of engaging in illegal mining of sand, but their counsel claimed that they had purchased sand from a contractor for personal use and that the allegations were false and concocted.

The court has ordered the petitioners to fully cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case, failing which their bail bond may be cancelled. The order was passed by Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah on a petition filed by the accused seeking anticipatory bail in connection with an FIR lodged against them under Sections 379, 411, 414, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code.

The counsel for the petitioners argued that the allegations against them were false and that they had purchased sand from a contractor for personal use. He further submitted that the petitioners were ready to cooperate with the investigation and that they had no intention of absconding or tampering with evidence.

The prosecution, on the other hand, opposed the bail application and argued that the petitioners were involved in illegal mining of sand and that they had no right to extract sand from the riverbed without obtaining the necessary permission from the authorities. The prosecution also argued that the petitioners were likely to tamper with evidence and that they had a history of criminal activities.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court observed that the allegations against the petitioners were serious in nature and that the investigation was still ongoing. However, the court also noted that the petitioners had no criminal antecedents and that they were ready to cooperate with the investigation.

The court, therefore, granted bail to the petitioners on the condition that they furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court also directed the petitioners to fully cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case and to not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses in any manner.

The court further warned the petitioners that if they failed to comply with the conditions of the bail, their bail bond may be cancelled and they may be taken into custody. The court also directed the petitioners to appear before the investigating officer as and when required and to not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted bail to Doman Singh and Shashi Kumar on the condition that they fully cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case. The court has also warned the petitioners that their bail bond may be cancelled if they fail to comply with the conditions of the bail. The case is still ongoing and further developments are awaited.
