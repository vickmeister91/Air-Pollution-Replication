In the first court order, the applicant had requested an amendment to their application for regular bail in a criminal case. The mistake in the application was that "Section 323" was mentioned instead of "Section 333". The court allowed the correction and directed that the necessary amendment be carried out. However, the order did not provide a decision on the matter of granting regular bail.

The second court order granted bail to the applicant in connection with a specific FIR. The court noted that a substantial part of the investigation was over and there was no possibility of tampering with evidence. The applicant was required to execute a personal bond of Rs.10,000 and one surety of the same amount. Additionally, the applicant was required to follow certain conditions such as not leaving the state without permission, surrendering their passport, and marking their presence at the police station on specific days. The court warned that if any of these conditions were breached, appropriate action would be taken. The trial court was also instructed not to be influenced by the observations made by the court while granting bail.
