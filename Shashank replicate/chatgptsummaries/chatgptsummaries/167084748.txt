The court has granted bail to Shiva, also known as Shivshankar, who is accused in a case under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Shiva has been in jail since June 17, 2019, and has no prior criminal history. The court has imposed certain conditions for his release on bail, including not tampering with prosecution evidence, cooperating in the trial, and not committing any further crimes. Additionally, the court has ordered the verification of Shiva's identity, status, and residence proof before accepting the bonds.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and the prevention of their hunting, poaching, and trade. Section 9/51 of the Act deals with the punishment for hunting or poaching of wild animals. The punishment for such an offense can range from imprisonment for a term of three years to seven years and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000.

Shiva's case is related to the hunting or poaching of wild animals, and he has been in jail for over a year. However, the court has taken into consideration the fact that he has no prior criminal history and has granted him bail. The court has also imposed certain conditions for his release on bail, which are standard conditions in such cases.

One of the conditions is that Shiva should not tamper with prosecution evidence. This means that he should not destroy or alter any evidence that is related to the case. Tampering with evidence is a serious offense and can lead to further charges against the accused.

Another condition is that Shiva should cooperate in the trial. This means that he should attend all court hearings and provide any information or evidence that is required by the court. Failure to cooperate in the trial can lead to the cancellation of bail and further charges against the accused.

The court has also ordered that Shiva's identity, status, and residence proof should be verified before accepting the bonds. This is a standard procedure in such cases to ensure that the accused is not a flight risk and will appear in court for the trial.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Shiva, who is accused in a case under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has imposed certain conditions for his release on bail, including not tampering with prosecution evidence, cooperating in the trial, and not committing any further crimes. The court has also ordered the verification of Shiva's identity, status, and residence proof before accepting the bonds. These conditions are standard in such cases and are aimed at ensuring that the accused appears in court for the trial and does not commit any further offenses.
