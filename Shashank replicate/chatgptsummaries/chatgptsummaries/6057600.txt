The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Dolphil Minerals against the Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary to Government of Haryana and others. The petitioner had won an auction for a minor mineral quarry in Kadarpur, but faced issues with demarcation and possession of the area. The trial court dismissed the petitioner's suit, stating that an appeal under Rule 47 of the Punjab Minor Mineral Concession Rules was available. The petitioner filed an appeal, but also discovered that stone mining was prohibited in the area under the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, and that mining operations were prohibited in the entire Gurgaon district by the Supreme Court. The petitioner's attempt to amend the initial suit to bring these facts on record was rejected, and the lease period expired. The court ultimately disposed of the case as infructuous.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking a direction to refund the amount deposited for a mining lease in Village Kadarpur. The petitioner claims that mining activities were prohibited in the area under Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1900. The respondents argue that the notification had expired and the land was not forest land on the date of auction. The court dismisses the preliminary issue raised by the respondents and agrees with the petitioner's claim that the scope of the suit and the writ petition are different. The court also notes that the respondents have admitted certain factual aspects.

The court order states that mining in the Aravali Hill areas of Haryana and Rajasthan should be stopped, including in forest areas. The state government made a decision to stop mining activities in the area, including those with expired notifications, on November 29, 2002. The petitioner is still liable to pay dead rent from February 21, 2002, but the controversy arises from the demarcation of the land and orders passed by the Supreme Court and the state government. The court ultimately rules that the petitioner is entitled to a refund of the amount deposited for the mining lease.

The court has ordered a refund of Rs. 58.66 lacs to be given to the petitioner, Chand Parkash, within one month from the date of the order. If the refund is not made within the given time, it will carry a simple interest of 12% per annum. The petition has been allowed and the parties will bear their own costs.
