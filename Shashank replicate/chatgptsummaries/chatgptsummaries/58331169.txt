Chhindwara under Section 9, 39, 50, 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleges that Ramlal and other accused persons hunted wild scheduled animals using electric supply in G.I wire.

The court allowed Ramlal's application for regular bail on the grounds that he has been in custody for more than four months, the offence is triable by J.M.F.C, and he has no previous criminal record.
