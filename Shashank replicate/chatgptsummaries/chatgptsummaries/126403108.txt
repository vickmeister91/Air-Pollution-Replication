The court orders presented in this summary pertain to cases filed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. In the first case, WLI filed a case against Sandeep for selling the skin and body parts of a wild animal. Sandeep was apprehended by a raiding party comprising wildlife officers and police personnel. The prosecution presented evidence, including witness statements and seizure memos, but the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to have been falsely implicated. After hearing arguments and examining evidence, the court acquitted the accused on 27 September 2014.

In the second case, the accused was apprehended by the police for possession of wildlife, but the defense argued that he was falsely implicated and that the police demanded money for his release. The prosecution's witnesses had inconsistencies in their testimony, and no independent witnesses were present at the time of the arrest, casting doubt on the prosecution's version of events. The court concluded that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.

The third court order emphasizes the importance of following proper search and seizure procedures, including the presence of independent witnesses, to lend credibility to the proceedings. The absence of independent witnesses does not necessarily disbelieve the evidence of official witnesses, but if their evidence is found to be unreliable, the lack of corroboration through an independent source casts doubt on the prosecution's version. The order also raises doubts about the genuineness of the recovered skin and claws, as they were not sent for testing and were not properly identified and sealed.

In the fourth case, the court noted the possibility of tampering with the case property as no identification mark was put on it before sealing it. The testimony of a witness created doubt, and chances of false implication of the accused could not be ruled out. The court must ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice, and the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charges, and the bail bond was canceled. The case property, if any, would be confiscated to the state, and the file would be consigned to the record room.

In all these cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused were acquitted. The court emphasized the importance of following proper search and seizure procedures and the need for independent witnesses to lend credibility to the proceedings. The court also raised doubts about the genuineness of the recovered skin and claws, which were not sent for testing and were not properly identified and sealed. The court orders highlight the need for a fair and just trial, where the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused must be given a fair chance to defend themselves.
