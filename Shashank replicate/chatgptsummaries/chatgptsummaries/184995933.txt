The court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Kripa Shankar against the State of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner claimed that his land was being treated as forest land even though it had been exempted by the Forest Settlement Officer. However, the court held that unless the Central Government approves the de-notification of the proposed forest land, it cannot be treated as revenue land. The court cited the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad vs Union Of India & Ors case to support its decision.

The case of Kripa Shankar vs State of Uttar Pradesh revolves around the classification of land as forest land. The petitioner, Kripa Shankar, claimed that his land had been exempted by the Forest Settlement Officer and should not be treated as forest land. However, the State of Uttar Pradesh continued to treat the land as forest land, which prevented the petitioner from using it for agricultural purposes.

The court examined the relevant laws and regulations and found that the Forest Settlement Officer had indeed exempted the land from being classified as forest land. However, the court also noted that the Central Government had not approved the de-notification of the proposed forest land. As a result, the land could not be treated as revenue land and the State of Uttar Pradesh was within its rights to continue to classify it as forest land.

The court cited the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad vs Union Of India & Ors case to support its decision. In that case, the Supreme Court had held that forest land cannot be de-notified without the approval of the Central Government. The court noted that the same principle applied in the present case and that the petitioner's land could not be de-notified without the approval of the Central Government.

The court's decision has important implications for landowners in India. It underscores the importance of obtaining the approval of the Central Government before attempting to de-notify forest land. It also highlights the challenges faced by landowners who are seeking to use their land for agricultural purposes but are prevented from doing so due to its classification as forest land.

Overall, the court's decision in Kripa Shankar vs State of Uttar Pradesh is a reminder of the complex legal framework governing land use in India. It highlights the need for landowners to be aware of the relevant laws and regulations and to seek legal advice when necessary. It also underscores the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the needs of landowners and the broader community.
