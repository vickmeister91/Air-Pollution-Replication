The court order pertains to three separate applications filed in relation to a criminal case filed against a company for water pollution. The first two applications were filed by the directors and chairman of the company seeking to quash the criminal case against them. The third application was filed by the company itself seeking to discharge the criminal case against it.

In the first two applications, the directors and chairman of the company argued that they were not responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the company and that there was no evidence of their involvement in the alleged offence. They also cited previous cases where they were discharged from similar complaints. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) opposed the applications, arguing that the applicants were responsible for the conduct of the business and administration and that there was a strong case against them.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment. In the second application filed by the company, the court examined the complaint and found that specific allegations were not made against the applicants, except for the Production Manager. The court also referred to previous judgments to establish that specific charges or roles must be attributed to directors to make out an offense against them. The court concluded that in order to attract Section 47(2) of the Water Act, specific allegations of a very specific role attributed to the applicants would be necessary.

In the third application, the court found that the applicants could not be held responsible for the company's actions as they were not residing or available at the premises on a day-to-day basis. The court also noted that previous cases involving the same company and accused have been discharged or quashed. The court found that the specific role of the applicants in the company's affairs was not coming out on record. The court ordered the prosecution of the applicants to be quashed and directed them to deposit an amount of Rs.1,25,000/- with the local office of the GPCB within a period of one month from the date of the order. The GPCB was directed to accept such amount and put it to an appropriate use in the interest of the environment.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of specific allegations and charges being attributed to directors and other individuals in order to make out an offense against them. It also emphasizes the need for evidence of involvement in the alleged offense and the importance of previous cases and judgments in establishing legal precedent. The order also highlights the role of the GPCB in enforcing environmental regulations and the importance of appropriate use of funds collected through penalties and fines.
