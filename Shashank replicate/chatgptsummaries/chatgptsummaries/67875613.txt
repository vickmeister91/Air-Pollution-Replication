In two separate cases, individuals were accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by possessing leopard and spotted deer skins without a legal source of procurement or license. In both cases, the prosecution presented evidence including witness testimonies and seizure memos. However, the accused in both cases pleaded not guilty and claimed that they were falsely implicated.

In the first case, Rajesh Gupta and Satish Kumar Gupta were accused of the violation. After considering the submissions of both parties and relevant provisions of the Act, the court acquitted the accused on June 26, 2013. The court order stated that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused, and they were acquitted of all charges. The bail bonds of the accused were extended for six months, and any case property was confiscated to the state. The judgment was made available on the Delhi District Court website.

In the second case, two accused were charged with possession of leopard and spotted deer skin in contravention of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The defense argued that the accused were innocent and that there were material contradictions in the prosecution's case. The court found that the case property was produced in an unsealed condition and that there were no independent witnesses, which cast doubt on the prosecution's version. The court held that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that acquittal of a guilty person should be preferred to conviction of an innocent person.

The court order emphasized that the accused cannot be convicted if guilt is not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
