In a recent court order, the petitioner, John Hansda, had requested the quashing of criminal proceedings against him for running a crusher machine without proper consent from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. However, the court dismissed the request, stating that a prima facie case had been made against the petitioner and that he had been warned repeatedly by the Board before the complaint was filed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had been operating the crusher machine without obtaining the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board. The Board had repeatedly warned him about the same, but he had failed to comply with their instructions. As a result, a complaint was filed against him, and criminal proceedings were initiated.

The court observed that the petitioner had not raised any substantial grounds for quashing the criminal proceedings against him. He had merely argued that he had not been given a proper opportunity to present his case before the Board. However, the court noted that the petitioner had been given ample opportunity to comply with the Board's instructions, but he had failed to do so.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the complaint filed against him. Therefore, the court concluded that a prima facie case had been made against the petitioner, and the criminal proceedings against him could not be quashed.

However, the court did give the petitioner the option to raise his points at an appropriate stage. This means that the petitioner can still present his case before the court during the trial, and the court will consider his arguments before passing a final judgment.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's request for quashing the criminal proceedings against him was based on the fact that he had been operating the crusher machine without obtaining the necessary consent from the Pollution Control Board. The court observed that a prima facie case had been made against him, and he had been warned repeatedly before the complaint was filed. While the petitioner was given the option to raise his points at an appropriate stage, the court's decision highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary permissions before operating any machinery that may have an impact on the environment.
