The court order in question pertains to a civil appeal case between Prasad Anant Gurav and The Sub-Divisional Officer. The petitioner had sought relief from the court, but the respondent argued that the petitioner should approach the Green Tribunal instead. The petitioner then sought to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the Green Tribunal, and the court allowed it.

However, the interim order passed earlier by the court was continued for 15 days to enable the petitioner to seek appropriate interim relief before the Green Tribunal. During this time, the court directed that the respondents should act only in accordance with the conditions mentioned in the order passed by the Pollution Control Department until any further orders are passed by the Pollution Control Board or the Green Tribunal.

It is important to note that the Green Tribunal was instructed not to be influenced by the interim order passed by the court. This means that the Green Tribunal will make its decision based on its own independent assessment of the case, without being swayed by any previous court orders.

All contentions of the parties were kept open, which means that both the petitioner and the respondent are free to pursue their arguments and present evidence before the Green Tribunal. The petition was disposed of as withdrawn, which means that the court will not be making any further decisions on this matter.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and seeking relief from the appropriate authorities. While the court was willing to grant the petitioner some relief, it ultimately deferred to the Green Tribunal as the proper forum for resolving this dispute. By doing so, the court ensured that the case will be heard by an independent body with the expertise and authority to make a fair and informed decision.
