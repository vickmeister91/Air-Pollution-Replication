The Aravali College of Education had filed a petition against the State of Haryana and others, citing the revocation/cancellation of Consent to Establish granted under section 21 of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the court order states that the petition has become infructuous due to this revocation/cancellation. As a result, the petition has been dismissed.

This court order highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary permissions before establishing any institution or industry. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a crucial legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. It mandates that any person or institution that wishes to establish an industry or operation that may cause air pollution must obtain a Consent to Establish from the State Pollution Control Board.

In this case, it appears that the Aravali College of Education had obtained a Consent to Establish but had it revoked or cancelled for some reason. This led to the filing of a petition against the State of Haryana and others. However, since the Consent to Establish was no longer valid, the petition became infructuous and was dismissed.

This court order serves as a reminder to all institutions and industries to comply with environmental regulations and obtain the necessary permissions before commencing operations. Failure to do so can result in legal action and the revocation of permissions, as seen in this case.

It is also important to note that the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is just one of several environmental regulations in India. Other important legislations include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. These laws aim to protect the environment and ensure sustainable development in the country.

In conclusion, the court order dismissing the petition filed by Aravali College of Education against the State of Haryana and others highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary permissions before establishing any institution or industry. It serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to prioritize environmental protection and sustainable development in their operations.
