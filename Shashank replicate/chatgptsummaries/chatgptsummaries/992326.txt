In the first court order, the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board appealed a writ petition filed by agriculturists who were affected by the acquisition of their lands for industrial purposes. The High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore directed the Board to leave a land of one kilometer as a buffer zone from the outer periphery of the village in order to maintain a green area towards preservation of land for grazing of cattle, agricultural operation, and for development of social forestry and to develop the area into a green belt. The Court further directed that whenever there was an acquisition of land for industrial, commercial or non-agricultural purposes, except for residential purposes, the authorities must leave one kilometer area from the village limits as a free zone or green area to maintain ecological equilibrium.

The Board appealed the decision, arguing that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction and that the lands in question had lost their agrarian character. However, the Supreme Court directed the Board to carry out necessary exercises regarding the impact of development on ecology and environment and to make it mandatory for the allottee to obtain necessary clearance for the project from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Department of Ecology and Environment before execution of the agreement.

In the second court order, the issue of environmental degradation and its consequences, including global warming, rising sea levels, acid rain, and depletion of ozone layers, is discussed. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and balancing economic and social needs with environmental considerations. The Stockholm Declaration and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development are cited as important international agreements on environmental protection. The court also recognizes the Precautionary Principle, which requires anticipating and preventing environmental degradation and placing the burden of proof on developers to show that their actions are environmentally benign. The court emphasizes the importance of creating environmental awareness and involving people in environmental management for sustainable development.

In the third court order, three principles of sustainable development are outlined: the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays, and Public Trust Doctrine. The Precautionary Principle states that authorities must anticipate, prevent, and attack the causes of environmental degradation, and lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent degradation. The Polluter Pays principle holds that the financial costs of preventing or remedying damage caused by pollution should lie with the undertakings which cause the pollution. The Public Trust Doctrine states that certain resources like air, sea, water, and forests have such great importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership.

This court order emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the need to maintain a balance between development and the ecosystem. It highlights the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays, and Public Trust Doctrine as important principles of sustainable development. The court also directs that before acquisition of lands for development, the consequence and adverse impact of development on the environment must be properly comprehended, and the lands be acquired for development that they do not gravely impair the ecology and environment.
