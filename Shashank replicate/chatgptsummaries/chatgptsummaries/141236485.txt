The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s. Aurobindo Pharma Limited against the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and another. The petitioner sought a declaration that the levy and collection of sewerage cess by the respondents in the monthly bill of the petitioner's unit is illegal, arbitrary, and contrary to the provisions of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1989.

The court heard the submissions of both parties and perused the material record. The court observed that the effluents of the petitioner's unit are being carried to Patancheru Enviro-Tech Limited (PETL) for further treatment and discharge of the effluents. The first respondent is collecting sewerage cess from PETL as per the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 03.08.2002 between PETL and the first respondent.

The court held that the petitioner's unit is ultimately joining the sewerage system of the Board and is being eventually treated at the sewerage treatment plant of the Board, and therefore, the Board is entitled to levy and collect the sewerage cess on the petitioner's unit. The court order states that the petitioner's unit is being served by the sewerage system of the Board, even though the effluents are not being directly let into the sewerage mains.

The court finds that the two contentions raised by the petitioner's counsel have already been examined and negatived, and there are no new vital facts to examine afresh. The court also notes that the petitioner did not mention the dismissal of a previous writ petition in their pleadings, and therefore, the present writ petition is liable to be dismissed.

The court dismisses the writ petition and there shall be no order as to costs.
