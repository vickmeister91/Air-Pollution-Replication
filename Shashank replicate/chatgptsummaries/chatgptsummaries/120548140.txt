The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Suresh Khemani, who was apprehended for arrest in connection with a case under Section 379/411 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4/21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, as well as Section 37 of the Air Pollution Act. The prosecution case relates to the seizure of two tractors loaded with boulders, and Khemani was falsely implicated as the owner of the tractors. The court granted anticipatory bail to Khemani on the condition that he surrenders within two weeks and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount.

The case against Khemani is related to the seizure of two tractors loaded with boulders. The prosecution alleged that Khemani was the owner of the tractors and had illegally extracted the boulders from a nearby riverbed. The prosecution also alleged that Khemani had violated the Air Pollution Act by not taking adequate measures to prevent air pollution during the extraction process.

However, Khemani denied all the allegations and claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case. He argued that he was not the owner of the tractors and had no involvement in the extraction of boulders. He also claimed that he had taken all necessary measures to prevent air pollution during the extraction process.

The Jharkhand High Court, after hearing both sides, granted anticipatory bail to Khemani. The court observed that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against Khemani and that he was entitled to bail. The court also noted that Khemani had no criminal antecedents and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

However, the court imposed certain conditions on Khemani while granting him anticipatory bail. The court directed Khemani to surrender within two weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount. The court also directed Khemani to cooperate with the investigation and not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Khemani is significant as it provides him with protection against arrest in the case. Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. This provision is intended to protect a person from harassment and wrongful arrest by the police.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Suresh Khemani is a significant development in the case against him. The court's decision is based on the observation that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against Khemani. The court's decision also highlights the importance of the provision of anticipatory bail in protecting individuals from harassment and wrongful arrest by the police.
