The Supreme Court of India recently reviewed a case where the High Court of Madhya Pradesh had held that the Water Act and the Air Act had impliedly repealed Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case involved the closure of industrial units due to pollution caused by effluent discharge. The Supreme Court held that the two Acts and Section 133 of the Code could coexist as they operated in different fields with different aims and objects. The Court also noted that the provisions of the two Acts were curative, preventive, and penal, while Section 133 was only preventive. The Court rejected the High Court's view and held that the SDM had jurisdiction to act under Section 133 of the Code.

The court order states that the provisions of Section 133 of the Code are preventive measures, while the provisions of the two Acts are curative, preventive, and penal. The High Court was not justified in holding that there was an implied repeal of Section 133 of the Code. The appeals are allowed to a certain extent. If applications are pending before the Board, it should take necessary steps for their disposal. The question of whether there was an infraction under Section 133 of the Code or the two Acts is a matter for the appropriate forum to decide, and the court does not express any opinion on that.

The case highlights the importance of environmental laws and the need to enforce them effectively. The Water Act and the Air Act are crucial pieces of legislation that aim to protect the environment and prevent pollution. The Supreme Court's decision to allow the two Acts and Section 133 of the Code to coexist is a positive step towards ensuring that these laws are enforced effectively.

The Court's decision also underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to environmental protection. The provisions of the two Acts are curative, preventive, and penal, while Section 133 is only preventive. This means that the two Acts are more comprehensive in their approach to environmental protection and can be used to address a wider range of environmental issues.

The Court's decision also highlights the importance of jurisdiction in environmental cases. The SDM had jurisdiction to act under Section 133 of the Code, and the Court's decision to uphold this jurisdiction is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental cases are heard by the appropriate authorities.

Overall, the Supreme Court's decision in this case is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental laws are enforced effectively and that environmental cases are heard by the appropriate authorities.
