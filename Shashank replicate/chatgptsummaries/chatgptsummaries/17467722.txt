The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Mohan under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with a case registered against him under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that Mohan was found with an Indian Rock python on August 12, 2019, and a case was registered against him.

Mohan's counsel argued that he is a resident of Punjab and there is no possibility of him absconding or tampering with evidence if released on bail. The court allowed the application and directed Mohan to be released on bail on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond and two solvent sureties.

The order will be effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that Mohan will have to appear in court for all hearings and comply with any other conditions set by the court.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including snakes like the Indian Rock python. Violations of the act can result in fines and imprisonment.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested and charged with a crime to be released from custody while they await trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court for all hearings and comply with any other conditions set by the court.

In Mohan's case, the court found that he was not a flight risk and that there was no evidence to suggest that he would tamper with evidence if released on bail. Therefore, the court granted him bail on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond and two solvent sureties.

A personal bond is a promise made by the accused to the court that they will appear for all hearings and comply with any other conditions set by the court. A solvent surety is a person who agrees to pay a certain amount of money to the court if the accused fails to appear in court or violates any other conditions set by the court.

The court's order is effective until the end of the trial, which means that Mohan will have to appear in court for all hearings until the trial is over. If he fails to do so, the bail will become ineffective, and he will be arrested and taken into custody.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a bail application filed by Mohan under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with a case registered against him under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court granted him bail on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond and two solvent sureties. The order will be effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. Mohan will have to appear in court for all hearings and comply with any other conditions set by the court.
