The Patna High Court has issued an order to the competent authority of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board to form a team of officials to visit the areas of Alamganj and Sultanganj in Patna for at least a week. The team is expected to conduct inspections, verify the allegations made in two petitions concerning violation of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and submit a report to the court. The court has set a deadline of December 6, 2017, for the report and affidavit from the competent authority to be filed.

The order comes in response to two petitions filed by residents of Alamganj and Sultanganj, who have alleged that the air quality in their areas has deteriorated significantly due to the presence of polluting industries. The petitioners have claimed that the industries are violating the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and are causing serious health hazards to the residents.

The court has taken note of the seriousness of the allegations and has directed the competent authority to take immediate action. The court has also warned that it will take action as permissible in law if the allegations are found to be true.

The order is significant as it highlights the importance of enforcing environmental laws and regulations. The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution. The act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the act.

The act also provides for the setting up of pollution control committees at the district and local levels, which are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of the act in their respective areas. The act empowers these bodies to take action against polluting industries and to impose penalties for non-compliance.

However, the effectiveness of the act depends on the willingness of the authorities to enforce its provisions. In many cases, the authorities have failed to take action against polluting industries, either due to lack of resources or due to political pressure.

The order of the Patna High Court is a welcome step in this regard, as it sends a strong message to the authorities that they cannot ignore their responsibilities. The court has made it clear that it will not hesitate to take action if the authorities fail to act.

The order is also significant as it highlights the importance of public participation in environmental governance. The petitions filed by the residents of Alamganj and Sultanganj have played a crucial role in bringing the issue to the attention of the court. The court has recognized the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making and has directed the competent authority to take into account the concerns of the residents while conducting the inspections.

The order of the Patna High Court is a positive development in the fight against air pollution. It is a reminder that environmental laws and regulations must be enforced in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens. It is also a reminder that public participation is crucial in ensuring that the authorities are held accountable for their actions.
