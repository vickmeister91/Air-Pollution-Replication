The court order in question pertains to a case involving OPG Power Gujarat Pvt Ltd, which was in the process of setting up a thermal power plant near the village of Bhadreshwar in the Taluka of Mundra, District of Kutch. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, had conveyed to the petitioner that work should not be started on non-forest land until the approval of the Central Government for the release of forest land under the Act had been given. The petitioner challenged this notice and clause 4.4 of the Guidelines on Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, as being ultra vires Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The court order, issued by Justice A.J. Shastri, spans five pages, with the final page featuring the name VC Darji. The court disposed of the case, leaving it open to the petitioner to respond to the show cause notice dated 29.5.2012 by State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

The case centered around the interpretation of clause 4.4 of the Guidelines on Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which states that "no State Government or other authority shall divert any forest land for non-forest purpose without prior approval of the Central Government." The petitioner argued that this clause was unconstitutional as it violated Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all persons. Article 19(1)(g) guarantees the right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The petitioner argued that the requirement for prior approval from the Central Government for the release of forest land for non-forest purposes violated these constitutional provisions.

The court, however, disagreed with the petitioner's arguments and upheld the constitutionality of clause 4.4 of the Guidelines on Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court held that the requirement for prior approval from the Central Government was a reasonable restriction on the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business, and was necessary to protect the environment and forests.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the show cause notice dated 29.5.2012 by State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The court, therefore, left it open to the petitioner to respond to the show cause notice and did not pass any orders in this regard.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case involving the setting up of a thermal power plant near the village of Bhadreshwar in the Taluka of Mundra, District of Kutch. The court upheld the constitutionality of clause 4.4 of the Guidelines on Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for the release of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court disposed of the case, leaving it open to the petitioner to respond to the show cause notice dated 29.5.2012 by State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority.
