In a recent court order signed by Judge P. Sam Koshy, a petition filed by Smt. Roop Kumari Sidar against the State of Chhattisgarh was addressed. The petition challenged the order of confiscation of her car, a Tavera make, bearing registration No. CG-07-LP-8736. The car was allegedly found carrying 115.56 bulk liters of liquor on 11.05.2013, and an offence under the provisions of Chhattisgarh Excise Act was registered against the driver of the vehicle. The Collector, Durg, initiated confiscation proceedings in respect of the said vehicle involved in the commission of the said offence. The petitioner had an agreement with the driver of the vehicle in respect of the vehicle being operated by him on a lease.

The court held that the Collector ought to have waited for the outcome of the criminal case before initiating confiscation proceedings and set aside the order of confiscation. However, the authorities concerned under the Excise Act were given the liberty to proceed for confiscation depending upon the result and outcome of the criminal case pending before the magistrate court.

The court order did not provide any further information about the content of the order. However, it is clear that the court took into consideration the fact that the petitioner had an agreement with the driver of the vehicle in respect of the vehicle being operated by him on a lease. This suggests that the court may have considered the legal implications of such an agreement and whether it had any bearing on the confiscation proceedings.

The court's decision to set aside the order of confiscation and wait for the outcome of the criminal case before proceeding with confiscation is a significant one. It shows that the court is committed to ensuring that due process is followed and that individuals are not deprived of their property without a fair and just legal process.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that individuals are not deprived of their property without a fair and just legal process. It also underscores the need for authorities to exercise caution and wait for the outcome of criminal cases before initiating confiscation proceedings.
