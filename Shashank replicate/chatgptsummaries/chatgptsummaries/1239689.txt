In March 2002, the Supreme Court of India issued a court order in the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors. The case involved a motel that had been granted a lease on ecologically fragile land. The court found that the motel had breached public trust by leasing this land and held them liable for harm caused to the environment. The court ordered the cancellation of the lease and for the area to be restored to its original-natural conditions. The motel was also ordered to pay compensation for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area and to construct a boundary wall to separate the motel building from the river basin.

The court withdrew the notice for payment of pollution fine but directed a fresh notice to be issued to the motel to show cause why exemplary damages be not awarded for having committed the acts set out and detailed in the main judgment. The court considered the imposition of exemplary damages as a deterrent for others not to cause pollution. The court fixed the quantum of exemplary damages payable by the motel at Rupees Ten lakhs only and ordered the amount to be remitted to the State Government for flood protection works in the area affected by the motel's actions.

The court's decision was based on the principle of "polluter pays," which holds that those who cause pollution should bear the costs of cleaning it up. The court found that the motel had caused environmental degradation and had damaged the ecology of the area. The court ordered the motel to pay compensation for restoring the environmental degradation and reversing the damaged ecology.

The court's decision was significant because it recognized the importance of protecting the environment and holding those who cause harm to it accountable. The court's decision also highlighted the need for stricter regulations and enforcement to prevent further harm to the environment.

The court's decision was not without controversy, however. Some argued that the court's decision was too harsh and that it would discourage investment in the country. Others argued that the court's decision was necessary to protect the environment and that it would send a strong message to others who might consider causing harm to the environment.

Overall, the court's decision in the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors was an important step in protecting the environment and holding those who cause harm to it accountable. The decision recognized the importance of the principle of "polluter pays" and highlighted the need for stricter regulations and enforcement to prevent further harm to the environment.
