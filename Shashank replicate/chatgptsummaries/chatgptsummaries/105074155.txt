The court order in question relates to a petition filed by George Kurian, who sought to set aside an order passed by the District & Sessions Judge, Haveri. The petitioner and respondent in this case are a married couple who have fallen apart. The respondent had filed an application for interim maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C., while the petitioner had made an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain records to prove the amount received by the respondent from her son.

The court dismissed the petition and directed the trial judge to consider the application for grant of interim maintenance by taking into consideration any documents produced by the petitioner. This decision was made after considering the arguments put forth by both parties and examining the relevant provisions of the law.

The petitioner had argued that the respondent was not entitled to interim maintenance as she had received a substantial amount of money from her son. He had therefore requested the court to order the production of records to prove this claim. The respondent, on the other hand, had argued that she was entitled to interim maintenance as she was unable to maintain herself and had no other means of support.

The court noted that the purpose of Section 125 Cr.P.C. was to provide for the maintenance of wives, children, and parents who were unable to maintain themselves. It further observed that the provision was intended to be a summary remedy and that the proceedings under it were not intended to be as elaborate as those in a regular suit.

The court also noted that Section 91 Cr.P.C. allowed for the production of documents in certain circumstances, but that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of records in this instance. The court held that the petitioner had failed to establish that the respondent had received a substantial amount of money from her son and that there was no basis for the production of records.

The court therefore dismissed the petition and directed the trial judge to consider the application for interim maintenance by taking into consideration any documents produced by the petitioner. The court emphasized that the trial judge should consider the application in light of the purpose of Section 125 Cr.P.C. and the fact that it was intended to be a summary remedy.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a petition filed by George Kurian seeking to set aside an order passed by the District & Sessions Judge, Haveri. The court dismissed the petition and directed the trial judge to consider the application for interim maintenance by taking into consideration any documents produced by the petitioner. The court emphasized that the trial judge should consider the application in light of the purpose of Section 125 Cr.P.C. and the fact that it was intended to be a summary remedy.
