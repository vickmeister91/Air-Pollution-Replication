The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is a statutory body that is responsible for enforcing environmental laws and regulations in the state of Karnataka. The Chairman of the KSPCB is appointed by the state government and is responsible for overseeing the board's activities. In a recent court order, the appointment of the Chairman of the KSPCB was challenged, leading to a legal dispute.

The appellant in the case was appointed as the Chairman of the KSPCB by the state government. However, he was given notice of cancellation of his nomination due to his retirement on superannuation. The appellant argued that he was entitled to hold office for a period of three years from the date of his nomination, as per the provisions of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board Act, 1974. However, the court held that this provision only applied to a normal case of nomination and not to a case of deputation like the appellant's.

The court observed that the appellant was appointed as Chairman of the KSPCB on deputation from his parent department, the Indian Forest Service. As per the terms of his deputation, the appellant was required to return to his parent department upon completion of his tenure as Chairman of the KSPCB. The court held that the appellant's appointment was not a normal case of nomination, but a case of deputation, and therefore, he was not entitled to hold office for a period of three years from the date of his nomination.

The court also noted that the appellant had ceased to be a government servant upon his retirement on superannuation. As per the provisions of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board Act, 1974, the Chairman of the KSPCB must be a government servant. Therefore, the court held that the appellant had to lay down the office as Chairman upon ceasing to be a government servant.

The court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant, stating that he had no legal right to continue as Chairman of the KSPCB after his retirement on superannuation. The court's decision was based on a strict interpretation of the provisions of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board Act, 1974, and the terms of the appellant's deputation.

The court's decision has significant implications for the functioning of the KSPCB and other statutory bodies in the state of Karnataka. It clarifies the legal position with respect to the appointment of the Chairman of the KSPCB and the tenure of the office. It also underscores the importance of strict adherence to the provisions of the relevant statutes and rules governing the functioning of statutory bodies.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where the appointment of the Chairman of the KSPCB was challenged on the grounds of retirement on superannuation. The court held that the appellant was not entitled to hold office for a period of three years from the date of his nomination, as he was appointed on deputation. The court also held that the appellant had to lay down the office as Chairman upon ceasing to be a government servant. The court's decision has significant implications for the functioning of the KSPCB and other statutory bodies in the state of Karnataka.
