The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner had taken three shop rooms on lease from Anchal Grama Panchayat but had defaulted on payment of monthly rent. The Panchayat had directed the petitioner to pay the arrears of rent with penal interest of 18%, which the petitioner challenged in the writ petition. The court held that the petitioner was liable to pay 12% interest, which is compensatory, and the balance 6% could be considered penal in nature. 

The court directed the petitioner to pay 2/3rd of the balance amount due within one month and file a petition in respect of the 6% penal interest showing adequate reasons for non-payment of the arrears of rent. The first respondent was directed to consider the same and pass appropriate orders. The court has ordered the petitioner to pay 2/3rd of the balance amount due within one month and file a proper petition explaining the reasons for non-payment of the arrears of rent. The first respondent will consider the petition and pass appropriate orders in respect of the balance 6% within one month of receiving payment and the representation.

The case in question involves a dispute between a petitioner and Anchal Grama Panchayat over the payment of rent for three shop rooms that the petitioner had taken on lease. The Panchayat had directed the petitioner to pay the arrears of rent with penal interest of 18%, which the petitioner challenged in the writ petition. The court, after hearing both parties, held that the petitioner was liable to pay 12% interest, which is compensatory, and the balance 6% could be considered penal in nature.

The court directed the petitioner to pay 2/3rd of the balance amount due within one month and file a petition in respect of the 6% penal interest showing adequate reasons for non-payment of the arrears of rent. The first respondent, which is the Anchal Grama Panchayat in this case, was directed to consider the petition and pass appropriate orders in respect of the balance 6% within one month of receiving payment and the representation.

The court's decision is based on the principle of equity and fairness. The court recognized that the petitioner had defaulted on payment of rent and was therefore liable to pay interest on the arrears. However, the court also recognized that the penal interest of 18% was excessive and could be considered punitive in nature. The court, therefore, reduced the interest rate to 12% which is compensatory in nature.

The court also directed the petitioner to pay 2/3rd of the balance amount due within one month. This is a reasonable time frame for the petitioner to make the payment and shows that the court is not being overly harsh on the petitioner. The court also directed the petitioner to file a petition in respect of the 6% penal interest showing adequate reasons for non-payment of the arrears of rent. This is a fair requirement as it allows the petitioner to explain their circumstances and provides an opportunity for the Anchal Grama Panchayat to consider the same and pass appropriate orders.

The court's decision is a balanced one that takes into account the interests of both parties. The petitioner is required to pay the arrears of rent with interest, but the interest rate is reduced to a reasonable level. The petitioner is also given a reasonable time frame to make the payment and an opportunity to explain their circumstances in respect of the penal interest. The Anchal Grama Panchayat is also given an opportunity to consider the petitioner's representation and pass appropriate orders.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a fair and balanced one that takes into account the interests of both parties. The court has reduced the interest rate to a reasonable level and has given the petitioner a reasonable time frame to make the payment. The court has also provided an opportunity for the petitioner to explain their circumstances in respect of the penal interest and for the Anchal Grama Panchayat to consider the same and pass appropriate orders.
