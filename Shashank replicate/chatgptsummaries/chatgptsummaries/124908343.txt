The court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order, and therefore, dismissed the revision petition.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Hemraj Nama and M/S Goyal General Store. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07. However, the Appellate Court dismissed the application, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order.

The petitioner's argument was that the ledger books were necessary to establish the financial transactions of the respondent firm during the relevant period. The petitioner claimed that the respondent firm had committed financial irregularities during the period in question, and the ledger books would provide evidence to support this claim.

However, the court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order. An interlocutory order is an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and does not finally determine the rights of the parties. The court held that the order passed by the Appellate Court was an interlocutory order, and therefore, the revision petition filed by the petitioner was not maintainable.

The court's decision was based on the principle that a revision petition can only be filed against a final order. A final order is an order that finally determines the rights of the parties. In this case, the order passed by the Appellate Court did not finally determine the rights of the parties, as the main case was still pending. Therefore, the court held that the revision petition filed by the petitioner was not maintainable.

The court's decision is in line with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provide for the filing of revision petitions only against final orders. The court's decision also highlights the importance of understanding the nature of an order before filing a revision petition against it.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hemraj Nama against M/S Goyal General Store. The court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order, and therefore, dismissed the revision petition. The court's decision is based on the principle that a revision petition can only be filed against a final order, and highlights the importance of understanding the nature of an order before filing a revision petition against it.
