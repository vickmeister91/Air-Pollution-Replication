The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Tmt. Lakshmiammal against the Deputy Director of Project Tiger, Ambasamudram, Tirunelveli District. The petitioner has sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondent to issue a moving permit for a female elephant named Sita to participate in temple festivals in Kottai Mariamman temple.

The petitioner has contended that Sita has been participating in temple festivals for the past several years and is an integral part of the temple rituals. The petitioner has further argued that the refusal to grant the permit for Sita to participate in the temple festivals is a violation of the fundamental right to practice religion.

The respondent had returned the application for the permit filed by the petitioner on the ground that the elephant was not fit to participate in the temple festivals. The petitioner had challenged this decision of the respondent and had sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondent to grant the permit.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, has directed the respondent to take back the application returned by him and pass appropriate orders, taking into consideration the permit granted by himself for the previous year. The court has further directed the respondent to grant the permit on or before 17.02.2006.

The court has observed that the respondent has not given any valid reason for refusing to grant the permit for Sita to participate in the temple festivals. The court has further noted that the petitioner has produced sufficient evidence to show that Sita has been participating in the temple festivals for the past several years and is an integral part of the temple rituals.

The court has also taken note of the fact that the refusal to grant the permit for Sita to participate in the temple festivals would amount to a violation of the fundamental right to practice religion. The court has, therefore, directed the respondent to grant the permit for Sita to participate in the temple festivals.

In conclusion, the court has ordered the respondent to grant the permit for Sita to participate in the temple festivals in Kottai Mariamman temple. The court has observed that the refusal to grant the permit would amount to a violation of the fundamental right to practice religion. The court has directed the respondent to take back the application returned by him and pass appropriate orders, taking into consideration the permit granted by himself for the previous year. The respondent has been directed to grant the permit on or before 17.02.2006.
