The Melady Karimbu Ulpadhaka Samithi filed a petition against the delay in granting approval for the reconstruction of the Nachivayal Canal, which supplies water for agricultural operations, including sugarcane farming. The canal runs through the Marayoor Sandal Reserve Forest, which is under the control of the Forest Department. The matter will have to be approved by the Government of India under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. 

The petitioners argued that the delay in granting approval for the reconstruction of the canal was causing significant harm to the agricultural operations in the area. They claimed that the canal was in a state of disrepair and needed to be reconstructed to ensure that water could be supplied to the agricultural lands. The petitioners also argued that the Forest Department was not cooperating with them in the matter.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and directed the first and second respondents to see that final approval is ordered within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment. The court noted that the delay in granting approval was causing significant harm to the agricultural operations in the area and that the matter needed to be resolved as soon as possible.

The court also noted that the Forest Department had a duty to cooperate with the petitioners in the matter. The court directed the Forest Department to provide all necessary assistance to the petitioners in obtaining the necessary approvals for the reconstruction of the canal.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that agricultural operations are not unduly affected by delays in obtaining necessary approvals. The court's decision also underscores the importance of cooperation between different government departments in resolving such matters.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of The Melady Karimbu Ulpadhaka Samithi v. The State of Kerala is a welcome development for the agricultural community in the area. The court's decision ensures that the necessary approvals for the reconstruction of the Nachivayal Canal will be granted within a reasonable period of time, thereby ensuring that water can be supplied to the agricultural lands in the area.
