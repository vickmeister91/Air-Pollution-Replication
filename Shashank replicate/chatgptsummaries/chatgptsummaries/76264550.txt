The National Green Tribunal issued a court order on February 6, 2014, in response to three applications related to the adverse impacts of tourism on the ecology and environment of Himachal Pradesh. The order highlights the importance of the state's forests, which constitute about two-thirds of its geographical area and are a vital source of livelihood for residents. The order also notes the negative impacts of unregulated and heavy tourism, including overcrowding, misuse of natural resources, and littering of waste. The order emphasizes the need to identify, measure, and evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of tourism and manage them effectively.

The order also references a report by an expert committee constituted by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh.

The court order discusses the negative impact of tourism and vehicular traffic on the environment and ecology of the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh. The report highlights the increase in pollution levels, reduction in snowfall, and glacial melting due to vehicular emissions and black carbon. The court also notes the adverse effects of deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change on the region's ecosystem. The order emphasizes the need for sustainable tourism and measures to reduce vehicular pollution to protect the fragile ecology of the area.

The court order discusses the fundamental right of citizens to a clean and decent environment, as mandated by the Constitution of India. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife, and the potential harm to human health resulting from development. The court also recognizes the right to a wholesome environment as a fundamental right, and the obligation of the state and citizens to protect and improve it. The court discusses the balance between development and environmental protection, and the need to strike a balance. The court also discusses the significance of environmental protection and the dimensions of the right to a clean and decent environment, as well as the obligation of the state to ensure its fulfillment.

The court order discusses the constitutional obligation of the State to protect the rights of citizens, including the right to freedom of religion and the right to a clean environment.

The court concludes that the State must strike a balance between different activities to ensure the proper enjoyment of the right to life.

The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the right to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court also stresses the need for a balanced approach between development and environmental protection, with the Polluter Pays principle, Precautionary Principle, and Principle of Proportionality being applied. The court specifically addresses the pollution issues in the Rohtang Pass glacier area, highlighting vehicular emissions as a major contributor to pollution and suggesting the implementation of more stringent norms and restrictions on vehicular traffic. The court emphasizes the responsibility of both the government and citizens in restoring and preventing further damage to the environment.

The court order outlines measures to curb vehicular pollution in the eco-sensitive area of Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh, India.

The State Government and all concerned authorities are directed to take immediate and effective measures for reforestation in the area of Kothi, Gulaba, and Marhi.

The court order directs the state government to identify areas for reforestation using remote sensing data and ground verification by the Forest Department. It recommends specific species of trees to be planted at different elevations and emphasizes the need for soil and moisture conservation works and bio-engineering measures to prevent forest fires. The order also emphasizes the "Polluter Pays" principle, holding polluters responsible for environmental damage and requiring them to compensate for the harm caused. The order concludes that these measures are necessary for sustainable development and protection of the environment.

The court order directs all concerned parties to obey the directions given for the sustainable development and protection of the ecological and eco-sensitive area of Rohtang Pass.
