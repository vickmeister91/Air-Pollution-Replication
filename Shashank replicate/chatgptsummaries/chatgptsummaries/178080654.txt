The court order pertains to a case where a claim for relief under the Public Liability Insurance Act was made by a person whose ox died due to electrocution from a live 11 KV wire. The petitioner argued that electricity is not a hazardous substance and therefore, the Collector was not justified in allowing the claim. However, the court held that electricity is a hazardous substance and falls under the definition of "handling" as per the Act. Therefore, the claim for relief was valid under the Act of 1991. The court also noted that the Act provides for liability to give relief in certain cases on the principle of no fault.

The Public Liability Insurance Act of 1991 was enacted to provide for public liability insurance for the purpose of providing immediate relief to the persons affected by accidents occurring while handling any hazardous substance. The Act defines "handling" as the manufacture, processing, treatment, package, storage, transportation, use, collection, destruction, conversion, offering for sale, transfer or the like of any hazardous substance. The Act also defines "hazardous substance" as any substance or preparation which is defined as hazardous under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and includes any substance which, if not handled properly, can cause harm to human beings, other living creatures, plants, microorganisms, property or the environment.

In the case at hand, the petitioner argued that electricity is not a hazardous substance and therefore, the Collector was not justified in allowing the claim for relief. However, the court held that electricity is a hazardous substance and falls under the definition of "handling" as per the Act. The court noted that electricity can cause harm to human beings, other living creatures, plants, microorganisms, property or the environment if not handled properly. Therefore, the claim for relief was valid under the Act of 1991.

The court also noted that the Act provides for liability to give relief in certain cases on the principle of no fault. This means that the liability to give relief is not dependent on proving fault or negligence on the part of the enterprise. The Act provides for relief to be given in cases where an accident results in death, injury, or damage to property. The court held that the claim for relief in this case was valid under the Act as the ox had died due to electrocution from a live 11 KV wire.

The court order also discusses the concept of strict liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries. The court states that in such cases, the enterprise has an absolute duty to ensure the highest standards of safety and is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those affected by any accidents. This liability is not subject to exceptions and must be correlated to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise. The liability is known as "strict liability" and differs from liability arising from negligence.

The court upholds the decision of the Collector to allow the claim for relief. The court notes that the Collector had considered all the relevant factors and had come to a reasoned decision. The court also notes that the Collector had followed the procedure laid down under the Act and had given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where a claim for relief under the Public Liability Insurance Act was made by a person whose ox died due to electrocution from a live 11 KV wire. The court held that electricity is a hazardous substance and falls under the definition of "handling" as per the Act. Therefore, the claim for relief was valid under the Act of 1991. The court also discussed the concept of strict liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries and upheld the decision of the Collector to allow the claim for relief. The court noted that the Collector had considered all the relevant factors and had followed the procedure laid down under the Act.
