The Allahabad High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Ram Sagar and others against the State of Uttar Pradesh and others. The petitioners were appointed on various dates from 1979 to 1995 and continued in service in the Uttar Pradesh Swatantra Senani Kalyan Sansthan, which is an autonomous body wholly financed by the State Government. The society exercises all disciplinary control over the employees, and the bye-laws of the society do not contemplate that regularisation process is to be undertaken by the State Government. The petitioners sought regularisation of their services, which was refused by the opposite parties on the ground that the petitioners are not Government servants.

The court found that the society is fully aided by the State Government, and the parameters applicable to State Government employees are also applicable to the petitioners. The court quashed the order dated 24.9.2008 and directed the society to consider the case of the petitioners for regularisation in accordance with the observations made in the body of the judgment.

Regularisation of services is a process by which temporary or contractual employees are made permanent in their jobs. The petitioners in this case were seeking regularisation of their services in the Uttar Pradesh Swatantra Senani Kalyan Sansthan, which is an autonomous body wholly financed by the State Government. The society exercises all disciplinary control over the employees, and the bye-laws of the society do not contemplate that regularisation process is to be undertaken by the State Government.

The petitioners were appointed on various dates from 1979 to 1995 and continued in service in the society. However, their services were not regularised, and they were not considered as Government servants. The opposite parties refused to regularise their services on the ground that they were not Government servants.

The court found that the society is fully aided by the State Government, and the parameters applicable to State Government employees are also applicable to the petitioners. The court quashed the order dated 24.9.2008 and directed the society to consider the case of the petitioners for regularisation in accordance with the observations made in the body of the judgment.

The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the rights of temporary or contractual employees to seek regularisation of their services. The court found that the society is fully aided by the State Government, and the parameters applicable to State Government employees are also applicable to the petitioners. This means that the petitioners are entitled to the same benefits and protections as State Government employees.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that autonomous bodies that are wholly financed by the State Government follow the same rules and regulations as State Government employees. This ensures that employees of such bodies are not discriminated against and are entitled to the same benefits and protections as State Government employees.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision in the writ petition filed by Ram Sagar and others against the State of Uttar Pradesh and others is a significant one as it recognizes the rights of temporary or contractual employees to seek regularisation of their services. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that autonomous bodies that are wholly financed by the State Government follow the same rules and regulations as State Government employees. This ensures that employees of such bodies are not discriminated against and are entitled to the same benefits and protections as State Government employees.
