In the first court order, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had filed a complaint against M/s. Krishna Agencies and Sarang Walia for using, storing, and selling goods in plastic bags, which was prohibited by a notification issued by the Lieutenant Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi. The accused pleaded not guilty, and after a trial, they were acquitted on November 15, 2018. The court heard evidence from witnesses, including the inspection team and the complainant, and the accused denied the allegations and intended to lead defense evidence.

The second court order pertains to a case where the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had filed a case against Krishna Agencies for using plastic bags in violation of a notification dated 07.01.09. The court examined the witnesses presented by both parties and noted that the recovery witnesses had seized 43 poly bags instead of 40 as claimed. The bags were not sent for testing to determine if they were indeed prohibited under the notification. The court also noted that the procedure for taking samples under the Environment (Protection) Act had not been followed. The court ultimately found that the complainant had not proved that the bags seized were prohibited and acquitted the accused.

The third court order states that the Central Government or any empowered officer has the power to take samples of air, water, soil, or other substances from any factory or premises for analysis. The results of the analysis cannot be used as evidence unless the proper procedure is followed, including serving notice to the occupier or agent, collecting a sample in their presence, and sending the sample to a recognized laboratory. The court found that the procedure was not followed in the case of the accused, who were charged with using prohibited polythene bags. The court also noted that the prosecution failed to prove the type and quality of the bags seized and that the accused's statement about the bags could not be considered an admission. The court emphasized the importance of following proper procedure in such cases and acquitted the accused.

In the fourth court order, the court stated that in criminal cases, the law should be interpreted strictly to protect the life and liberty of individuals. The judgment cited by the complainant's counsel is not applicable to the present case as it has already undergone a complete trial. The accused has provided relevant provisions of law and certain correspondences between the accused and the complainant, but they have no relevance to the present complaint. The witnesses have admitted that the alleged polythene bags were easily available in the market and did not have the name or signature of the accused. Therefore, the court is satisfied that the complainant has failed to prove the allegations against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and they are acquitted of the charges.

In all four court orders, the accused were acquitted of the charges against them. The court emphasized the importance of following proper procedure in such cases and noted that the prosecution failed to prove the allegations against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The court also stated that in criminal cases, the law should be interpreted strictly to protect the life and liberty of individuals. The court orders highlight the need for proper evidence and procedure to be followed in cases of alleged violations of environmental laws.
