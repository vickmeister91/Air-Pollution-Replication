In a recent court order, a petitioner filed a Public Interest writ petition to make the Narmada river free of pollution for drinking and irrigation purposes. However, the court has transferred the case to the Bhopal Bench of the National Green Tribunal as the relief sought falls under the jurisdiction of environmental and water pollution laws. The case has been disposed of.

The petitioner's plea was to make the Narmada river free of pollution for drinking and irrigation purposes. The Narmada river is one of the largest rivers in India, and it is a major source of water for drinking and irrigation purposes. The petitioner argued that the pollution of the river was causing harm to the environment and the health of the people who depend on it.
