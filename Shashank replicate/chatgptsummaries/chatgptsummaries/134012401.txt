The court found the defendants jointly and severally liable to pay the outstanding amount of Rs.4,27,931/- with interest at 9% per annum. The court held that the defendant had failed to discharge his obligation to repay the loan, and that the plaintiff bank was entitled to recover the outstanding amount along with interest.

The court order highlights the importance of fulfilling one's obligations under a loan agreement. The defendant in this case failed to repay the loan despite several reminders, and also resorted to fraudulent means to obtain another loan from the same bank. Such actions not only violate the terms of the loan agreement but also constitute a breach of trust between the borrower and the lender.

The court's decision to hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for the outstanding amount is significant. This means that both defendants are equally responsible for repaying the loan, and the plaintiff bank can recover the entire amount from either defendant. This is a common practice in cases where multiple parties are involved in a loan agreement.

The court also awarded the costs of the suit to the plaintiff bank. This means that the defendant will have to bear the expenses incurred by the plaintiff bank in pursuing the case. The costs of the suit can include legal fees, court fees, and other expenses related to the litigation.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Punjab National Bank versus Shri Surender Kumar Nimesh highlights the importance of fulfilling one's obligations under a loan agreement. The court's decision to hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for the outstanding amount, along with the award of costs to the plaintiff bank, sends a strong message to borrowers who fail to repay their loans. It is essential for borrowers to honor their commitments and maintain the trust of their lenders.
