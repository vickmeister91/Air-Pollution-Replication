The details of the petitions are not provided in the summary.

The second case involves a writ petition filed by a shopping center in Solapur against various government entities and a sugar factory. The petitioners are seeking relief from pollution caused by the factory and are requesting that the government take action to address the issue. The respondents include the state of Maharashtra, the commissioner of sugar, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and others. The court order lists the parties involved and sets a date for the next hearing.

The third case lists several cases involving petitioners and respondents, including a public interest litigation and multiple writ petitions. The respondents include government officials and a sugar company. Summons are to be served to various parties under the Code of Civil Procedure. No details are provided about the specific issues being addressed in these cases.

The fourth case involves multiple parties and petitions, including a writ petition filed by Mr. Shankar Baburao Vyavahare against the State of Maharashtra and various government departments and officials. The judgment was reserved on December 6, 2017, and pronounced on March 16, 2018. The details of the case and the ruling are not provided in the summary.

The fifth case pertains to multiple petitions and a public interest litigation filed against Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Limited by Lokshakti Sugar and Allied Industries Ltd, Grampanchayat Aashti, Mahavir Digambar Aware, Siddeshwar Navnad Wagaz, and Shankar Baburao Vyavahare. The petitions challenge the grant of aerial distance certificate and the license granted to Audumbarraoji, and seek to stop construction of their sugar factory. The court has heard all the petitions together and disposed of them with a common judgment. The order also provides a chronology of events leading up to the petitions.

The sixth case pertains to a dispute over the construction of a sugar factory on land in village Aashti. The Grampanchayat Aashti filed a petition seeking to stop all construction activity, and a public interest litigation was also filed challenging the license granted to the factory. The court initially restrained the factory from continuing construction without proper permissions, but later allowed construction to resume after the Collector, Solapur examined all the necessary permissions. However, objections were raised regarding the factory's location and certification, leading to further legal challenges. The court order includes provisions related to the minimum distance required between sugar factories and the steps required to set up a new factory.

The seventh case outlines the requirements for filing an Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum, including obtaining a certificate from the relevant state government authority regarding the distance between the proposed factory and existing sugar factories. The order also specifies steps that must be taken, such as placing orders for plant and machinery, commencing civil work, and obtaining term loans. The order sets a time limit for implementation and consequences for non-compliance, including forfeiture of a performance guarantee. The court will consider objections to a license granted to Audumbarraoji in light of these provisions. The petitioner argues that Lokshakti's application for an aerial distance certificate should have been granted as it was submitted first, but the Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice and invited objections, including from Audumbarraoji.

The eighth case pertains to the grant of an aerial distance certificate to sugar factories in Maharashtra. The Commissioner of Sugar had issued a public notice inviting objections for the grant of the certificate to Lokshakti, which Audumbarraoji objected to. The court found that both Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji had applied for the certificate, but the former's application was rejected due to an interim order. After the order was modified, both factories applied again, and Audumbarraoji's application was granted without objections, while Lokshakti's was rejected. The court found that Audumbarraoji's application was made earlier and that the change of name from Gopal Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited to Audumbarraoji was legal. Therefore, the court upheld the grant of the certificate to Audumbarraoji.

The ninth case discusses various applications and petitions related to the grant of aerial distance certificates and the construction of sugar factories. The court finds that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one party and refusing it to another based on the timing of their applications and objections raised. The court also discusses the validity of an Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM) and whether effective steps were taken within the stipulated time for the construction of a sugar factory. The court ultimately finds that the petitions have no merit.

The tenth case discusses a case involving a sugar factory and its change of location. The court considers a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking implementation of a circular regarding the construction of sugar factories and the distance between them. The court finds that the PIL is premature as the factory in question has not yet commenced its crushing season. The court also considers the issue of the factory's change of location and whether effective steps
