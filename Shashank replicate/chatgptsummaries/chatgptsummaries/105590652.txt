The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Bharat Parikh and Co, challenging an order issued by the Range Forest Officer stating that the petitioner's mining activities in a reserved forest without prior permission constitute a violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The petitioner argued that the subject land was not a reserved forest as declared under Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act, and relied on a previous court decision. 

The court observed that the impugned order was based solely on the notification issued under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act, and quashed the notice. The court did not make any adjudication on the issue of whether the subject land was a forest land within the meaning of the said Act of 1980.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a central legislation that seeks to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval of the central government. The Act defines "forest land" as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and includes any land which is notified as forest land by the central government or the state government.

The Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, is a state legislation that provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act defines "reserved forest" as any forest or waste land which is notified as such by the state government. The Act also provides for the constitution of a Forest Settlement Officer, who is responsible for the demarcation and settlement of forest lands.

In the present case, the petitioner argued that the subject land was not a reserved forest as declared under Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act. Section 4 of the Act empowers the state government to declare any forest land or waste land as a reserved forest. The petitioner relied on a previous court decision, which held that the subject land was not a reserved forest.

The court observed that the impugned order was based solely on the notification issued under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the state government to notify any land as a reserved forest. The court held that the impugned order did not take into account the previous court decision, which held that the subject land was not a reserved forest. The court quashed the notice issued by the Range Forest Officer.

However, the court did not make any adjudication on the issue of whether the subject land was a forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Act defines "forest land" as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and includes any land which is notified as forest land by the central government or the state government. The court did not examine whether the subject land was recorded as forest in the government records or whether it was notified as forest land by the central government or the state government.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Bharat Parikh and Co, challenging an order issued by the Range Forest Officer stating that the petitioner's mining activities in a reserved forest without prior permission constitute a violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court observed that the impugned order was based solely on the notification issued under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act, and quashed the notice. However, the court did not make any adjudication on the issue of whether the subject land was a forest land within the meaning of the said Act of 1980.
