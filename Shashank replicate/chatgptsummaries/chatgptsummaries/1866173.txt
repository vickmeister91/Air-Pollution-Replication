The Central Information Commission recently heard a case in which an appellant requested information regarding the Charter of Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Protection (CREP). The appellant had submitted a Right to Information (RTI) request seeking information on 28 points related to the implementation of CREP guidelines by industries. However, the Public Authority had denied access to the information on the grounds that it was exempted under Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act, which pertains to commercial confidence and trade secrets.

The Commission noted that the CREP guidelines were voluntary in nature and that industries were not required to comply with them. Therefore, 19 of the appellant's 28 points were rendered redundant. The Commission directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) to provide access to information requested in six specific points of the RTI request. However, the Commission also stated that the Public Authority was not obligated to provide answers to queries with "what" as the prefix.

The Commission's decision highlights the importance of understanding the nature of voluntary guidelines and their implementation by industries. While voluntary guidelines may provide a framework for responsible corporate behavior, they do not have the force of law and are not enforceable. Therefore, it is important for citizens to understand the limitations of such guidelines and to seek information on their implementation in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the RTI Act.

The Commission's decision also underscores the importance of framing RTI requests in a manner that is specific and relevant to the information sought. In this case, the Commission found that many of the appellant's points were redundant because they were not relevant to the implementation of CREP guidelines by industries. Therefore, it is important for citizens to frame their RTI requests in a manner that is specific and relevant to the information sought, in order to avoid the rejection of their requests on technical grounds.

Overall, the Commission's decision in this case provides important guidance on the implementation of voluntary guidelines by industries and the framing of RTI requests in a manner that is specific and relevant to the information sought. It underscores the importance of understanding the limitations of voluntary guidelines and seeking information on their implementation in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the RTI Act.
