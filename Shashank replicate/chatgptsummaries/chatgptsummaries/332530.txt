The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard three writ petitions related to illegal mining activities in the state and the requirement of environmental clearances and NOCs for quarry operations of sand and 'bajri'. The petitioner in W.P. No.1574/2008 alleged that there is gross dereliction in the enforcement of environmental provisions by the respondents, and a high level independent inquiry is required. The respondents argued that the writ petition suffers from the vice of non-joinder of necessary parties and no material has been brought on record to show that quarrying operation of sand and 'bajri' causes environmental pollution. The validity of Rule 49 of the 1996 Rules, which gives exemption from taking environmental clearance, is challenged in W.P. No.13329/2009. The Madhya Pradesh State Mining Corporation Ltd. filed W.P. No.13118/2009 against the letters/orders of the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee, State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, and M.P. State Pollution Control Board, which asked the petitioner to obtain environmental clearances and NOCs.

The court order states that the challenge to the validity of Rule 49 of the 1996 Rules is misconceived. Sand and 'bajri' mines have been exempted from obtaining environmental clearance as they are surface deposits and do not involve any mining activity. The State Government has framed the 1996 Rules under Section 15(1-A) of MMDR Act, which is within its legislative competence. The court also heard arguments regarding the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the notification dated 14.9.2006, which prescribes the requirement of obtaining prior environmental clearance for mining operations in respect of sand and 'bajri'. The State Government has exempted sand and 'bajri' quarry from the requirement of obtaining environmental clearance. The court heard arguments from both sides regarding the applicability of the notification to quarrying of sand and 'bajri'.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Notification dated 14.9.2006 and the requirement of obtaining environmental clearance for quarrying operations of sand and 'bajri'. The court examines relevant provisions of law, including the MMDR Act and other laws pertaining to the protection of the environment and natural resources. The court notes that Rule 49 of the 1996 Rules exempts quarrying of sand and 'bajri' from the provisions of environmental protection laws, but ultimately concludes that environmental clearance is required for quarrying operations of sand and 'bajri' due to the potential for environmental pollution. The court also notes the duty of every holder of a quarry lease to take precautions for the protection of the environment and control of pollution while conducting quarrying operations.

The court order discusses various rules and regulations related to quarrying operations, including the reclamation and rehabilitation of lands, precautions against damage to public places, air pollution, and noise pollution. It also examines the applicability of Rule 49 of the 1996 Rules, which exempts sand and 'bajri' quarrying from certain environmental protection provisions, in light of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court concludes that Rule 49 does not fall within the meaning of the expression "enactment" and, therefore, the non-obstante clause contained in Section 24(1) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 does not apply to it.

The court order discusses the conflict between two acts, the MMDR Act and the Environment (Protection) Act, regarding the regulation of minor minerals. The court concludes that the later enactment, Section 15(1A) of the MMDR Act, should prevail over the earlier one, the Environment (Protection) Act, and that the notification under Rule 5(3) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 does not apply to quarrying operations of sand and 'bajri' in view of Rule 49(1) of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996. The court also notes that sand and 'bajri' are exempted from environmental clearance requirements and that the State Legislature has treated them as a different class of minor mineral. The court dismisses two writ petitions and allows one, quashing certain letter/orders.

In summary, the Madhya Pradesh High Court heard three writ petitions related to illegal mining activities in the state and the requirement of environmental clearances and NOCs for quarry operations of sand and 'bajri'. The court examined relevant provisions of law, including the MMDR Act and other laws pertaining to the protection of the environment and natural resources. The court concluded that environmental clearance is required for quarrying operations of sand and 'bajri' due to the potential for environmental pollution. The court also noted the duty of every holder of a quarry lease to take precautions for the protection of the environment and control of pollution while conducting quarrying operations. The court dismissed two writ petitions and allowed one, quashing certain letter/orders.
