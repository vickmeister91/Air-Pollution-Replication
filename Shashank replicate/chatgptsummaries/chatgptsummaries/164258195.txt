Smt. Kalawati Devi had filed an appeal against an eviction order passed by the Estate Officer, DSIIDC Ltd, in respect of Shed No.3-X, Nangloi-48-DS, Community Work Centre, DSIIDC, New Delhi. The appellant had argued that the Estate Officer had violated the principles of natural justice and that she was not an unauthorized occupant. However, the respondent did not file a reply to the appeal, but opposed it.

The court found that the terms and conditions of the hire-purchase agreement had been violated by the original allottee and that the appellant was in unauthorized occupation of the premises in question. As a result, the appeal was dismissed.

The court order pertains to a case between Smt. Kalawati Devi and D.S.I.I.D.C. in Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi. Unfortunately, the details of the case and the ruling are not provided in the summary. The order is the last page of the document and is numbered as page 8 out of 8.

It is clear from the summary that Smt. Kalawati Devi had been occupying Shed No.3-X, Nangloi-48-DS, Community Work Centre, DSIIDC, New Delhi. However, the Estate Officer had passed an eviction order against her, which she had appealed against. She had argued that the Estate Officer had violated the principles of natural justice and that she was not an unauthorized occupant.

The court, however, found that the terms and conditions of the hire-purchase agreement had been violated by the original allottee and that the appellant was in unauthorized occupation of the premises in question. This means that Smt. Kalawati Devi did not have the legal right to occupy the premises and was therefore in violation of the agreement.

It is unfortunate that the details of the case and the ruling are not provided in the summary. However, it is clear that the court had found in favor of the respondent, D.S.I.I.D.C., and had dismissed the appeal filed by Smt. Kalawati Devi.

This case highlights the importance of abiding by the terms and conditions of any agreement or contract. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against the violator, as seen in this case. It is also important to note that the principles of natural justice must be followed in any legal proceedings to ensure a fair and just outcome.
