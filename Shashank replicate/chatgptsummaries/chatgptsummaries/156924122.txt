The court order in question pertains to a revision petition that was filed to challenge an order passed by the trial court. The petitioner had requested the trial court to re-examine two witnesses, but the court had declined the prayer. The revision petition was filed against this order.

The court, however, held that the revision against the order passed by the trial court was not maintainable as it was an interlocutory order. An interlocutory order is an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and is not a final order. The court stated that the petitioner could not challenge an interlocutory order through a revision petition.

The court also noted that the material questions were not highlighted in the application filed before the trial court. The petitioner had not provided sufficient reasons for the trial court to re-examine the witnesses. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for re-examination of the witnesses.

Based on these observations, the court dismissed the revision petition. The petitioner's request for re-examination of the witnesses was not granted.

This court order highlights the importance of highlighting material questions in applications filed before a court. It also emphasizes the need to understand the nature of orders passed by a court. Interlocutory orders cannot be challenged through revision petitions, and it is important to keep this in mind while filing petitions before a court.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to litigants to be diligent in their approach to court proceedings. It is important to provide sufficient reasons and evidence to support any requests made before a court. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of petitions and the loss of valuable time and resources.
