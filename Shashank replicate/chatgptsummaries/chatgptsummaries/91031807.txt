The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various criminal petitions filed under different sections of the Indian Penal Code. The first court order pertains to two criminal petitions filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the order of registering the P.C. as C.C. against the petitioner and quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.579/2012 (P.C. No.267/2012) on the file of the Prl. Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) & JMFC, Dharwad, insofar as the same relate to the petitioner as the same being totally illegal and not sustainable in law. The petitioners are accused in the trial court, and the respondents are the complainants. The Act of 2002 was enacted with a view to provide for conservation of biological diversity sustainable use of its components and equitable sharing of the benefits assigning out of the biological resources, knowledge and for matters connected their with or incidental to both these.

The second court order pertains to a complaint filed by respondents alleging that the accused parties entered into agreements to develop and distribute genetically modified eggplants without proper approval. The petitioners challenge the validity of the complaint on various grounds, including that the complainants do not have the authority to file such a complaint and that the agreements were approved by higher authorities. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the validity of the complaint.

The third court order states that the Act of 2002 does not apply to collaborative research projects under Section 5 of the Act, and therefore, there is no justification for filing a complaint for contravention of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. The complaint was filed by authorized officers who have the authority to file such complaints, and there is no bar for initiating complaints against non-public servants. The court also clarifies the capacity and authority of the complainants and states that the complaint has to be treated as a complaint by a public servant. The court also discusses the need for sanction to prosecute a public servant and refers to Section 27 of the Act of 2009 regarding the Vice-Chancellor's position.

The fourth court order states that the Chancellor of a university has the authority to remove the Vice-Chancellor if it appears that their continuation is detrimental to the interest of the university. The Chancellor must hold an inquiry, conducted by a person who is or has been a Judge of the High Court, nominated by the Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor and Registrar of the university cannot claim protection under Section 197 Cr.P.C. in the event of any charges under the Penal Provisions. The order also explains the meaning of "legal proceeding" under Section 64 of the Act of 2009, which provides protection to the university or its authorities, bodies, officers, or other employees for anything done in good faith. The court concludes that criminal proceedings are also legal proceedings under this provision.

The fifth court order discusses the interpretation of Section 64 of the Act of 2009 and whether it provides protection to the University or its officers in criminal proceedings. The court concludes that the provision does include criminal proceedings and gives protection to those who act in good faith. However, the defense of good faith can only be considered by the trial court at an appropriate stage and cannot be used to quash proceedings at the stage of taking cognizance. The order also discusses the ABSP-II Project and the transfer of transgenic brinjal varieties from accused No.5 to the petitioners University for research and development purposes.

The sixth court order pertains to a violation of Section 4 of the Act of 2002, which requires approval from the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) for the transfer of biological resources occurring in or obtained from India for monetary consideration or otherwise to any non-Indian citizen or non-Indian body corporate or organization. The accused No.5, an Indian company with non-Indian participation in its share capital, transferred transgenic brinjal varieties containing Cry1Ac gene to the petitioners without seeking prior approval from the NBA. The court rejected the petitioners' argument that they were implementing the directions of higher authorities and clarified that the Act of 2002 applies to biological resources used as a source for research or industrial purposes. The court also noted that the eggplant or brinjal is exempted from the Act of 2002 only for export purposes and not for research or industrial purposes.

The seventh court order discusses the exemption of GMOs covered under the EPA 1986 from requiring previous approval for export, but clarifies that previous approval is required if the GMO is used for research or industrial purposes. The order also discusses the conditions for exemption from the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 2002 for collaborative research projects, which include conforming to policy guidelines issued by the Central Government and obtaining approval from the Central Government. The court finds that the petitioners did not comply with these conditions and therefore cannot seek exemption from the provisions of Section 4 of the Act of 2002. The court also finds that the petitioners violated Section 4 of the Act of 2002 by transferring biological resources without prior approval from the NBA. The petitions are dismissed.

In summary, these court orders pertain to various criminal petitions filed under different sections of the Indian Penal Code. The court has heard arguments from both sides and has made decisions on the validity
