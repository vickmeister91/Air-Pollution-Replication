The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed against the appointment of a dealer for a retail outlet in Dhakuakhana, Assam by Reliance Industries Ltd. The petitioner argued that the appointment was made without following a transparent procedure and that the local population was not given an opportunity for employment. The respondents argued that RIL is a private company and not subject to government policy, and that the appointment of a dealer is a private contract. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses the issue of whether RIL and RPM, two private companies, can be considered "other authorities" under Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The court concludes that they cannot, as they are not created by statute and do not have pervasive control by the government. However, the court notes that under Article 226, the High Court can issue writs to any person or authority, including private companies, if they are performing a public duty or violating statutory provisions.

The court order also discusses the circumstances under which a writ can be issued to private bodies or companies. It states that a writ may not be issued if there is no non-compliance with or violation of any statutory provision by the private body. The order also explains that a private body or person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may become necessary to compel such body or association to enforce any statutory obligation or such obligations of public nature casting positive obligation upon it. 

The court concludes that the appointment of a dealer cannot be construed to be a public function of a private authority and therefore dismisses the writ petition. The court notes that the appointment of a dealer is a private contract and that RIL is not subject to government policy in this regard. The court also notes that the appointment of a dealer does not involve any statutory obligation or obligation of public nature casting positive obligation upon RIL. Therefore, the court finds that RIL is not amenable to writ jurisdiction in this matter.

The court's decision in this case highlights the limitations of writ jurisdiction over private companies. While private companies may be subject to writ jurisdiction if they are performing a public duty or violating statutory provisions, the court's decision in this case makes it clear that the appointment of a dealer by a private company does not fall under either of these categories. 

The court's decision also underscores the importance of transparency and fairness in the appointment of dealers by private companies. While RIL may not be subject to government policy in this regard, it is still important for private companies to follow transparent procedures and provide opportunities for local populations to be employed. Failure to do so may result in public backlash and legal challenges, even if the company is not subject to writ jurisdiction. 

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the scope of writ jurisdiction over private companies and the importance of transparency and fairness in the appointment of dealers by private companies. While private companies may not be subject to government policy in this regard, they should still strive to follow best practices and ensure that their actions are in line with public expectations.
