Madan Lal, who has been in custody for the last seven months for a wildlife protection act and IPC offense, has been granted bail by the court. The court has ordered his release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, and the latest amendment was made in 2006.

Madan Lal was arrested for violating the Wildlife Protection Act and IPC offense. The IPC offense could be related to any criminal offense under the Indian Penal Code. The exact nature of the offense is not clear from the court order summary.

The court has granted bail to Madan Lal, which means that he will be released from custody. Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody until their trial. The person who is granted bail has to provide a certain amount of money or property as a guarantee that they will appear in court when required.

In this case, Madan Lal has been asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each. A personal bond is a promise made by the accused to the court that they will appear in court when required. A surety bond is a promise made by a third party, usually a family member or friend, that they will ensure that the accused appears in court when required.

The court has also stipulated that Madan Lal has to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This means that he cannot miss any court hearings and has to be present in court whenever required.

The court order summary does not provide any details about the nature of the offense committed by Madan Lal. However, it is clear that the court has found it appropriate to grant him bail. The court may have taken into consideration various factors such as the severity of the offense, the evidence against Madan Lal, his past criminal record, and his likelihood of fleeing from justice.

In conclusion, Madan Lal has been granted bail by the court after being in custody for the last seven months for a wildlife protection act and IPC offense. He has been asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each and has to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.
