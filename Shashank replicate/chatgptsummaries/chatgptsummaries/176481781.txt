The court order in question pertains to a criminal case against Ashok Parihar, who was facing corruption charges. Parihar had filed a petition challenging the rejection of his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. in Original Criminal Case No.42/2010. He had requested the summoning of documents related to the grant of sanction for prosecution against him. However, the court examined the impugned order and the statement of witness PW1 and found that the trial court had exercised its discretion judiciously in declining the prayer of the petitioner. As a result, the court dismissed the petition summarily.

The case against Parihar was related to allegations of corruption during his tenure as a government official. The prosecution had alleged that Parihar had accepted bribes in exchange for granting contracts to certain individuals. The case had been ongoing for several years, and Parihar had been trying to get access to certain documents that he believed would help his case.

In his petition, Parihar had argued that the trial court had erred in rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. According to him, the documents he had requested were crucial to his defense, and he had a right to access them. However, the court disagreed with his arguments and found that the trial court had acted appropriately in declining his request.

The court examined the impugned order and found that the trial court had considered all the relevant factors before rejecting Parihar's application. The trial court had noted that the documents Parihar had requested were not relevant to the case and that their production would only delay the proceedings. The court also noted that Parihar had not provided any specific reasons for why he needed the documents and how they would help his case.

The court also examined the statement of witness PW1, who had testified in the case. The court found that PW1 had not mentioned anything about the documents Parihar had requested and that their production was not necessary for the fair and just disposal of the case.

Based on these findings, the court concluded that the trial court had exercised its discretion judiciously in declining Parihar's request. The court noted that the right to access documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was not an absolute right and that it was subject to certain limitations. The court also noted that the trial court had considered all the relevant factors before rejecting Parihar's application and that there was no reason to interfere with its decision.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed Parihar's petition summarily. The court's decision was a blow to Parihar's defense, as it meant that he would not be able to access the documents he had requested. However, it also reaffirmed the principle that the right to access documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was not absolute and that it was subject to certain limitations.
