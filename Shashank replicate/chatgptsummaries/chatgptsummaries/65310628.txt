Alla Rakkha, also known as Littu, filed a bail application under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. as he feared arrest in a case registered against him and eight others for killing wild animal Pangolins in mass scale and selling their skins in the black market, which is prohibited under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The applicant's counsel argued that he was falsely implicated and had no criminal antecedents, while the prosecution argued that there was enough evidence against him. The court rejected the bail application without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.

The case against Alla Rakkha and his co-accused was registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which prohibits the killing of wild animals and the sale of their skins in the black market. The act was enacted to protect the country's wildlife and prevent their extinction. The killing of Pangolins, which are an endangered species, is a serious offense under the act, and the accused could face imprisonment for up to seven years.

Alla Rakkha filed a bail application under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C., which allows a person to seek anticipatory bail if he fears arrest in a non-bailable offense. The applicant's counsel argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and had no criminal antecedents. The counsel also argued that the prosecution had not produced any evidence against the applicant and that he was willing to cooperate with the investigation.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that there was enough evidence against the applicant and that he was a key player in the illegal trade of Pangolin skins. The prosecution also argued that if the applicant was granted bail, he could tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses.

The court, after hearing both sides, rejected the bail application without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. The court observed that the case was serious in nature, and the accused could face imprisonment for up to seven years if convicted. The court also observed that the applicant was a key player in the illegal trade of Pangolin skins, and if granted bail, he could tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses.

The court's decision to reject the bail application is in line with the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which aims to protect the country's wildlife and prevent their extinction. The act provides for stringent punishment for those who violate its provisions, and the court's decision sends a strong message to those involved in the illegal trade of wildlife.

In conclusion, Alla Rakkha's bail application was rejected by the court, and he will have to face the trial in the case registered against him and his co-accused. The case highlights the need for strict enforcement of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, to protect the country's wildlife and prevent their extinction. The court's decision to reject the bail application is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal.
