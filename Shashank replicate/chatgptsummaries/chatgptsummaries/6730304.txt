The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition against an order passed by a lower court in a case related to an offence punishable under Section 15 of The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioners had been charged by the trial court based on a complaint sent by someone to the police station. The petitioners argued that there was no material on record against them to raise a grave suspicion about their involvement in the offence.

The court found weight in the contention of the petitioners' counsel that the charge had not been properly framed. However, the court noted that the trial court had the power to alter or add any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced. The court set aside the impugned order and directed the trial court to pass a reasoned order after hearing both parties to frame or not to frame the charge.
