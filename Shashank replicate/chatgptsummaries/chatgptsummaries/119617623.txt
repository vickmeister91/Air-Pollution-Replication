In September 2013, the National Green Tribunal heard a case involving A.T. Yuvaraj and Rani Chemicals regarding air and water pollution caused by the manufacturing of bleaching liquid and plastic and rag pulp. The 1st respondent, A.T. Yuvaraj, was found to be violating the Air and Water Acts and storing 60 chlorine cylinders without approval. The 2nd respondent, Rani Chemicals, was also found to be letting out untreated effluents. As a result, both respondents were ordered to obtain appropriate licenses and approvals and not to operate until then.

The units were sealed by the authorities on August 24, 2013, and were found to be in locked and sealed condition and not in operation on August 30, 2013. The court order was disposed of, and no costs were awarded. The order was issued by Justice M. Chockalingam and Prof. Dr. R. Nagendran on September 4th, 2013 in Chennai.
