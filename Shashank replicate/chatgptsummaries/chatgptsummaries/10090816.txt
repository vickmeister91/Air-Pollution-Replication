In the first court order, the petitioner, Pannaben Girishbhai Patel, had filed a petition challenging the rejection of her application for the production of additional documents in a criminal case. The documents in question were two agreements entered into between the parties, and the petitioner sought permission to produce a private handwriting expert opinion on record. However, the court rejected the petitioner's application, stating that it was an attempt to introduce a new defense at the fag end of the trial.

The court noted that the accused had already admitted her signature in the disputed cheque, and therefore, the expert opinion was not necessary. The court dismissed the petitioner's appeal and upheld the lower court's decision. This court order highlights the importance of timely submission of evidence and the consequences of introducing new defenses at the end of a trial.

In the second court order, the accused had made an application for the production of a document from the complainant during cross-examination. The complainant produced the documents in response, but the accused did not ask about the signature or particulars of the document in question. The court found that the application was filed to delay the trial and dismissed it, confirming the orders of the lower courts.

This court order emphasizes the need for parties to be specific and clear in their requests for evidence during cross-examination. It also highlights the consequences of filing frivolous applications that are intended to delay the trial process.

Overall, these court orders serve as reminders of the importance of following proper legal procedures and submitting evidence in a timely and relevant manner. They also demonstrate the consequences of attempting to introduce new defenses or filing frivolous applications that are intended to delay the trial process.
