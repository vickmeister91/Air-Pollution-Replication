The Delhi High Court recently heard a case brought by authorized dealers of petroleum companies seeking to quash the decision of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to implement a new traffic circulation plan for Connaught Place. The petitioners claimed that the plan violated their right to carry on trade and commercial activity. The plan involved permanently closing three radial roads and allowing only entry or exit on others. The petitioners alleged that the NDMC did not follow procedural safeguards and did not consult them before implementing the plan. The NDMC claimed the plan was implemented in public interest and after careful consideration and consultations with various agencies.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately concluded that while procedural safeguards must be followed for permanent closures or restrictions, temporary closures or restrictions for experimental purposes may not require prior approval from the council. The court also stated that it cannot examine the merits of the traffic plan and that a drop in profits due to the temporary measures does not constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, regarding the closure or restriction of public streets. The court directs the respondent to finalize the traffic circulation plan and follow the prescribed procedure if any public street or part of it is proposed to be closed permanently. The writ petition is dismissed subject to these directions.

The case highlights the tension between public interest and the right to carry on business. While the petitioners argued that the traffic plan would harm their business, the court ultimately found that the plan was implemented in public interest and that a temporary drop in profits did not constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of following procedural safeguards when implementing permanent closures or restrictions on public streets. The court's directive to the respondent to follow the prescribed procedure if any public street or part of it is proposed to be closed permanently serves as a reminder that such decisions must be made in accordance with the law and after due consideration of all relevant factors.

Overall, the court's decision in this case strikes a balance between public interest and the right to carry on business, while also emphasizing the importance of following procedural safeguards when making decisions that affect public streets.
