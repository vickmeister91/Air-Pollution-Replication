The National Green Tribunal recently heard appeals from Mrs. M. Saraswathi, proprietor of M/s. Ohm Sakthi Blue Metals, whose application for consent to operate a stone crushing unit was rejected by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued a closure order and disconnection of power supply to the unit for operating without obtaining consent under the Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981, and without providing adequate Air Pollution Control measures. The appellant challenged the dismissal of her appeals by the Appellate Authority, arguing that the existence of another stone crushing unit within 1 km of her unit should not be a criterion to reject her application for consent. However, the Tribunal dismissed the appeals.

The court order dated 27.07.2011 pertains to the rejection of an application for consent under Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981 for a stone crushing unit. The unit was found to be located within 1 km of another crushing unit for which consent had already been issued. The appellant challenged the rejection of the application before the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control, but the appeal was dismissed. The court considered the arguments of both sides and noted that the appellant had operated the unit without obtaining consent as required by law. The court also looked into the mandatory provisions for obtaining consent under Section 25 of the Water Act, 1974.

The court order restricts the establishment of any industry or process that may discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer, or land without the previous consent of the State Board. The consent of the Pollution Control Board of the State is a condition precedent for the establishment of an industry or for taking any steps for establishment. The order also states that the closure of units that operate illegally is justified, and making an application for consent under the Acts does not confer any right to establish or operate under the enactments. The order also upholds the validity of B.P. Ms. No.4 dated 02.07.2004, which stipulates a minimum distance between two stone crushing units as 1 km to avoid pollution influence of one over the other.

The court order states that certain measures that were previously not provided have now been provided. However, the appellant is not entitled to consent due to the application of B.P. Ms. No.4. The court sees no reason to interfere with the previous order and dismisses the appeals without cost.

In summary, the court orders discussed above pertain to the rejection of an application for consent to operate a stone crushing unit due to non-compliance with the Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981, and the failure to provide adequate air pollution control measures. The appellant challenged the rejection of the application, arguing that the existence of another stone crushing unit within 1 km of her unit should not be a criterion to reject her application for consent. However, the court upheld the validity of B.P. Ms. No.4, which stipulates a minimum distance between two stone crushing units as 1 km to avoid pollution influence of one over the other. The court also emphasized the importance of obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board of the State before establishing any industry or process that may discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer, or land. The closure of units that operate illegally is justified, and making an application for consent under the Acts does not confer any right to establish or operate under the enactments. Ultimately, the court dismissed the appeals without cost.
