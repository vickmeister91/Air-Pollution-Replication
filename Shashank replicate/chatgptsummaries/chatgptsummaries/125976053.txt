The Karnataka High Court has recently issued three court orders pertaining to various petitions filed under the Constitution of India. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri Balakrishna Gopal Adi against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner sought to quash a notification issued by the Assistant Commissioner of Kumta Sub Division, which directed the petitioner and others not to interfere with the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the land in question. The court has issued notices to various respondents, including the State of Karnataka, the Coastal Zone Management Authority, and the Grama Panchayat of Gokarna.

The second court order pertains to a petition filed under the Constitution of India, seeking to declare a notification as invalid. The notification relates to the prohibition of construction in certain areas of buildings where operations are carried out. The court has taken on record a copy of the government order issued in respect of the identification of areas under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991. The court has fixed the matter for further hearing.

The third court order directs the Coastal Zone Management Authority to take action against violations of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991. The violators must be given an opportunity to be heard and may be required to submit a written response. The Coastal Zone Management Authority is authorized to issue orders and proceed with the construction made by the petitioners until the final decision is made. The case is disposed of, and the related petitions do not survive.
