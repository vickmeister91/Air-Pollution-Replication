Three court orders have been summarized in this text. The first court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff had filed a suit seeking permanent injunction against the demolition of a constructed area in his flat. The defendants had filed applications for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. The court found that the plaintiff had already filed an appeal against the demolition order and hence the present suit was not maintainable. The court also found that the relief sought by the plaintiff could not be granted due to the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. The court disposed of the applications filed by the defendants and rejected the plaint.

In the second court order, the court rejected an application by the plaintiff to amend their complaint in a case against the Delhi Development Authority and a cooperative society. The plaintiff had sought a permanent injunction to prevent the demolition of a covered area of their flat, and also requested a copy of the sanction plan and completion plan. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had no right to prepare the building plan and that the amendments sought were in contravention of relevant laws. The court found that the plaintiff had not raised the issue of lacunas in their original complaint and rejected the application to amend it. The court also noted that the plaintiff had violated the terms of the agreement and bye-laws.

In the third court order, the court dismissed the plaintiff's application and suit, which sought to amend the prayer clause to convert their flat to freehold without seeking NOC from the defendant society. The court stated that any dispute regarding structural amendments must be filed through the society and not individually. The relief sought by the plaintiff is against the bye-laws and the authority of the society. The court referred to Section 70 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, which states that any dispute touching the management or business of the society shall be referred to the Registrar for decision, and no court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of such a dispute. The court also referred to guidelines given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Revajeetu Builders and Developers V/s Narayanaswamy and Sons and Others (2009) 10 SCC 84, while considering the application for amendment. The court dismissed the application of the plaintiff and allowed the application of the defendants.

In summary, all three court orders relate to disputes between individuals and cooperative societies or government authorities. The courts have consistently upheld the importance of following relevant laws and regulations, and have dismissed applications and suits that contravene these laws. The courts have also emphasized the importance of resolving disputes through the appropriate channels, such as the Registrar, rather than through individual lawsuits. Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of following due process and respecting the authority of relevant bodies in resolving disputes.
