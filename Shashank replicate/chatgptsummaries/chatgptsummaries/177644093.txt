The High Court of Madhya Pradesh has recently admitted the revision for hearing in the case of Bisan vs The State of Madhya Pradesh. Bisan has been convicted for offences under sections 51 proviso (1) r/w 2(16), 9, 39 & 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 years with a fine of Rs.10,000/-. The case has been listed for final hearing in due course.

Bisan's first application for suspension of sentence was allowed, provided he deposits the fine amount and furnishes a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety. This means that Bisan can be released from prison on bail, but he must pay the fine and provide a surety who can guarantee that he will appear in court for his trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where hunting and other activities are strictly prohibited.

Bisan's conviction under the Act suggests that he was involved in some form of illegal activity related to wildlife. The Act provides for strict penalties for such offences, including imprisonment and fines.

The admission of the revision for hearing in Bisan's case means that the High Court will review the lower court's decision and determine whether it was correct. This is a common procedure in the Indian legal system, where higher courts have the power to review and overturn lower court decisions.

The final hearing in Bisan's case will likely involve a detailed examination of the evidence presented by both sides, as well as arguments from their respective lawyers. The judge will then make a decision based on the facts of the case and the relevant laws.

Overall, Bisan's case highlights the importance of wildlife protection in India and the strict penalties that can be imposed for violations of the Wild Life Protection Act. The admission of the revision for hearing in his case also demonstrates the Indian legal system's commitment to ensuring that justice is served and that the rights of all parties are protected.
