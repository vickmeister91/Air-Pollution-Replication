The State of Rajasthan filed a bunch of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and others regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The State argued that the issue was covered by a previous judgment and should be decided accordingly. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries.

However, the court found little force in the respondents' argument and cited Section 26A(3) of the Act, which provides that no alteration of the boundaries of a sanctuary shall be made by the State Government except on a recommendation of the National Board. The court set aside the impugned orders and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court noted that Section 24(2)(a) of the Act empowers the Collector to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary, but only with the prior approval of the State Government. The court also noted that Section 26A(3) of the Act provides that no alteration of the boundaries of a sanctuary shall be made by the State Government except on a recommendation of the National Board.

The court found that the respondents' argument that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Act was not tenable. The court noted that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary was vested in the State Government, and not in the Collector. The court also noted that the power to alter the boundaries was subject to the recommendation of the National Board.

The court also considered the State's argument that the issue was covered by a previous judgment. The court noted that the previous judgment had held that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary was vested in the State Government, and not in the Collector. The court also noted that the previous judgment had held that the power to alter the boundaries was subject to the recommendation of the National Board.

In light of these considerations, the court set aside the impugned orders and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. The court directed the Collector to take into account the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the previous judgment while reconsidering the objections.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the previous judgment. The court found that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary was vested in the State Government, and not in the Collector. The court also found that the power to alter the boundaries was subject to the recommendation of the National Board. The court's decision underscores the importance of following the provisions of the Act and the recommendations of the National Board while altering the boundaries of a sanctuary.
