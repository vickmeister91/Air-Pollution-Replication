In the first court order, R N Siddappa had filed a criminal appeal against his conviction for offences under the Indian Electricity Act and the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The prosecution had alleged that Siddappa had drawn electricity to a fence surrounding his property, which resulted in the electrocution of an elephant. However, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that Siddappa was the owner of the land where the elephant was found, or that he had drawn electricity to the fence. As a result, the court set aside Siddappa's conviction and acquitted him of all charges.

The case revolved around the electrocution of an elephant, and the prosecution had alleged that Siddappa had drawn electricity to a fence surrounding his property, which resulted in the elephant's death. However, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that Siddappa was the owner of the land where the elephant was found, or that he had drawn electricity to the fence. The court noted that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that Siddappa had any connection to the fence or the electricity supply.

The court also observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that Siddappa had any motive to electrocute the elephant. The court noted that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that Siddappa had any animosity towards the elephant or any other wild animal. The court also observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that Siddappa had any financial gain from the electrocution of the elephant.

In light of these observations, the court set aside Siddappa's conviction and acquitted him of all charges. The court noted that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that Siddappa was entitled to the benefit of doubt.

In the second court order, the District and Sessions Judge in Chamarajnagar overturned the court order from October 2010 in Special Case No. 36/2005. The appellant had been found not guilty of all charges, and their bail bond had been cancelled. Any fines paid by the appellant would be refunded.

The details of the case are not provided in the summary, but it can be inferred that the appellant had been charged with some offence and had been acquitted by the District and Sessions Judge. The court order indicates that the appellant had been found not guilty of all charges, which suggests that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Overall, both court orders highlight the importance of the prosecution's burden of proof in criminal cases. In the first court order, the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and as a result, the accused was acquitted. In the second court order, the appellant had been found not guilty of all charges, which suggests that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. These court orders underscore the need for the prosecution to present strong and convincing evidence to prove its case, and the importance of the accused's right to the benefit of doubt.
