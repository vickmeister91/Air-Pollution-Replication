In a recent court case, a criminal revision was filed against an order passed by the 4th Additional Sessions Judge in Ratlam in Sessions Trial No.50/2015. The order in question had rejected an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 for supplying a copy of the daily diary. However, the court found no case to interfere with the order and dismissed the revision.

The case in question involved a request for a copy of the daily diary, which is a record of all the activities that take place in a police station on a daily basis. The request was made under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows for the production of documents or other items that are necessary for the investigation or trial of a case.

The court's decision to dismiss the revision was based on several factors. First, the court found that the order passed by the 4th Additional Sessions Judge was not illegal or improper in any way. Second, the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the daily diary was necessary for the investigation or trial of the case. Finally, the court found that the revision was filed solely for the purpose of delaying the trial and causing unnecessary inconvenience to the parties involved.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the revision was a clear indication that it takes the administration of justice very seriously. By upholding the order passed by the 4th Additional Sessions Judge, the court was able to ensure that the trial proceeded smoothly and without unnecessary delays or interruptions.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the criminal revision filed against the order passed by the 4th Additional Sessions Judge in Ratlam in Sessions Trial No.50/2015 was a clear indication of its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served in a timely and efficient manner. While the case may have been relatively minor in nature, its outcome will have far-reaching implications for the administration of justice in India.
