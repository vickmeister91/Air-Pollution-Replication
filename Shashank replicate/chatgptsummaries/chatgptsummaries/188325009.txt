The court has granted anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar, a Junior Engineer under the Rural Works Department, Koderma, in connection with a forest conservation case. The petitioner's duty was to look after the construction of the road, and he was least concerned with the boulders brought by the contractor from the forest area. The court ordered his release on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Koderma, within three weeks from the date of the order.

The case in question pertains to the conservation of forests in the Koderma district. The petitioner, Ashok Kumar, was a Junior Engineer under the Rural Works Department and was responsible for overseeing the construction of a road in the area. The contractor hired for the project had allegedly brought boulders from the forest area, which is a violation of forest conservation laws.

The court, while granting anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar, took into consideration the fact that he was not directly involved in the transportation of the boulders and was only responsible for the construction of the road. The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had appeared before the authorities whenever required.

The court ordered Ashok Kumar's release on bail on the condition that he furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Koderma, within three weeks from the date of the order. This condition ensures that the petitioner will appear before the court whenever required and will not abscond.

The granting of anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar is a significant development in the case. It provides him with temporary relief from arrest and allows him to prepare his defense. However, it is important to note that anticipatory bail is not a guarantee of immunity from arrest. If the investigation reveals evidence of the petitioner's involvement in the transportation of the boulders, he may still be arrested and prosecuted.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar in the forest conservation case is a significant development. It provides temporary relief to the petitioner and allows him to prepare his defense. However, it is important to note that the granting of anticipatory bail is not a guarantee of immunity from arrest, and the petitioner may still be arrested and prosecuted if evidence of his involvement in the transportation of the boulders is found.
