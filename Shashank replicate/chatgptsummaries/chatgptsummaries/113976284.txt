The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Suresh Pandre under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for an offence punishable under sections 9, 39, 44, 49(B)(I), 51, 52 of Vanya Prani Sanrakshan Adhiniyam, 1972 and sections 120-B, 34 of IPC. The allegation against the applicant is that he was carrying a skin of tiger in a motorcycle which is prohibited under the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court allowed the bail application on the grounds that the applicant is innocent, has been in custody since 12/05/2019, and there is no likelihood of him absconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence. The applicant was ordered to furnish a personal bond for the sum of Rs. 60,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The order also lists several conditions that the applicant must comply with, failing which the bail will be cancelled. These conditions include that the applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer; that he shall not leave India without the prior permission of the court; that he shall not tamper with the evidence or attempt to influence any witness; that he shall attend the court on all the dates of hearing and that he shall not commit any offence similar to the offence of which he is accused.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found that the applicant is innocent and there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products. Secondly, the court noted that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that his continued detention would be unjustified. Thirdly, the court found that there is no likelihood of the applicant absconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence.

The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the applicant is also significant. These conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant does not interfere with the investigation or trial of the case and that he appears before the court on all the dates of hearing. The court's decision to impose these conditions reflects its concern that the applicant may attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with the evidence.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is a significant development in this case. It reflects the court's commitment to ensuring that justice is done and that the rights of the accused are protected. The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the applicant is also significant, as it reflects the court's concern that the applicant may attempt to interfere with the investigation or trial of the case.
