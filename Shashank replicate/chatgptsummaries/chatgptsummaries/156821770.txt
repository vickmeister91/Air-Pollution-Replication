The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ appeal against a closure order issued to a rubber processing unit in Alappuzha District. The appellants had argued that there was no factual basis for the closure, but the court found that the matter was already gaining attention from the National Green Tribunal and that the appellants had other statutory remedies available to them. The court dismissed the appeal without prejudice to the appellants' contentions in other jurisdictions.

The case involved a rubber processing unit in Alappuzha District that had been issued a closure order by the local pollution control board. The appellants, who were the owners of the unit, had challenged the closure order in a writ petition before the Kerala High Court. They had argued that there was no factual basis for the closure and that the pollution control board had acted arbitrarily and without following due process.

The court, however, found that the matter was already gaining attention from the National Green Tribunal, which had issued notices to the appellants and the pollution control board. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal was a specialized forum that was better equipped to deal with environmental issues and that it would be appropriate for the appellants to pursue their contentions before that forum.

The court also found that the appellants had other statutory remedies available to them, such as filing an appeal before the appellate authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court noted that the appellants had not exhausted these remedies and that it would be premature for the court to intervene at this stage.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the writ appeal without prejudice to the appellants' contentions in other jurisdictions. The court clarified that the dismissal of the appeal would not prevent the appellants from pursuing their contentions before other forums, including the National Green Tribunal and the appellate authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court's decision highlights the importance of pursuing statutory remedies before approaching the courts. It also underscores the role of specialized forums, such as the National Green Tribunal, in dealing with environmental issues. The court's decision is likely to have implications for other cases involving environmental issues and may encourage litigants to pursue their contentions before specialized forums rather than approaching the courts directly.
