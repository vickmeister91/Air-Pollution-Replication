In the first court order, the petitioners sought a writ of Certiorari to quash the permission granted to respondent No.6 for laying a private underground pipeline and other permissions granted by respondent No.5 for laying down underground pipelines. The petitioners alleged that such permissions have been granted indiscriminately and in violation of environmental laws. The court adjourned the matter to enable the Central Ground Water Authority to take a final decision on issuing a notification under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court received a communication from the Administrator, Central Ground Water Authority, stating that regulation of groundwater development needs to be viewed in a broader perspective and should not completely stop/hinder development process indiscriminately. Instead, rainwater harvesting, artificial recharge, and water conservation are to be taken up in the area. This communication highlights the need for a balanced approach to groundwater development that takes into account both development needs and environmental concerns.

The second court order discusses the water levels in a particular district over several years and concludes that the situation is not alarming. The court notes that there is no notification prohibiting the use of groundwater and therefore, the installation of a tubewell pipe by an individual is not illegal. However, the court advises the state government to prepare a policy and guidelines for granting permission to lay underground pipelines through public property, taking into consideration the potential damage to the environment and ensuring compliance with conditions.

The state government is given six months to take necessary action. This order highlights the need for a policy framework that balances the need for development with environmental concerns. It also emphasizes the importance of compliance with conditions and guidelines to ensure that development activities do not cause harm to the environment.

Overall, these court orders highlight the need for a balanced approach to groundwater development that takes into account both development needs and environmental concerns. They also emphasize the importance of compliance with conditions and guidelines to ensure that development activities do not cause harm to the environment. The orders provide guidance to the Central Ground Water Authority and the state government on how to approach groundwater development in a responsible and sustainable manner.
