The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to election petitions filed in relation to various municipal ward elections in Delhi. The first court order pertains to an election petition filed by Sudhir Kumar against Ram Kishan Bansiwal and others in relation to the Municipal Ward no. 5, Bhalswa JahangirPur (SC) Delhi elections held on April 5, 2007. The petitioner alleged that the election process was unfair and violated the provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The petitioner claimed that several polling stations were added arbitrarily and against the order dated 7.2.2007, which defined the extent of each of the 272 wards, including Ward no. 5. The petitioner also alleged that genuine voters were not allowed to cast their votes, and the counting of votes was carried out in a chaotic manner. The court heard the arguments and delivered the judgment on September 23, 2009.

The second court order pertains to an election petition filed by a petitioner who alleges that despite leading by 85 votes, the respondent no. 1 was declared as the returned candidate in the Municipal Council election. The petitioner claims that the respondent no. 1 and his supporters threatened him to sign the result under the threat of his life. The respondent no. 1 denies all allegations and claims that the petitioner has filed the petition with a motive to harass him. The court has framed issues related to the delimitation of the constituency and the validity of the election.

The third court order lists several questions related to the violation of election procedures and rules in Ward No. 5 (Jahangir Puri) during the election of respondent no.1. The court has examined the Returning Officer and 13 witnesses to gather evidence. The witnesses have testified about being directed to cast their votes in a different polling station than the one they were assigned to. The election petitioner has also examined himself and placed reliance on various documents. The court has yet to decide whether the election of respondent no.1 should be declared null and void and whether the petitioner should be declared the returned candidate.

The fourth court order discusses the testimony of witnesses in a case regarding the conduct of an election. The issues being discussed include whether certain polling stations were added in violation of government notification and whether voters were directed to cast their votes in the wrong polling station. The court examines maps and other evidence to determine the validity of these claims.

The fifth court order discusses several issues related to the delimitation and polling stations for the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections. The court finds that the preparation of electoral rolls is required by law and the jurisdiction of civil courts to adjudicate on registration is barred. The court also finds that the polling stations were set up in accordance with the rules and public notice issued by the State Election Commission. The court rejects allegations that voters were prevented from casting their votes due to identity proof issues and that the declaration of population areas and polling stations was illegal. The court relies on documentary evidence and testimony from various witnesses to make its findings.

The sixth court order discusses a case regarding the electoral rolls and polling stations in Ward no. 5 and 19 in Delhi. The court examines various testimonies and documents related to the preparation of electoral rolls and polling stations. It is found that 34 voters were wrongly shown in Ward no. 5 instead of Ward no. 19, but none of them had cast their vote in Ward no. 5. The court dismisses the election petition and holds that the election of the respondent no. 1 is not liable to be declared null and void.
