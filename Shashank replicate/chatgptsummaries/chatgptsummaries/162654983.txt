The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by M/S Kizhakethalackel Rocks against the Kerala State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority's decision to reject their application for environmental clearance for a quarrying project in Kumily Village, Idukki District, Kerala. The SEIAA rejected the proposal due to the project site falling within ESZ-1 of Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP). The appellant argued that the SEIAA acted arbitrarily and illegally in rejecting the application. The Respondents argued that the decision was in compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Tribunal as well as instructions of MoEF. The appellant argued that the report and orders have only called for proper environmental control for the existing quarrying projects in the region.

The court order discusses the rejection of a proposal for grant of environmental clearance (EC) for quarrying activities in ESZ-1 area. The appellant argued that the rejection was not based on proper application of mind and that the recommendations in the WGEEP report did not call for a blanket ban on quarrying activities. The court examined the factual scenario and the regulatory authority's exercise of jurisdiction under the Environment Clearance Regulations of 2006. The court found that the rejection was prompted by the court's directions and the recommendations of the WGEEP report, and that the regulatory authority had the power to reject the proposal.

The court order pertains to the granting of environmental clearance (EC) for a quarrying project in the Western Ghats region of India. The court directs that the WGEEP report, which sheds light on environmental concerns in the region, be taken into consideration when granting EC for projects in the ESZ-1 zone. However, there is no blanket ban on granting EC for projects in this zone. The SEAC and SEIAA are directed to reconsider the application for EC in accordance with the law and prescribed conditions. The order sets aside the previous decision to refuse EC for the quarrying project and refers the case back to SEIAA/SEAC for fresh consideration.

In summary, the court order pertains to a quarrying project in Kumily Village, Idukki District, Kerala, which was rejected by the Kerala State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) due to the project site falling within ESZ-1 of Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP). The appellant, M/S Kizhakethalackel Rocks, appealed the decision, arguing that the rejection was arbitrary and illegal. The court examined the regulatory authority's exercise of jurisdiction under the Environment Clearance Regulations of 2006 and found that the rejection was prompted by the court's directions and the recommendations of the WGEEP report. The court directed that the WGEEP report be taken into consideration when granting environmental clearance (EC) for projects in the ESZ-1 zone, but there is no blanket ban on granting EC for projects in this zone. The SEAC and SEIAA were directed to reconsider the application for EC in accordance with the law and prescribed conditions, and the order set aside the previous decision to refuse EC for the quarrying project and referred the case back to SEIAA/SEAC for fresh consideration.
