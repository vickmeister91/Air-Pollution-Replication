In a recent court order, petitioner Anoop Gupta withdrew their petition and was granted permission to file all relevant documents related to their application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court at an appropriate stage. The trial court was directed to consider these documents in accordance with the law.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the production of documents or other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The section empowers the court to issue a summons or order to produce such documents or things.

In this case, it appears that Anoop Gupta had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court. However, for some reason, they withdrew their petition. The court order does not provide any details about the reasons for the withdrawal.

Nevertheless, the court granted permission to Anoop Gupta to file all relevant documents related to their application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the trial court at an appropriate stage. This means that Anoop Gupta can still produce the documents they were seeking through their application, but at a later stage.

The court also directed the trial court to consider these documents in accordance with the law. This is a standard direction that courts give when they order the production of documents or other evidence. It means that the trial court must examine the documents and determine whether they are admissible as evidence under the relevant provisions of the law.

Overall, this court order is fairly straightforward. It simply allows Anoop Gupta to file their documents at a later stage and directs the trial court to consider them in accordance with the law. It is unclear what the documents are or what they relate to, but it is likely that they are relevant to the ongoing proceedings in the trial court.
