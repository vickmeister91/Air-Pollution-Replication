In a recent court order, the second bail application filed by Raja Singh Bhadoriya was rejected under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Bhadoriya had been arrested by the Forest Department in connection with a 2003 case involving illegal transportation of sand. The court found no new grounds to consider the repeat bail application and ordered a copy of the order to be given to the respondent's lawyer.

The case against Bhadoriya dates back to 2003 when he was allegedly involved in the illegal transportation of sand. The Forest Department had filed a case against him and he was subsequently arrested. However, he was released on bail soon after. The case had been pending in court for several years and had not seen any significant progress.

In 2020, the Forest Department arrested Bhadoriya again in connection with the same case. He had filed a bail application which was rejected by the court. He then filed a second bail application which has now been rejected as well.

The court found no new grounds to consider the repeat bail application. The grounds for bail are well established in law and the court found that there was no change in circumstances that would warrant a grant of bail. The court also noted that the case had been pending for a long time and that the trial was likely to be completed soon. Therefore, the court did not see any reason to grant bail at this stage.

The court ordered a copy of the order to be given to the respondent's lawyer. This is a standard practice in court proceedings. The respondent's lawyer is entitled to a copy of any order passed by the court. This allows them to review the order and take any necessary steps in response to it.

In conclusion, the court has rejected the second bail application filed by Raja Singh Bhadoriya in connection with a 2003 case involving illegal transportation of sand. The court found no new grounds to consider the repeat bail application and ordered a copy of the order to be given to the respondent's lawyer. The case has been pending for several years and the trial is likely to be completed soon. Therefore, the court did not see any reason to grant bail at this stage.
