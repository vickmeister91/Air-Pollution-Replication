The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves mining activity in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan, and the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The government issued a notification in 2015 requiring the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) in two equal installments within two years, which the petitioner and other mining lease holders deposited under protest. The court heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.

The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industry. The names of the petitions and the corresponding petitioners and respondents are listed. The legal representation for both the petitioners and respondents is also mentioned. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

One of the disputes discussed in the court order is over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster.

Another dispute discussed in the court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to issue directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court order also pertains to a group of 136 mining lease holders in a forest area of 281 hectares in India. The mining lease holders were asked to pay a Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of their lease period, but they refused to pay for the entire 281 hectares and also did not segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department. The total common area being used by the mining lease holders will be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The disputes involve the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, the validity of diversion subject to certain conditions, and the computation of the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for each lease holder individually. The court directed the Mining Department to relinquish the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases to the Forest Department and to divide the total common area being used by the mining lease holders equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.
