The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Sukhpati Prasad Dwivedi under Section 482Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Special and Additional Sessions Judge, Sidhi in Criminal Revision No.44/2013 affirming the order passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sidhi rejecting the application filed by the applicant under Section 457 Cr.P.C. for grant of interim custody of a Hiwa truck seized by Police Churhat in connection with an offence registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Indian Forest Act, 1927.

The petitioner had sought interim custody of the vehicle in question, which had been seized by the police in connection with an offence registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Indian Forest Act, 1927. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sidhi had rejected the application, and the Special and Additional Sessions Judge, Sidhi had affirmed this decision in Criminal Revision No.44/2013.

The petitioner had argued that the lower courts had erred in rejecting his application for interim custody of the vehicle, and had sought relief from the High Court under Section 482Cr.P.C. The High Court, however, found that the jurisdiction of the court had been barred for entertaining the application for grant of interim custody of the vehicle/property under Section 52C of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and dismissed the petition.

Section 52C of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, deals with the disposal of property seized in connection with offences under the Act. It provides that any property seized in connection with an offence under the Act shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and that no court shall order the release of such property without the permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden or the authorized officer.

In light of this provision, the High Court found that the lower courts had correctly rejected the petitioner's application for interim custody of the vehicle, as they did not have the jurisdiction to grant such relief under Section 52C of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The High Court therefore dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482Cr.P.C.

Overall, the court order in question deals with the jurisdiction of the court to grant interim custody of property seized in connection with offences under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The High Court found that the lower courts had correctly rejected the petitioner's application for interim custody of the vehicle in question, as they did not have the jurisdiction to grant such relief under Section 52C of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The court order therefore serves as an important reminder of the limitations on the jurisdiction of courts in such matters, and the need to carefully consider the relevant provisions of the law before seeking relief from the courts.
