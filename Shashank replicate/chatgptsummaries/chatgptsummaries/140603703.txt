The National Insurance Company Ltd. appealed against an award made by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in a case involving a motor vehicular accident. The claimants had sought compensation of INR 15,00,000, and the Tribunal awarded INR 12,00,000 with interest. The appellant argued that they should not be held liable for the compensation, as the offending vehicle was not in the possession of the registered owner at the time of the accident, the deceased was a gratuitous passenger, and the appellant was added as a party-respondent in the claim petition in 2002, but interest was awarded from 1996. The court rejected these arguments and held that transfer of a vehicle cannot absolve the insurer from third party liability.

The court order discusses the liability of an insurer towards a third party in case of a transfer of ownership of an insured vehicle. The court states that the liability towards a third party remains the same whether under the old Act or the new Act. The court also emphasizes that the right of a third party cannot be defeated even if the owner has committed a breach. The court cites Section 146 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which mandates the protection of the rights of third parties and imposes a compulsory duty on owners to get their vehicles insured. The court also cites a previous case where the intention of the legislature to make third party insurance compulsory was highlighted.

The court order states that it is mandatory for all motor vehicles to have third party insurance to protect individuals using the road from any harm caused by the vehicle. The court upholds an award given to claimants due to injuries caused by a motor vehicle and dismisses the appeal made by the owner of the vehicle. The court also directs the registry to release the awarded amount to the claimants and send the record to the Tribunal's file.

The court order states that the transfer of a vehicle does not absolve the insurer from third party liability and the insurer must satisfy the award. The court cites previous judgments to support this principle and emphasizes that the liability of the insurer does not cease even if the owner or purchaser fails to give intimation of transfer to the insurance company.
