The Gujarat High Court recently received a writ application from Kethos Tiles Pvt. Ltd. against the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB).

The genesis of this litigation lies in the order passed by a Division Bench of this Court dated 10th October 2019 in the Writ Petition (PIL) No.72 of 2016. The court disposed of the petition with a liberty to all the concerned to approach the Court by filing fresh proceedings in case of difficulty.

Ltd. for violating siting criteria and operating an industrial plant located near a residential area and water body. The GPCB had ordered the company to show cause within 15 days as to why the consent should not be revoked. As the consent order was revoked, a closure order was passed, and the power supply to the unit was disconnected. The writ applicants approached the court, arguing that the orders were passed without giving them an opportunity of hearing. 

The court order states that if the closure order was passed without giving the petitioner a chance to be heard, the matter may be remanded back for a fresh hearing. The court found that appropriate opportunity of hearing was not given to the writ applicants and therefore both the impugned orders were quashed and set aside. The matter is remitted to the GPCB for fresh hearing and the writ applicants shall appear before the competent authority and make good their case. The exercise must be completed within six weeks from the date of the order. The respondents No.3 is directed to restore the power supply so far as the industrial unit of the writ applicants is concerned.
