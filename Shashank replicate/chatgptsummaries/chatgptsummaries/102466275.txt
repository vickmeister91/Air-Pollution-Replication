The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard a petition from M/S Ispace Developers Pvt. Ltd. and others to quash a complaint and summoning order under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint alleged that the accused had started a construction project without obtaining prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court heard arguments from both sides, including evidence that the company had applied for Environment Clearance Certificate and had been granted approval for construction by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Ultimately, the court did not quash the complaint and summoning order, allowing the trial to proceed.

The case in question involved allegations that M/S Ispace Developers Pvt. Ltd. had started a construction project without obtaining prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The company had applied for an Environment Clearance Certificate and had been granted approval for construction by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Despite this, a complaint was filed against the company under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

The court heard arguments from both sides, with the company arguing that they had obtained the necessary clearance and approval for the construction project. The prosecution argued that the company had not obtained the necessary clearance before starting the project. The court considered the evidence presented by both sides and ultimately decided not to quash the complaint and summoning order, allowing the trial to proceed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the allegations made against the company were serious and required a trial to determine the truth. The court noted that the company had obtained approval from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, but this did not necessarily mean that they had obtained the necessary clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also noted that the company had not produced any evidence to show that they had obtained the necessary clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

In a separate case, the court discussed a complaint filed against a company for starting a construction project without obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate. However, it was revealed that the company had obtained the certificate before starting the project. The court found the allegations vague and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings, stating that continuing the criminal proceedings would be an abuse of process of law.

The court's decision in this case was based on the fact that the allegations made against the company were vague and lacked substance. The court noted that the company had obtained the necessary clearance before starting the project, and therefore, the complaint was without merit. The court also noted that continuing the criminal proceedings would be an abuse of process of law.

In conclusion, the Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard two cases involving allegations of starting construction projects without obtaining the necessary Environment Clearance Certificate. In one case, the court allowed the trial to proceed, while in the other case, the court quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings. The court's decisions were based on the evidence presented in each case and the seriousness of the allegations made against the companies involved.
