In another order, the court notes that the occupants of certain premises had been ordered to vacate the premises by 30th June 2018 and had clarified that if they vacated before 31st December 2017, they would not have to pay rent or occupation charges.

Some occupants offered to redevelop the land at their own cost, subject to supervision by the railway authorities. The court directed the railway authorities to develop the land either on their own or with the occupants, and to take a decision within two months. The court also modified its order regarding payment of use and occupation charges. The court appreciated the efforts of the learned Amicus Curiae.
