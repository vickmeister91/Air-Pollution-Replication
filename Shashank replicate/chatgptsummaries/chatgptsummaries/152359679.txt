In a recent court case, a petition was filed against the trial court's decision to modify the charge and frame it for an offense punishable under Section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The modification was made after an application was filed to summon the x-ray report, which revealed a fracture in the left hand of the injured. The court rejected the petition and found no illegality in the trial court's decision to consider the extra evidence brought on record by the prosecution/state.

The case in question involved an incident where the accused had allegedly caused hurt to the victim by hitting him with a stick. The accused was initially charged under Section 323 of the IPC, which deals with punishment for voluntarily causing hurt. However, during the trial, the prosecution filed an application to summon the x-ray report of the victim's left hand, which revealed a fracture. Based on this new evidence, the trial court modified the charge and framed it under Section 325 of the IPC, which deals with punishment for causing grievous hurt.

The accused filed a petition challenging the trial court's decision to modify the charge. The petitioner argued that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction by considering the extra evidence brought on record by the prosecution/state. The petitioner also contended that the trial court had not given the accused an opportunity to cross-examine the witness who had produced the x-ray report.

The court, however, rejected the petitioner's arguments and upheld the trial court's decision to modify the charge. The court observed that the trial court had the power to modify the charge at any stage of the trial if it found that the charge did not reflect the true nature of the offense. The court also noted that the prosecution had produced the x-ray report during the trial and had given a copy of it to the accused. Therefore, the accused had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness who had produced the report.

The court further observed that the trial court had considered the x-ray report along with other evidence on record before modifying the charge. The court found no illegality in the trial court's decision to consider the extra evidence brought on record by the prosecution/state. The court held that the trial court had acted within its jurisdiction and had not violated any principles of natural justice.

In conclusion, the court rejected the petition filed against the trial court's decision to modify the charge and frame it for an offense punishable under Section 325 of the IPC. The court found no illegality in the trial court's decision to consider the extra evidence brought on record by the prosecution/state. The court held that the trial court had acted within its jurisdiction and had not violated any principles of natural justice. This case highlights the importance of producing all relevant evidence during the trial and the power of the trial court to modify the charge if it finds that the charge does not reflect the true nature of the offense.
