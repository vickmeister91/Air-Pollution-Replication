The case at hand involves a petition filed by Mallappa Guruling Naik under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Naik sought to set aside an order passed by the Civil Judge & JMFC Court in Hukkeri, which had rejected an application filed by the prosecution under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. The prosecution had sought to summon certain documents for confrontation purposes, but the court had already cross-examined the accused and found no good reasons to allow the application.

Section 311 of Cr.P.C. allows a court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, even if they have not been summoned as a witness or if they have already been examined. The section also allows the court to recall and re-examine any witness who has already been examined. The purpose of this section is to ensure that all relevant evidence is brought before the court and that justice is done.

In this case, the prosecution had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to summon certain documents for confrontation purposes. However, the accused had already been cross-examined, and the court found no good reasons to allow the application. The court rejected the application filed under Section 311 of Cr.P.C., and Naik filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside this order.

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The section allows the High Court to pass any order necessary to prevent injustice or to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, Naik argued that the order passed by the trial court was erroneous and that the court had failed to exercise its jurisdiction properly. However, the High Court found no merit in Naik's arguments and rejected the petition. The court held that the trial court had considered all the relevant facts and had come to a reasoned decision. The court also noted that the power under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. is discretionary and that the trial court had exercised its discretion properly.

The court further held that the power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. should be used sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of the court or where the ends of justice require intervention. The court noted that in this case, there was no such abuse of process or requirement for intervention.

In conclusion, the High Court rejected the petition filed by Naik under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the trial court had exercised its discretion properly and that there was no abuse of the process of the court or requirement for intervention. The case highlights the importance of Section 311 of Cr.P.C. in ensuring that all relevant evidence is brought before the court and that justice is done. It also emphasizes the need for the High Court to use its inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of process or requirement for intervention.
