The case at hand involves a petition by Jackson and Company, a manufacturer of diesel generators, to quash Rule 2(c) of the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules, 2002. The rule sets a noise limit of 75 dB(A) for all diesel generators up to 1000 KVA, manufactured on or after July 1, 2003. The petitioners argue that the rule violates Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India, as it fixes a standard noise limit for all diesel generators regardless of location and capacity. They also argue that the rule places an undue burden on manufacturers to provide integral acoustic enclosures.

The court examines the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the various rules and notifications issued under it, and ultimately upholds the validity of the rule. The court notes that noise pollution affects not only human beings but also animals and nature, and that it is necessary to impose restrictions to ensure that people can live their lives with peace and without breaching Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The court order discusses the responsibility of manufacturers and sellers in ensuring that their diesel generating sets meet noise emission standards. The court states that it is the manufacturer's responsibility to provide an acoustic enclosure to achieve the prescribed standard of emission, and not the user's responsibility. The court also emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing pollution, and states that the right to a healthy life is to be preferred and enforced over individual liberties. The court concludes that calling upon manufacturers to provide a device to control noise pollution is necessary to protect the health of the public and is in line with the Constitution's directive principles.

The court order states that manufacturers of diesel generating sets are permitted to operate under a license or permit, but must provide a device to prevent noise pollution in order to protect public health and safeguard citizens' rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court finds that there is a reasonable connection between the restrictions imposed and the objective of protecting citizens' rights, and therefore the amended rules are not violative of any fundamental rights. The court also notes that the Act authorizes the state to make rules to prevent noise pollution, and dismisses the petitions.

In summary, the court upholds the validity of Rule 2(c) of the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules, 2002, which sets a noise limit of 75 dB(A) for all diesel generators up to 1000 KVA, manufactured on or after July 1, 2003. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing pollution, and states that the right to a healthy life is to be preferred and enforced over individual liberties. The court places the responsibility of meeting noise emission standards on the manufacturers and sellers of diesel generating sets, and finds that the amended rules are not violative of any fundamental rights. The court's decision is in line with the Constitution's directive principles and the Act's authorization for the state to make rules to prevent noise pollution.
