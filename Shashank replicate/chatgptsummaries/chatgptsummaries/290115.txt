The court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner had filed 29 private complaints against the respondents for dishonour of cheques issued in discharge of loan liability. The respondents had filed a list of defence witnesses, which included the petitioner's wife. The petitioner had sought to set aside this list of defence witnesses, specifically objecting to the inclusion of his wife.

The court, after hearing both sides, ruled that the accused had no right to summon the complainant's wife as a defence witness. The court further stated that the summoning of the petitioner's wife would not be in the interest of the case. The court, therefore, set aside the order granting permission to summon the petitioner's wife.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the inclusion of the petitioner's wife as a defence witness was not necessary for the accused to present their case. The court also observed that the petitioner's wife was not a material witness in the case and that her testimony would not add any value to the proceedings.

Furthermore, the court noted that the inclusion of the petitioner's wife as a defence witness could potentially cause harm to the petitioner's family life. The court observed that the petitioner's wife was not a party to the case and that her inclusion as a defence witness could lead to unnecessary harassment and inconvenience to her.

The court's decision was also based on the principle of fairness and justice. The court observed that the accused had no right to summon the complainant's wife as a defence witness, as this would be an abuse of the legal process. The court further noted that the summoning of the petitioner's wife would not be in the interest of justice, as it would not contribute to the resolution of the case.

In light of these factors, the court set aside the order granting permission to summon the petitioner's wife. However, the court only partly allowed the criminal original petitions, indicating that there were other issues that needed to be addressed in the case.

Overall, the court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court's ruling was guided by the principles of fairness, justice, and the protection of the petitioner's family life. The court's decision serves as a reminder that the legal process should not be abused and that the interests of justice must always be upheld.
