In 2012, the Supreme Court of India decided a case filed by the Research Foundation for Science against the Union of India and others. The case pertained to the handling of hazardous wastes and ship-breaking. The court passed various interim orders and disposed of the case by reasserting the interim directions given. However, the petitioner filed an application in 2012 stating that several issues have not been dealt with in the judgment of the court, and directions on those issues should be made. The court has decided that the matter should be dealt with by the National Green Tribunal, which is better equipped to deal with the issues arising. The court has closed the case and all connected matters.

On July 18, 2018, the Supreme Court of India heard a writ petition (civil) regarding the Research Foundation for Science and the State of M.P. Various lawyers and advocates represented the parties involved in the case. The court heard from various lawyers representing different states and parties and ordered the State of Madhya Pradesh to continue executing projects related to drainage and sewage and ensure their completion as soon as possible. The court also directed the state government to address deficiencies in the supply of potable water to 42 identified localities and submit a report on the action taken.

The court requested the Head of RPBD, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, to be present in court and submit views on the way forward to address the quality of groundwater. The court also permitted the Bhopal Group for Information and Action to interact with the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, and requested the Director of IIT, Chennai, to depute a suitable person to explain the details of the matter. The court directed the state of Madhya Pradesh to meet the expenses of travel for the two persons by crediting the requisite amount in their respective bank accounts. The matter has been listed for August 30, 2018.

The court's decision in the 2012 case highlights the importance of proper handling of hazardous wastes and ship-breaking. The National Green Tribunal is better equipped to deal with such issues, and it is essential to ensure that hazardous wastes are disposed of safely to prevent harm to the environment and human health.

In the 2018 case, the court ordered the State of Madhya Pradesh to continue executing projects related to drainage and sewage and ensure their completion as soon as possible. The court also directed the state government to address deficiencies in the supply of potable water to 42 identified localities and submit a report on the action taken. These orders are crucial to ensure that the basic needs of the people are met, and they have access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities.

The court's request for the Head of RPBD, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, to be present in court and submit views on the way forward to address the quality of groundwater is also significant. Groundwater is a vital resource, and it is essential to ensure that it is not contaminated by hazardous wastes or other pollutants. The court's decision to permit the Bhopal Group for Information and Action to interact with the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, and request the Director of IIT, Chennai, to depute a suitable person to explain the details of the matter is also crucial. It will help to ensure that the issue is thoroughly examined, and appropriate action is taken to address any concerns.

In conclusion, the court's orders in both cases highlight the importance of proper handling of hazardous wastes and the need to ensure that people have access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities. The court's decision to refer the 2012 case to the National Green Tribunal and its orders in the 2018 case are significant steps towards protecting the environment and human health. It is essential to ensure that these orders are implemented effectively to achieve the desired outcomes.
