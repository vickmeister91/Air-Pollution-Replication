The court order in question is related to a civil miscellaneous second appeal filed by A.G. Prabhakaran and E. Sasidharan against the District Forest Officer and the Forest Settlement Officer in Gudalur, Nilgiris. The appellants had filed a writ petition in 1981 to prevent eviction from their land without following the procedures under the Forest Act, 1882. The Forest Settlement Officer had excluded the land from the forest block, but the District Court reversed the decision and declared the land as reserve forest. The appellants claimed long possession of the land, but the court found no evidence to support their claim and dismissed the appeal.

The case revolves around a dispute over land ownership and the procedures to be followed under the Forest Act, 1882. The appellants had filed a writ petition in 1981 to prevent eviction from their land, which was excluded from the forest block by the Forest Settlement Officer. However, the District Court reversed the decision and declared the land as reserve forest, which meant that the appellants could be evicted without following the procedures under the Forest Act.

The appellants claimed long possession of the land, but the court found no evidence to support their claim. The court observed that the appellants had failed to produce any documents to prove their ownership or possession of the land. The court also noted that the appellants had not paid any revenue or taxes on the land, which further weakened their claim.

The court further observed that the Forest Settlement Officer had excluded the land from the forest block without following the procedures under the Forest Act. The court noted that the Forest Settlement Officer had not conducted a survey of the land or given any notice to the appellants before excluding the land from the forest block. The court also observed that the Forest Settlement Officer had not obtained the necessary approvals from the higher authorities before excluding the land from the forest block.

The court held that the District Court had rightly declared the land as reserve forest, as the Forest Settlement Officer had excluded the land from the forest block without following the procedures under the Forest Act. The court also held that the appellants had failed to prove their ownership or possession of the land, and therefore, their claim could not be accepted.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership and the procedures to be followed under the Forest Act, 1882. The court held that the District Court had rightly declared the land as reserve forest, as the Forest Settlement Officer had excluded the land from the forest block without following the procedures under the Forest Act. The court also held that the appellants had failed to prove their ownership or possession of the land, and therefore, their claim could not be accepted.
