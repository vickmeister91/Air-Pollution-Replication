The National Green Tribunal recently heard a case filed by M.C. Mehta against various educational institutions and government bodies for not complying with the Supreme Court's direction to provide compulsory environmental education to students. The applicant argued that the subject was being taught by unqualified teachers and that many states had not taken any concrete steps to implement the directive. The tribunal heard arguments from both sides and reserved its order.

Another court order discussed an application made to the Green Tribunal regarding the lack of education in environmental science and the need for it to be taught in universities and colleges. The applicant requested the tribunal to issue directions to ensure that the subject is taught by qualified teachers and professors. The respondent states argued that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matter. The court ruled that the tribunal can only entertain applications that satisfy the prerequisites stated in Section 14 of the NGT Act, which includes civil cases raising substantial questions relating to the environment and where such questions arise out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act. The court also emphasized the importance of keeping within the jurisdictional provisions of the Act.

The court order also discussed the definition of "substantial question relating to environment" and "person aggrieved" in the context of the NGT Act. The court explains that the definition of "substantial" should be given a wide meaning and must be debatable, not previously settled, and have a material bearing on the case and its issues relating to the environment. The court also states that an "aggrieved person" is someone who has suffered a legal grievance and has a legal cause of action. The court further explains that the expression "disputes" arising from the questions referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the NGT Act is of wide magnitude and includes disputes referred to in Section 14(2).

The court order also discussed the interpretation of the word "dispute" in Section 14 of the NGT Act and its connection to the environment. The court emphasizes that the disputes must be substantial and relate to the environment, and that the word "implementation" should be interpreted narrowly in this context. The court also discusses the meaning of "implementation" and its use in other laws. The court concludes that the dispute must have a direct nexus to the environment and cannot be a generic term used to expand the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The court also notes that the applicant's request for directions regarding the teaching of environmental science in colleges and institutions does not fall within the framework of the NGT Act and the Scheduled Acts.

The court order further states that the terms and conditions of appointment of teachers and how environmental science should be taught in an educational institution must be distinguished from the activity for prevention and control of pollution. The applicant's claim under Section 14 of the NGT Act is not maintainable, and the tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant the reliefs prayed for by the applicant. The applicant is at liberty to approach the court of competent jurisdiction. The court has not examined the merits of the case or any other contention raised by the parties except to the extent afore-stated. The application is dismissed as not maintainable, and the parties will bear their own costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed the lack of education in environmental science and the need for it to be taught in universities and colleges. However, the court ruled that the tribunal can only entertain applications that satisfy the prerequisites stated in Section 14 of the NGT Act, which includes civil cases raising substantial questions relating to the environment and where such questions arise out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act. The court emphasized the importance of keeping within the jurisdictional provisions of the Act and the need for disputes to have a direct nexus to the environment. The court also noted that the terms and conditions of appointment of teachers and how environmental science should be taught in an educational institution must be distinguished from the activity for prevention and control of pollution. Ultimately, the court dismissed the application as not maintainable, and the parties will bear their own costs.
