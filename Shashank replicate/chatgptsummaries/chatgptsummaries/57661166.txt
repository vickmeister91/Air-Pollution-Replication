The court has granted bail to Shivprasad Yadav, who had been in custody since February 6, 2018, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that some unknown persons had cut and carried the sexual parts and nails of a male bear found in a forest area, and some hairs of the bear were seized from Yadav's possession. Yadav's counsel argued that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated due to enmity with a co-accused. The court allowed Yadav's bail application, directing him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount.

The case against Yadav was registered under Section 9 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which prohibits hunting, killing, or capturing any wild animal or attempting to do so. The act also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal or its parts. The prosecution alleged that Yadav was in possession of some hairs of the bear, which is a protected species under the act. The prosecution also alleged that Yadav was involved in the cutting and carrying of the sexual parts and nails of the bear, which is a serious offense under the act.

Yadav's counsel argued that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case due to enmity with a co-accused. The counsel submitted that Yadav was a resident of the village where the incident had taken place and was known to the forest officials. The counsel further submitted that Yadav had no motive or reason to commit the offense and that the prosecution had failed to establish any link between Yadav and the offense.

The court considered the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense and observed that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against Yadav. The court noted that the prosecution had relied on the recovery of some hairs of the bear from Yadav's possession, but there was no evidence to show that Yadav had any knowledge about the presence of the hairs in his possession. The court also observed that the prosecution had not been able to establish any link between Yadav and the cutting and carrying of the sexual parts and nails of the bear.

The court further observed that Yadav had been in custody for more than two years and that the trial was not likely to be completed in the near future. The court noted that Yadav had no criminal antecedents and that he had cooperated with the investigation. The court also observed that Yadav had a family to support and that his release on bail would not prejudice the trial.

In view of the above, the court allowed Yadav's bail application, directing him to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. The court also directed Yadav to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the court as and when required. The court cautioned Yadav that his bail would be cancelled if he violated any of the conditions imposed by the court.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Shivprasad Yadav, who had been in custody since February 6, 2018, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court observed that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against Yadav and that he had cooperated with the investigation. The court directed Yadav to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount and to cooperate with the investigation. The court cautioned Yadav that his bail would be cancelled if he violated any of the conditions imposed by the court.
