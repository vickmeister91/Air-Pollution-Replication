The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Swami Prasad Kuderiya challenging an order passed by respondent no. 3, which granted permission for the grant of a mining lease subject to the condition that the petitioners shall be required to obtain prior approval of the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioners were already holding the lease for a long time, and their counsel contended that the condition of obtaining approval from the Government of India under the Act, 1980, was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The court found that the area in question falls within the forest area, and therefore, the order impugned was not illegal. The writ petition was dismissed.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a law enacted by the Indian Parliament to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, and to ensure that such diversion is done only in exceptional cases and with the prior approval of the Central Government.

The Act provides for the constitution of a National Committee for Conservation of Forests and Wildlife, which is responsible for advising the Central Government on matters relating to the conservation of forests and wildlife. The Act also provides for the constitution of State-level Committees for Conservation of Forests and Wildlife, which are responsible for advising the State Governments on matters relating to the conservation of forests and wildlife.

The Act further provides for the constitution of a Central Empowered Committee, which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Act and for advising the Central Government on matters relating to the conservation of forests and wildlife.

In the present case, the court found that the area in question falls within the forest area, and therefore, the condition of obtaining approval from the Government of India under the Act, 1980, was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court held that the condition was necessary to ensure that the mining lease does not adversely affect the forest area and the wildlife therein.

The court also observed that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a beneficial legislation enacted for the protection and conservation of forests and wildlife, and that the provisions of the Act must be given effect to in order to achieve the object of the Act.

The court further held that the petitioners cannot claim any vested right in the mining lease, and that the grant of the lease is subject to the condition of obtaining prior approval of the Central Government under the Act, 1980.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Swami Prasad Kuderiya challenging an order passed by respondent no. 3, which granted permission for the grant of a mining lease subject to the condition that the petitioners shall be required to obtain prior approval of the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court found that the area in question falls within the forest area, and therefore, the condition of obtaining approval from the Government of India under the Act, 1980, was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court held that the condition was necessary to ensure that the mining lease does not adversely affect the forest area and the wildlife therein. The writ petition was dismissed.
