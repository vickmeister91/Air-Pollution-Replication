The case in question involves allegations of illegal hunting and cooking of wild boar on the petitioner's field. The accused, Pappu Choudhary, and others were found in possession of the cooked meat, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The petitioners, who are the owners of the field, have sought anticipatory bail in connection with their apprehension of arrest in the case.

The court has directed the petitioners to surrender before the court within two weeks and be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate. One of the bailors should be a local resident having property within the jurisdiction of the court concerned. This means that the petitioners will have to provide a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each, along with two sureties of the same amount, to secure their release on anticipatory bail.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners is based on the fact that they are the owners of the field where the alleged illegal hunting and cooking took place, and there is no evidence to suggest that they were involved in the illegal activity. The court has also taken into account the fact that the petitioners have no criminal record and are not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The requirement for one of the bailors to be a local resident with property within the jurisdiction of the court concerned is a standard condition for granting bail in India. This condition is meant to ensure that the bailors have a stake in the local community and are more likely to ensure that the accused appear in court when required.
