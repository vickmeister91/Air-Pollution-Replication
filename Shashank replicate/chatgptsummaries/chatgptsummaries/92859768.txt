The Bhadra Wildlife Trust filed a writ petition against the State Government of Karnataka to stop road widening works at Mullayyangiri hill. The hill is the highest mountain peak in Karnataka and falls within the Eco-Sensitive Zone of Bhadra Tiger reserve. The petitioners argued that the work was being carried out without conducting an Environment Impact Assessment and without taking any measures. The court ordered that no work shall be carried out on the roads within the proposed 'Conservation Reserve' without following the procedure in accordance with the law. The court also directed the State Government to publish a declaration under Section 36-A of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, within four months and to constitute a Conservation Reserve Management Committee within three months from the date of the declaration.

The declaration of an area as a Conservation Reserve ensures that the area is protected from any activity that may harm the environment and wildlife.

The court's order is a reminder to the State Government of Karnataka and other state governments in India to follow the due process of law and protect the environment and wildlife. The court's order also highlights the need for conservation organizations to continue their efforts towards the protection of wildlife and their habitats.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case filed by the Bhadra Wildlife Trust against the State Government of Karnataka is a significant victory for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats.
