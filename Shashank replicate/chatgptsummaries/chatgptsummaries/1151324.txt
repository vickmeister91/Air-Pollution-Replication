The Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (VMC) filed a writ petition against the order issued by the Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests, challenging the rejection of their request for the establishment of a sewerage treatment plant in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The court order discusses the background of the case, including the establishment of the sewerage treatment plant and the CRZ regulations. The court ultimately finds that the establishment of the plant is permissible under the CRZ regulations, and criticizes the government's interpretation of the rules.

The case revolves around the establishment of a sewerage treatment plant by the VMC in the CRZ. The VMC had applied for clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, which was rejected on the grounds that the establishment of the plant was not permissible under the CRZ regulations. The VMC then filed a writ petition challenging the rejection of their request.

The court order discusses the CRZ regulations and the background of the case. The CRZ regulations were introduced in 1991 to regulate development activities in the coastal areas of India. The regulations prohibit certain activities in the CRZ, including the setting up of industries and the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea. The regulations also require clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests for certain activities in the CRZ.

The court finds that the establishment of the sewerage treatment plant is permissible under the CRZ regulations. The court notes that the VMC had obtained clearance from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board and the Andhra Pradesh Coastal Zone Management Authority for the establishment of the plant. The court also notes that the VMC had conducted an environmental impact assessment and had obtained a no-objection certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The court criticizes the government's interpretation of the CRZ regulations. The court notes that the government had interpreted the regulations to prohibit the establishment of the sewerage treatment plant in the CRZ. The court finds that this interpretation is incorrect and that the establishment of the plant is permissible under the regulations.

The court also notes that the respondents' interpretation of a notification clause was leading to untreated sewage being discharged into the sea, increasing pollution. The court quashes the order and directs the respondents to issue necessary clearance to the petitioner for installing a sewerage treatment plant. No costs were awarded.

In conclusion, the court order allows the VMC to establish the sewerage treatment plant in the CRZ. The court finds that the establishment of the plant is permissible under the CRZ regulations and criticizes the government's interpretation of the rules. The court also notes that the respondents' interpretation of a notification clause was leading to untreated sewage being discharged into the sea, increasing pollution. The court quashes the order and directs the respondents to issue necessary clearance to the petitioner for installing a sewerage treatment plant. No costs were awarded.
