Two court orders have been issued in relation to an eviction petition filed by G.D. Wadhwa against Sanjay Kumar Rastogi for a shop in Wadhva Complex, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi. The first court order pertains to an application filed by Rastogi under Section 25-B of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, seeking leave to contest the eviction petition. The court heard arguments from both parties and denied Rastogi's application for leave to defend. The court found that Rastogi's grounds for defense lacked material evidence and were not recognized under the DRC Act.

The second court order is regarding the eviction petition filed by Wadhwa against Rastogi for possession of a shop in a building complex. Wadhwa claimed that the shop was urgently required for his granddaughter-in-law's accommodation. Rastogi argued that Wadhwa was not the owner or landlord, but simply a person collecting rent. The court found that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties and that Rastogi had failed to disclose any facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order. The court allowed the eviction order with costs, but it would not be operative for six months.

In the first court order, Rastogi had sought leave to defend the eviction petition filed by Wadhwa. However, the court found that Rastogi's grounds for defense lacked material evidence and were not recognized under the DRC Act. Section 25-B of the DRC Act provides for the right of a tenant to contest an eviction petition filed by the landlord. However, the tenant must first seek leave of the court to contest the petition by filing an application supported by an affidavit. The court may grant leave to defend if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for contesting the eviction petition.

In this case, Rastogi had filed an application under Section 25-B of the DRC Act seeking leave to defend the eviction petition filed by Wadhwa. Rastogi had raised several grounds for defense, including that the eviction petition was not maintainable, that the landlord had not complied with the provisions of the DRC Act, and that the landlord had not given proper notice to the tenant. However, the court found that Rastogi's grounds for defense lacked material evidence and were not recognized under the DRC Act.

The court observed that Rastogi had not produced any evidence to support his claim that the eviction petition was not maintainable. The court also noted that the landlord had complied with the provisions of the DRC Act and had given proper notice to the tenant. The court further observed that Rastogi had not raised any valid defense under the DRC Act. The court, therefore, denied Rastogi's application for leave to defend and allowed the eviction petition filed by Wadhwa.

In the second court order, Wadhwa had filed an eviction petition against Rastogi for possession of a shop in a building complex. Wadhwa claimed that the shop was urgently required for his granddaughter-in-law's accommodation. Rastogi, on the other hand, argued that Wadhwa was not the owner or landlord, but simply a person collecting rent.

The court found that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties and that Rastogi had failed to disclose any facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order. The court observed that Wadhwa was the owner of the property and had the right to seek possession of the shop. The court further noted that Rastogi had not raised any valid defense against the eviction petition.

The court, therefore, allowed the eviction petition with costs, but it would not be operative for six months. This means that Rastogi would have six months to vacate the shop before the eviction order becomes operative. The court also directed Rastogi to pay the costs of the eviction proceedings.

In conclusion, the court has issued two orders in relation to an eviction petition filed by G.D. Wadhwa against Sanjay Kumar Rastogi for a shop in Wadhva Complex, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi. In the first order, the court denied Rastogi's application for leave to defend the eviction petition filed by Wadhwa. In the second order, the court allowed the eviction petition with costs, but it would not be operative for six months. The court found that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties and that Rastogi had failed to disclose any facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order.
