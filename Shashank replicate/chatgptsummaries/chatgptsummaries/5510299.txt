The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances granted for mining activities. The court heard all the writ petitions together and decided on a common judgment.

The controversy involves the demand notice for Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The petitioner, along with other mining lease holders, deposited a sum of money as compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining activity. The Forest Department demanded NPV from the Mining Department, which was to be deposited within two years of the notification dated 01.04.2015.

The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases have since been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases, and to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for those leases.

The total common area being used by the mining lease holders shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare, and after such division, the share of each mining lease holder as per one hectare shall be paid by him, inclusive of his individual lease NPV.

The court order also pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner claims that they have already deposited the required amount, but the Forest Department is demanding a second installment for leases that were surrendered or cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be charged for these leases and that the demand is contrary to the law. The court is presented with various documents and arguments from both sides regarding the status of the mining leases and the calculation of the compensation.

The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.
