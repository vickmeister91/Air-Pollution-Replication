The case in question involves a criminal petition filed by Suryakant Shivaraya Veerakar, who sought to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.132/2009 (P.C.No.44/2008) on the file of the JMFC Court, Saundatti, as well as the order dated 21.01.2013 passed by it. The petitioner was accused of not taking effective steps to treat sewage effluent in a proper manner, which led to the contamination of Malaprabha river water.

The petitioner argued that the proceedings against him were initiated without any basis and that the allegations against him were false. He further contended that the order passed by the trial court was erroneous and that it had failed to appreciate the evidence on record.

However, the court dismissed the petition and gave the petitioner the liberty to urge all remedies before the trial court. The court held that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and that they required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to establish that the proceedings against him were initiated without any basis.

The court further observed that the trial court had considered all the evidence on record and had arrived at a reasoned conclusion. The court held that it was not within its jurisdiction to interfere with the order passed by the trial court unless there was a clear error of law or fact.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to establish that he had suffered any prejudice as a result of the order passed by the trial court. The court held that the petitioner had the right to challenge the order passed by the trial court before the appropriate forum and that he should avail himself of this remedy.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner and gave him the liberty to urge all remedies before the trial court. The court held that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and that they required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the trial court had considered all the evidence on record and had arrived at a reasoned conclusion.
