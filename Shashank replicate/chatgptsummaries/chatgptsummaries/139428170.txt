In a recent court order, the Madras High Court has allowed a Criminal Original Petition filed by M. Murugesan and four others against the State, represented by the Inspector of Police, Palacode Police Station, Dharmapuri District. The petitioners had sought to set aside the summons issued to them under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with C.S.R.No.455 of 2014.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and set aside the summons. The court also gave liberty to the police to issue fresh summons to the petitioners, mentioning the details of documents to be produced by them for enquiry.

The case pertains to an incident that occurred in 2014, where the petitioners were allegedly involved in a land dispute with the complainant.
