The Environment (Protection) Act was enacted in 1986 with the objective of providing for the protection and improvement of the environment. The act empowers the central government to take measures to protect and improve the quality of the environment and to prevent and control environmental pollution. The act also provides for the establishment of authorities to regulate and enforce environmental standards.

In this case, Manoj Baheti and Sibabrata Mohanty were apprehending their arrest in connection with a complaint case registered under the Environment (Protection) Act. The details of the complaint case are not available, but it is likely that the petitioners were accused of violating environmental standards or causing environmental pollution.

The court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners, which means that they will not be arrested if they comply with the conditions set by the court. The conditions include surrendering in court within four weeks and furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The sureties are individuals who guarantee that the petitioners will comply with the conditions of the bail and will appear in court when required.

In addition to the bond and sureties, the petitioners are also required to deposit Rs. 25,000 each in the trial court on the date of surrender. This amount will be subject to the result of the case, which means that if the petitioners are found guilty, the amount will be forfeited to the government. If the petitioners are acquitted, the amount will be returned to them.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a discretionary power of the court, which means that the court can decide whether or not to grant bail based on the facts and circumstances of the case. In this case, the court has considered the apprehension of arrest by the petitioners and has granted bail with certain conditions.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a relief for the petitioners, as it allows them to avoid arrest and to prepare their defense without being in custody. However, the conditions set by the court must be complied with, and any violation of the conditions can result in the cancellation of the bail and the arrest of the petitioners.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Manoj Baheti and Sibabrata Mohanty in connection with a complaint case registered under the Environment (Protection) Act. The petitioners have been directed to surrender in court within four weeks and will be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. They are also required to deposit Rs. 25,000 each in the trial court on the date of surrender, which will be subject to the result of the case. The grant of anticipatory bail is a relief for the petitioners, but they must comply with the conditions set by the court to avoid the cancellation of the bail.
