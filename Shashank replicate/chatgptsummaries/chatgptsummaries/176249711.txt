The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by K.M. Hiriyannappa challenging the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Shimoga, rejecting his claim to dig a bore-well on his property. The court held that the appropriate authority had not sought advice from a technical officer and that the introduction of high power technology to extract groundwater strikes at the very root of groundwater as a property right available to every property owner. The court also noted that while landowners have a right over groundwater, it is not a captive resource and flows like a river beneath the surface, providing a source of growth and survival to the population.

The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting public access to water resources and the duty of the state to control the ownership and distribution of these resources for the common good. The order also highlights the constitutional duty of citizens to protect the environment and natural resources. The court upholds the decision of the appropriate authority to regulate the sinking of bore-wells and protect public water resources.
