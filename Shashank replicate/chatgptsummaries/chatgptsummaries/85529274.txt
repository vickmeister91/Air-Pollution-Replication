The State of Telangana has filed a writ petition challenging an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that restrained the state from carrying out any construction activities for the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme or any other activity like felling of trees, blasting and tunneling in the forest areas in violation of Forest Conservation Act. The NGT had passed an interim order until the mandatory statutory clearances including Environment and Forest clearances are granted. The state has challenged the order on the grounds that the NGT had pronounced the operative portion of the order first, and the reasoned order later, which is contrary to the National Green Tribunal (Practices and Procedure) Rules, 2011. The state has also argued that the NGT lacked territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the first respondent-applicant.

The court order discusses the power of judicial review and the jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It states that the power of judicial review cannot be negated or circumscribed even by a constitutional amendment or legislation. The court also discusses the existence of an alternative remedy of appeal under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and concludes that the mere existence of an alternative remedy does not operate as a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court emphasizes that the power of judicial review is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and cannot be negated or circumscribed.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the 2010 Act and the importance of adhering to the time limit specified in Section 14(3) of the Act. The court also notes that the NGT must examine when the cause of action for a dispute first arose before considering whether an application is within the time limit. The court also discusses the existence of an alternate remedy and the need for the High Court to consider it before exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court ultimately concludes that the petitioner's contentions regarding the jurisdiction of the NGT should have been examined and that the NGT should have determined whether the application was filed within the time limit specified in Section 14(3) of the Act.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in a case related to the Kaleswaram irrigation project in Telangana. The court notes that the NGT must exercise its powers strictly in accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Act under which it was created. The court also emphasizes the importance of the NGT assigning reasons for exercising its jurisdiction to entertain the case and grant interim relief. The court further discusses the concept of cause of action and notes that the NGT must determine when the cause of action for the dispute first arose and whether the case was filed within the prescribed period of limitation. The court concludes that these are matters for the NGT to examine and not for the court to decide.

The court order discusses two main issues. Firstly, it states that the petitioner does not have the right to immediate judgment of dismissal of the O.A. Secondly, it discusses whether the Principal Bench of the NGT at New Delhi lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application. The court concludes that the failure of the NGT to examine whether the O.A was filed within the period stipulated in Section 14(3) and its proviso is fatal and sets aside the interim order passed by it. The court also concludes that the first respondent-applicant could not have filed an application before the Principal Bench of the NGT at New Delhi as it lacked territorial jurisdiction to entertain the O.A.

The court order discusses a case where the National Green Tribunal (NGT) failed to consider the issue of territorial jurisdiction raised by the petitioner. The court finds that the failure to decide this question of territorial jurisdiction cannot result in denial of relief to the petitioner. The court also expresses concern over certain incidents related to the project, such as the alleged involvement of forest land and the felling of trees. The court sets specific directions for the petitioner and the State of Telangana regarding the project and remands the matter to the NGT to consider the request for interim relief afresh.

In summary, the court orders discussed the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the power of judicial review. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to the time limit specified in Section 14(3) of the Act and the need for the NGT to assign reasons for exercising its jurisdiction to entertain the case and grant interim relief. The court also noted that the mere existence of an alternative remedy does not operate as a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court set specific directions for the petitioner and the State of Telangana regarding the project and remanded the matter to the NGT to consider the request for interim relief afresh.
