In India, the protection and improvement of the environment and wildlife is mandated by the Constitution. The courts have played a significant role in enforcing these mandates and ensuring that the government takes necessary steps to prevent environmental degradation. Two court orders, in particular, stand out as examples of the judiciary's commitment to environmental protection.

The first court order, in M.C. Mehta vs Union of India & Ors on 11 October 1996, dealt with the question of whether mining operations should be stopped within a 5 km radius of tourist resorts in Haryana to preserve the environment and control pollution. The court gave five directions, including a ban on construction of any type within a 5 km radius of Badkhal lake and Surajkund, and the conversion of all open areas into green belts. The court clarified that areas already under construction would be excluded from the ban. The court also discussed the concept of sustainable development and the precautionary principle, stating that the environment and public health have priority over unemployment and loss of revenue.

The court's decision was based on the Precautionary Principle, which requires the government to anticipate, prevent, and attack causes of environmental degradation. The court recognized that the environment and public health have priority over unemployment and loss of revenue. The court's decision was also based on the concept of sustainable development, which seeks to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision was significant because it recognized the importance of protecting the environment and public health. The court's decision also recognized the importance of sustainable development, which seeks to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision was a clear message to the government and industry that environmental protection is a priority and that they must take necessary steps to prevent environmental degradation.

The second court order, which prioritizes the protection and improvement of the environment and wildlife in India, requires the government to take necessary steps to prevent environmental degradation. The court's decision was based on the Precautionary Principle, which requires the government to anticipate, prevent, and attack causes of environmental degradation. The court's decision was also based on the concept of sustainable development, which seeks to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision requires the government to protect two lakes from degradation by limiting construction activity in their vicinity. No construction is allowed within the green belt area and within one kilometer radius of the lakes, except for recreational and tourism purposes with prior approval. Existing constructions and personal residential houses are allowed within the area, subject to building bye-laws/rules and clearance from authorities. All development schemes and plans for constructions within 5 km radius of the lakes require prior approval from pollution control boards.

The court's decision was significant because it recognized the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife in India. The court's decision also recognized the importance of sustainable development, which seeks to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision was a clear message to the government and industry that environmental protection is a priority and that they must take necessary steps to prevent environmental degradation.

In conclusion, the court orders in M.C. Mehta vs Union of India & Ors and the protection and improvement of the environment and wildlife in India prioritize the protection and improvement of the environment and wildlife in India. The court's decisions were based on the Precautionary Principle and the concept of sustainable development, which seek to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decisions were significant because they recognized the importance of protecting the environment and public health and sent a clear message to the government and industry that environmental protection is a priority.
