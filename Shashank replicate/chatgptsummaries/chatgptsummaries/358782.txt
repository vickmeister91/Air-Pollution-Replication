The Bombay High Court recently heard a case brought by the Bombay Environment Action Group against the State of Maharashtra and various private parties regarding the protection of the environment in the Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani twin hill stations. The court had previously issued directions for the protection of the environment in the area, but the petitioners claimed that no appropriate actions had been taken. The court considered various prayers, including the demolition of illegal constructions, the implementation of recommendations from a monitoring committee, and the protection of natural and man-made heritage sites. The area had also been declared an eco-sensitive region by the Central Government, with regulations governing activities such as tourism, industrial units, and the use of plastics.

The court order prohibits construction on hill slopes and the discharge of untreated effluent in the eco-sensitive zone. Local authorities must create a plan for solid waste segregation and treatment. A High Level Monitoring Committee will be appointed to ensure compliance with the notification and has the power to regulate noise pollution, traffic, and file complaints under the Environment (Protection) Act. The order also addresses the protection of heritage structures, conservation of forests, and management of solid waste and sewage treatment. The Municipal Councils of Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani must establish appropriate treatment plants for sewage and solid waste, and hotels and educational institutions must comply with environmental norms. The Central Government has the power to disconnect water and electricity supply to erring institutions, and a new Monitoring Committee must be appointed to enforce the notification.

The court order requires hotels and industries to have their own treatment facilities for sewage and effluents, and gives a period of six months for the Municipal Council of Panchgani to ensure its treatment plant works efficiently. The court also addresses grievances against property owners for violating building bye-laws and illegal constructions, stating that only one main building and subsidiary structures for domestic use are permitted on a 0.4 hectare plot zone, and that unsafe buildings must be repaired or demolished as directed by the authorities. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and eco-sensitive zones.

The court order discusses the interpretation of building bye-laws and development control rules for the Mahabaleshwar Municipal Council. The main issue is whether certain constructions in the area violate these bye-laws, particularly with regards to FSI utilization and the number of structures allowed on a plot. The court considers arguments from both sides, including the contention that some constructions are simply restorations and not new constructions. The court also discusses the power of the Director of Town Planning to permit special relaxation of bye-laws and the pending approval of proposed new bye-laws. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the constructions in question violate the relevant bye-laws and what action should be taken in response.

The court order states that the power to grant concessions in cases of hardship can only be used in specific cases where a clearly demonstrable hardship is caused. The Municipal Commissioner must take into account all relevant facts when exercising this power. The court also directs the Municipal Councils to set up sewage treatment plants and solid waste management facilities within a specific time frame. The court appreciates the efforts of the Monitoring Committee and directs the Registrar General to pay them for their work. The Committee is requested to continue its work until the orders are fulfilled and to make reports from time to time. The court also directs the hoteliers and commercial institutions to have their own treatment facility by the end of December 2006.

The court order includes various directives related to construction and preservation of land in Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar. The Municipal Council is required to provide necessary information on construction applications and a committee will be reimbursed for visits and reports. Specific properties, including hotels and cottages, are expected to be demolished if they violate regulations. Several civil applications related to construction violations are also disposed of, with the authorities examining papers and taking action in accordance with the law. Private parties are permitted to apply for relaxation of structures prior to 1985 on a case-by-case basis, but this benefit does not apply to farmhouses in hill stations and villages.

In summary, the Bombay High Court has issued a comprehensive order aimed at protecting the environment in the Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani twin hill stations. The order covers a range of issues, including the prohibition of construction on hill slopes, the establishment of treatment plants for sewage and solid waste, and the protection of heritage structures and conservation of forests. The court has also appointed a High Level Monitoring Committee to ensure compliance with the notification and has given the Central Government the power to disconnect water and electricity supply to erring institutions. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and eco-sensitive zones and has directed the Municipal Councils to set up sewage treatment plants and solid waste management facilities within a specific time frame. The court has also addressed grievances against property owners for violating building bye-laws and illegal constructions and has directed specific properties, including hotels and cottages, to be demolished if they violate regulations. Overall, the court order is a significant step towards protecting the environment in the Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani twin hill stations.
