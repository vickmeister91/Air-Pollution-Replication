The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a charge sheet against C.L. Bhola, a public servant, and three others for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (P.C. Act) and Indian Penal Code (IPC). The charge sheet alleges that Bhola possessed assets disproportionate to his known source of income. Bhola has filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the production of documents collected in a previous case, which he claims are necessary for his defence. The court has heard arguments from both sides and is considering whether the documents are necessary or desirable for the present case. The court has referred to previous judgments on the scope of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the relevance of documents to the defence of the accused.

The court order states that the defence of the accused is not relevant at the initial stage of framing of charge, and the accused cannot invoke Section 91 Cr.P.C. to seek production of any document to prove his innocence. The court held that the necessity and desirability of producing documents should be examined with reference to the stage when a prayer is made for their production. The accused cannot produce documents in his possession to prove his defence, and the court cannot take into consideration external materials given by an accused for reaching the conclusion that no offence was disclosed or that there was a possibility of his acquittal. The application is dismissed with a cost of Rs. 5000 to be deposited in Legal Aid Cell.
