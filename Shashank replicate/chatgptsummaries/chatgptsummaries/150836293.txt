In a recent court order, Dayaram, who had been in jail since September 2014 for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, was granted bail. The applicant's counsel argued that since co-accused with similar allegations had been granted bail, Dayaram should also be released on bail. The court agreed and ordered Dayaram's release on a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas, as well as the regulation of hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the punishment of offences related to wildlife, including hunting, poaching, and trafficking.

Dayaram was arrested in September 2014 for allegedly hunting and killing a wild boar in a protected area. He was charged under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and had been in jail since his arrest. His counsel argued that since co-accused with similar allegations had been granted bail, Dayaram should also be released on bail.

The court agreed with the applicant's counsel and ordered Dayaram's release on a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety. The court's decision was based on the principle of parity, which means that co-accused with similar allegations should be treated equally under the law. The court also took into account the fact that Dayaram had been in jail for a long time and that his trial was likely to take a long time to conclude.

The court's decision to grant bail to Dayaram is significant as it highlights the importance of the principle of parity in the administration of justice. The principle of parity ensures that co-accused with similar allegations are treated equally under the law, and that no one is unfairly discriminated against. The court's decision also takes into account the fact that prolonged pre-trial detention can be detrimental to an accused person's mental and physical health, and can also lead to a miscarriage of justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Dayaram is a welcome development in the administration of justice. The decision highlights the importance of the principle of parity in ensuring that co-accused with similar allegations are treated equally under the law. The decision also takes into account the fact that prolonged pre-trial detention can be detrimental to an accused person's mental and physical health, and can also lead to a miscarriage of justice. Overall, the court's decision is a step towards ensuring that justice is served fairly and equitably in India.
