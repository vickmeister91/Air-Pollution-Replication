Two court orders have been summarized here, both of which pertain to cases under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The first case involves Miss P. Lilly, who was convicted for issuing a dishonored cheque and sentenced to two years of simple imprisonment. She was also ordered to pay Rs. 9,97,400/- as compensation to the complainant, M/s. Ashirvad Enterprises. Miss P. Lilly filed a revision petition claiming that she was not given sufficient opportunity to cross-examine the complainant, but the court rejected her claim, stating that she had failed to utilize the several opportunities given to her to cross-examine the complainant. The court upheld the conviction and sentence and ordered Miss P. Lilly to pay the balance amount of Rs. 25,000/- to the complainant.

The second case involves a petitioner who has paid a total sum of Rs. 4,23,700/- to the respondent, leaving a balance of Rs. 25,000/- to be paid. The petitioner has requested for the sentence to be set aside, citing previous judgments. The respondent opposes this, stating that the case has been pending for over a decade. The court refers to previous judgments and observes that an offense under Section 138 of the Act cannot be equated with other criminal offenses. The court orders the petitioner to pay a compensation of Rs. 1,50,000/- to the respondent within six weeks, in addition to the amount already paid, and sets aside the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the lower courts. The respondent is entitled to withdraw the deposited amount of Rs. 2,50,000/- with accrued interest.
