The court has granted bail to Bhagwan Singh, who was in judicial custody at District Jail Dholpur, in a case related to the transportation of Bajri. The bail is granted on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. He is also required to appear before the trial court and any other court to which the matter may be transferred.

Bhagwan Singh was arrested in connection with the transportation of Bajri, which is a type of sand used in construction. He was accused of violating the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2017. The police alleged that he was transporting Bajri without a valid permit and was therefore in violation of the law.

After being arrested, Bhagwan Singh was remanded to judicial custody at District Jail Dholpur. He remained in custody for several weeks before his bail application was heard by the court. During this time, his family and friends had been working to secure his release.

The court considered the arguments put forward by both the prosecution and the defense before granting bail to Bhagwan Singh. The prosecution had argued that he was a flight risk and that he may tamper with evidence if released on bail. The defense, on the other hand, had argued that he was not a flight risk and that he had cooperated fully with the investigation.

In granting bail, the court imposed certain conditions on Bhagwan Singh. He was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. He was also required to appear before the trial court and any other court to which the matter may be transferred. These conditions were imposed to ensure that he would not abscond and that he would cooperate fully with the investigation.

Bhagwan Singh's release on bail was welcomed by his family and friends. They had been working tirelessly to secure his release and were relieved that he would be able to return home. However, they were also aware that the case against him was still ongoing and that he would need to continue to cooperate with the investigation.

The case against Bhagwan Singh highlights the importance of complying with the law when it comes to the transportation of minerals. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2017, are in place to regulate the transportation of minerals and to prevent illegal mining. Those who violate these laws can face serious consequences, including imprisonment and fines.
