The court order in question pertains to the dismissal of a review petition that was filed against an earlier order transferring a writ petition to the National Green Tribunal in Chennai. The writ petition had been filed as a public interest litigation, and the transfer was made in accordance with the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 and a specific direction from the Supreme Court.

The review petition was filed in an attempt to challenge the earlier order, but the court found no reason to review it and dismissed the petition with no order as to costs. This means that the earlier order transferring the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal in Chennai stands, and the case will be heard by the tribunal.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 to handle cases related to environmental issues and disputes. It has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial environmental harm, and its decisions are binding and enforceable.

The transfer of the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal was made in accordance with the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, which empowers the Supreme Court to transfer cases to the tribunal if it deems it necessary for the effective and expeditious disposal of the case.

The writ petition that was transferred to the National Green Tribunal was filed as a public interest litigation, which means that it was filed on behalf of the public at large and not just for the benefit of the petitioner. Public interest litigation is a powerful tool for promoting the public interest and holding the government and other public authorities accountable.

The dismissal of the review petition means that the case will now be heard by the National Green Tribunal, which will have the power to make binding decisions on the matter. The tribunal will be able to consider all the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and make a decision based on the merits of the case.

Overall, the court order dismissing the review petition is a significant development in the case, as it means that the matter will now be heard by the National Green Tribunal. This is an important step in ensuring that environmental issues are given the attention they deserve and that the public interest is protected.
