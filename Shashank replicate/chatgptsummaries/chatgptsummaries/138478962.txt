The court order in question is related to a case between Mohit Lohiya and Ram Nivas Sharma. The counsel for the applicant, Mohit Lohiya, argued that the burden of proof placed on him by the Trial Court in a previous order was unwarranted. This was because Lohiya had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking direction to produce the income tax returns of the complainant, Ram Nivas Sharma.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, Lohiya had sought the production of Sharma's income tax returns to establish his financial status and credibility.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the counsel for the applicant, issued notice to the respondent, Ram Nivas Sharma, on payment of process fee. The case was listed for the week commencing 13.11.2017.

This court order is significant as it highlights the importance of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. in establishing the credibility of a complainant in a criminal case. By seeking the production of Sharma's income tax returns, Lohiya was attempting to establish whether Sharma had the financial means to carry out the alleged offence. This is an important aspect of any criminal case, as it can help to establish the motive and intent of the accused.

Furthermore, the court's decision to issue notice to the respondent on payment of process fee indicates that the court is taking the matter seriously and is willing to hear both sides of the argument. This is an important aspect of the judicial process, as it ensures that justice is served and that all parties are given a fair hearing.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between Mohit Lohiya and Ram Nivas Sharma highlights the importance of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. in establishing the credibility of a complainant in a criminal case. The court's decision to issue notice to the respondent on payment of process fee indicates that the court is taking the matter seriously and is willing to hear both sides of the argument.
