The Himachal Pradesh High Court issued a series of orders on March 11, 2020, pertaining to various cases related to the regulation of stone crushers and the jurisdiction of different courts and tribunals. The first order, related to two cases, CWP No. 2067 of 2019 and CWP No. 4342 of 2019, clarified the jurisdiction of the Division Bench of the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India over the order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The court cited a Supreme Court judgment in Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board vs. Sterlite Industries (I) Ltd. & others, 2019 (3) SCALE 721, which clarified the jurisdiction of high courts under Article 226 of the Constitution over the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal. The court also modified the interim order passed in this matter by the court on August 29, 2019.

The second order pertained to the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal in matters related to service and recruitment of members of All-India Services, civil services, defense services, and civilians appointed to government or government-controlled entities. The order clarified that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) does not have the power of judicial review akin to that of a High Court exercising constitutional powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The NGT can only exercise appellate jurisdiction against orders, decisions, directions, or determinations made under various Acts mentioned in Section 16 of the NGT Act.

The third order discussed two judgments by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the jurisdiction and powers of High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court clarified that the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts against military or armed forces disputes, but such powers must be exercised restrictively and on limited grounds. The court also emphasized that the jurisdiction under Article 226 cannot be circumscribed by any enactment and must be zealously protected. The court suggested that direct appeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals should be revisited and appeals to Division Benches of High Courts should be provided instead.

The fourth order directed the Union to undertake an exercise to increase affordability of justice and provide High Court judges with adequate experience before coming to the Supreme Court. The court also examined an impugned order regarding the legality of operations of stone crushers in Himachal Pradesh. The order directed a joint inspection to verify the validity of consents and mining leases and whether the location of the stone crushers is within permissible sites. The applicant sought directions to stop the stone crusher on Khasra No. 752/3 Mahal Lougni Tehsil Sarkaghat, District Mandi.

The fifth order pertained to the regulation of stone crushers in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The State Pollution Control Board had directed a stone crusher unit to stop its operation due to violation of distance norms from a water body. However, consent to operate was later granted. The court examined a notification specifying distance norms for stone crushers and found that it prohibits the location of a stone crusher within 100 meters of certain water bodies, including those of perennial nature. The court emphasized the importance of protecting water bodies and quashed the consent to operate granted to any stone crusher within 100 meters of a water body. The State filed a review petition, which was also dismissed.

The sixth order pertained to the regulation of the location of stone crushers near water bodies. The court rejected the argument that only perennial water bodies need to be protected and sought expert opinion on the matter. The expert committee recommended that the distance norm of 100 meters should be uniformly applied to all streams, and no mining/extraction activities should be carried out on first order non-perennial streams. The court refused to review or modify the earlier view that non-perennial water bodies are not covered by the prohibition of location of stone crushers within 100 meters.

The seventh order stated that non-perennial water bodies are not covered by the prohibition of location of stone crushers within 100 meters of such bodies. The expert opinion suggested that restriction of distance for location of stone crushers should universally apply for 'perennial' as well as 'non-perennial' water bodies. The court also noted that non-perennial rivers may have different characteristics and may function very differently in maintaining hydrological and ecological balance. The court dismissed the applications and rejected the contention that the prohibition does not apply to the units already set up. The court also provided the history of the controversy surrounding the stone crushing units and the guidelines issued by the government of Himachal Pradesh.

The eighth order pertained to the recommendations made by a Joint Expert Committee regarding the location and operation of stone crusher units near streams. The committee recommended that a distance norm of 100 meters be applied uniformly to all streams, and that no mining/extraction activities be carried out on first order non-perennial streams. However, small first order streams with steep gradients may be exempted from the distance norm subject to additional precautionary measures. The court order makes the interim order passed in CMP No. 8459 of 2019 absolute, subject to certain directions, including the use of world-class technology and state-of-the-art machinery, adherence to international protocols, and inspection of roads and parking facilities.

The final order stated that any construction in the area must not disrupt traffic flow or cause traffic jams, and there must be enough parking space for trucks. Two applications,
