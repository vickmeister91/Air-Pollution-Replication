The Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) filed a writ application challenging the validity and constitutionality of the Orissa Act 3 of 1994. The company sought to declare the act invalid, but the court found that the writ petition did not disclose any existing legal right in favor of the petitioner and dismissed the case. Later, SAIL filed an application for amendment, seeking to incorporate certain amendments to the writ application. However, the court found that the petitioner had entered into an agreement with the State Government to pay water charges for the water actually consumed in terms of the provisions of Orissa Irrigation Act, 1959 and rules made thereunder. The court also found that the petitioner was liable to pay such enhanced charges which have been duly approved by the Governor.

The court order pertains to two connected writ petitions filed by SAIL (RMD) regarding the use of water from a natural stream for mining purposes. The court found that the writ petition did not disclose any cause of action for approaching the writ court and that no relief had been sought against the agreement entered between the petitioner and the State Government. The court also noted that the matter is a recurring feature and required the formation of a High Power Committee to resolve the controversy regarding the enhancement of water rate expeditiously. The writ petitions were disposed of with the above observations.
