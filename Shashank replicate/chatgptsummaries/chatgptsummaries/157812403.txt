The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Nicholas H. Almeida against M/S Lenzing Modi Fibres India Pvt. Ltd. regarding their proposed project for manufacturing Viscose Fibers with a Captive Power Plant in Maharashtra. Almeida raised concerns about the project's compliance with the RRZ Policy for location of industries and the government's resolution on maintaining a distance from rivers. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had granted Consent to Establish the industry, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests had accorded Environment Clearance subject to specific conditions. Almeida requested that the tribunal restrain the company from carrying out any activities in breach of the government's resolution.

The court order prohibits Respondent No.1 from carrying out any activities at Plot No.M-1 & M-2 MIDC, Additional Patlganga Industrial Area, Village Sarai, Tehsil Panvel, District Raigad, Maharashtra, in breach of the various provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the guidelines dated 9th February 2011 issued by MoEF. The court also directs Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation to withdraw the allotment of the industrial plot by them to Respondent No.1 and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to withdraw the Consent to Establish granted to Respondent No.1. The court also orders an investigation by a third party into how permission to start site preparation work was granted prior to grant EC and without prior clearance under Wildlife Protection Act. The court also addresses the issue of limitation and violation of the EC granted to the project by Project proponent by starting construction. The court forms a committee to address the issues of allegedly construction activities at the project site.

The court order discusses the distance between the Karnala Birds Sanctuary and a proposed project site, as well as the nearest distance between the project site and the Patalganga river. The report of a committee using Google Earth maps is accepted by the tribunal, and it is found that there is no evidence of illegal construction activity. The applicant's objection to the Consent to Establish is rejected, as they should have first approached the designated Appellate Authority. The location of the industry is found to be acceptable and not against the RRZ Notification. The validity of conditional clearance is discussed, and it is found that clearances from forestry and wildlife angles are independent of environmental clearance.

The court order requires project proponents to submit applications for diversion of forestland and wildlife clearance before seeking environmental clearance. The order also highlights a procedural irregularity in the grant of environmental clearance for a project in a coastal zone area and directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests to review air emission standards and conduct a specialized study on the impact of emissions on wildlife. The court also directs the ministry to complete procedural formalities for granting environmental clearance within eight weeks and to investigate the procedural lapse. The court rejects the contention that the role of the State Pollution Control Board is not activated until the unit becomes functional and the effluent treatment plant is commissioned.

The court order states that the State Board is required to ascertain the appropriateness of the industry location before granting consent under the Water Act and Air Act. The CRZ Notification 2011 is also important, as it highlights the role of SPCB in deciding the permissible activities under the CRZ Notification. The court directs the project proponent to submit the NIO report to MPCB in the next 7 days. The application is dismissed, but the MoEF shall study the industrial air emissions and air dispersion in the area of the proposed industry and Karnala Bird Sanctuary to satisfy itself whether establishment of the industry is ecologically sustainable. The issue of permission under CRZ notification 2011 and EIA Notification of 2006 shall be duly considered and decided within a period of 8 weeks hereafter independently, on merits thereof.
