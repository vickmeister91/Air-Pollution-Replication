The Punjab State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution filed a criminal complaint against M/s Mahalaxmi Industries for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The industry was emitting polluted air without obtaining consent and without installing air pollution control equipment. However, the trial court acquitted the accused, stating that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the accused. The Punjab-Haryana High Court heard the appeal and found that the accused had applied for necessary consent under the Act, but the consent was refused because the industry had not installed air pollution control equipment. The court also noted that the industry had been leased out to another company, which had obtained a No Objection Certificate for pollution. The court ultimately dismissed the appeal.
