The Supreme Court of India has admitted a batch of appeals arising from a decision of the National Green Tribunal regarding the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The appeals concern the use of forest land for drinking water and industrial purposes by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board. The Tribunal directed the Board to prohibit the use of water drawn under the forest clearance for industrial purposes, but clarified that the prohibition was only confined to industrial units.

The Court stayed the Tribunal's order insofar as the Tuticorin Thermal Power Plant is concerned, subject to the condition that drinking water needs are fully met. The Court directed the Board to file an affidavit indicating the extent of water available for distribution, the water required to fully meet drinking water needs, and any surplus available.

The court has called for fresh affidavits on the anticipated requirements of water for drinking and industrial use. An affidavit has been filed indicating that there is surplus water available for industrial use after meeting drinking water requirements. The court has been asked to modify the stay granted by the Tribunal to permit the release of water for industrial purposes subject to the drinking water needs being fully met.

The court has directed the Collector responsible for Thoothukudi division to convene a meeting of all concerned departments to ascertain whether any surplus water is available after fully meeting the requirement for drinking water. The Collector shall conduct a fortnightly review of the position thereafter to determine whether any further direction or modification is required to meet the exigencies of the situation.

The court order directs the allocation of a suitable quantity of water for industrial purposes without compromising the drinking water needs of residents. The interim order for the Tuticorin Thermal Power Plant will continue until the Collector makes a decision. A joint meeting between the State Government and TWAD Board will be held to resolve the proposal under the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. Any allocation of water for industrial purposes will abide by the final decision of the Union of India.

The appeals are disposed of with no order as to costs.
