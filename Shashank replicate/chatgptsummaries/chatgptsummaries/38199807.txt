The court order pertains to a petition filed by Sanjay Dhalet against Murari Lal Sain under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner had requested the court to set aside an order passed by the Court of Special Metropolitan Magistrate (N.I. Act Cases), No.3, Jaipur Metropolitan Jaipur, whereby the application of the petitioner under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was dismissed. The respondent had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act alleging that the petitioner had issued a cheque that had bounced. 

The petitioner had requested the trial court to direct the complainant to produce an agreement/document for effective cross-examination. The trial court rejected the application, and the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner argued that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application and that the complainant should have been directed to produce the agreement/document. 

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that since the complainant had denied possession of the document/agreement, the same had been rightly declined by the trial court. The court observed that the trial court had considered the arguments of both parties and had come to a reasoned conclusion. The court further noted that the petitioner had not been able to show any error in the decision of the trial court. 

The court also observed that the power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of the court or where the ends of justice require intervention. The court noted that in the present case, there was no such abuse of the process of the court or any miscarriage of justice. 

The court further observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that the petitioner could have approached the court under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to summon the document/agreement from the complainant. The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy and had instead chosen to file a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. 

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Sanjay Dhalet against Murari Lal Sain under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The court observed that the trial court had rightly declined the application of the petitioner under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and that there was no abuse of the process of the court or any miscarriage of justice. The court further noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and that he had not exhausted this remedy.
