The National Green Tribunal heard two applications challenging a notification issued by the Administrator of the Union Territory of Chandigarh in 2008, which prohibited the use, manufacture, storage, import, sale, or transportation of polythene/plastic carry bags in the UT of Chandigarh. The applicants, who were engaged in the manufacture and supply of virgin polythene bags, claimed that they did not deal with recycled plastic/polythene and that their products complied with relevant rules and/or notifications. They argued that they were dependent on their industry for their livelihood and had obtained consent under the Water and Air Acts. The Tribunal considered the constitutionality, legality, and correctness of the notification.

The court order discusses a ban on the manufacture and use of polythene carry bags in the UT of Chandigarh. The applicants challenged the ban, arguing that it was repugnant to the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules of 2011 and that there was no nexus between the ban and the object of controlling pollution. The respondents argued that plastic bags have devastating effects on the environment and that the ban is in the public interest. The court ultimately upheld the ban, stating that it is the duty of the authorities to adopt dynamic environmental protective measures and that the ban is in line with this duty.

The court order discusses a challenge to a notification issued by the Administrator, UT of Chandigarh in 2008, which banned the manufacture and sale of plastic carry bags. The court determines that the notification was issued in accordance with the law and is not in conflict with the Rules of 2011, which regulate the production and manufacture of plastic products. The court explains that the Environment Act gives the Central Government the power to issue directions to prevent environmental hazards, and the Rules of 2011 were framed in accordance with this power. The court also notes that the Rules of 2011 specify regulatory measures that must be followed for the manufacture and sale of plastic products.

The court order discusses the requirements and restrictions for registration as a manufacturer, stockist, or seller of plastic goods under the Rules of 2011 and the directions issued under Section 5 of the Environment Act. It states that both are complementary and supplementary to each other and aim to protect and improve the environment. The court also explains that the right to carry on trade is conditional and subject to reasonable restrictions, and that the notification of 30th July, 2008 is not repugnant to the Rules of 2011. The court further discusses the legislative competence of the Union Parliament and the State legislature in relation to the environment and the conditions required for an Act to be declared void on account of repugnancy under the Constitution.

The court order discusses the inconsistency between two notifications, one issued by UT Chandigarh and the other by the Rules of 2011, regarding the banning of plastic carry bags. The court concludes that there is no clear and direct inconsistency between the two notifications and that they operate in different fields with different objectives. The court also determines that Article 254 of the Constitution is not applicable in this case as the subject of environment is not specifically listed in either of the Lists. The court rejects the argument that the notification dated 30th July, 2008 is repugnant to the Rules of 2011 and that it stands impliedly over-ruled by the latter. The court cites the principles leading to repeal of a statute or a provision by implication and concludes that the two notifications can exist side by side as they operate in their respective fields with different aims and objectives.

The court order discusses a ban on polythene carry bags in the UT of Chandigarh and whether it is discriminatory or arbitrary. The court finds that the ban is based on rational studies and has a direct nexus to the object sought to be achieved under the provisions of the Environment Act. The court also notes that many countries have introduced legislation to limit the use of plastic bags. The court dismisses the applications challenging the ban and directs the authorities concerned in all states to explore the possibility of introducing the use of bio-degradable or compostable plastic bags instead of polythene plastic bags.

In summary, the court orders discussed the ban on the use, manufacture, storage, import, sale, or transportation of polythene/plastic carry bags in the UT of Chandigarh. The applicants challenged the ban, arguing that it was repugnant to the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules of 2011 and that there was no nexus between the ban and the object of controlling pollution. However, the court ultimately upheld the ban, stating that it is the duty of the authorities to adopt dynamic environmental protective measures and that the ban is in line with this duty. The court also determined that the notification was issued in accordance with the law and is not in conflict with the Rules of 2011. The court further discussed the legislative competence of the Union Parliament and the State legislature in relation to the environment and the conditions required for an Act to be declared void on account of repugnancy under the Constitution. The court dismissed the applications challenging the ban and directed the authorities concerned in all states to explore the possibility of introducing the use of bio-degradable or compostable plastic bags instead of polythene plastic bags.
