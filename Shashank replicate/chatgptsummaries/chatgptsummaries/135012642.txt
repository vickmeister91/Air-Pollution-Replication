The court order pertains to two separate cases where the plaintiffs had applied for industrial plots under the relocation scheme of industries but were rejected by the defendants. In the first case, Sh. Babu Lal Jain had applied for an industrial plot but was rejected due to the location of his unit in a local commercial area. The plaintiff requested a refund of the earnest money but did not receive it. The plaintiff filed a suit for mandatory injunction, directing the defendants to hold his unit eligible for the allotment of a plot and relocate it to a confirming use zone. 

The court heard both parties and found that the suit was not barred by limitation and granted the mandatory injunction as prayed for by the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff had applied for an industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries and had deposited the earnest money. The plaintiff's application was rejected on the ground that his unit was located in a local commercial area. The plaintiff had requested a refund of the earnest money, but the same was not refunded. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to the refund of the earnest money and directed the defendants to refund the same to the plaintiff.

In the second case, the plaintiff had sent several letters to the defendants for reopening his case, but the defendants did not consider his case. The defendants contended that the plaintiff's unit was not found operative as per their policy, and hence his application was rejected. The plaintiff did not challenge the rejection of his application within three years, and hence the suit was time-barred. The court found in favor of the defendants and dismissed the plaintiff's suit.
