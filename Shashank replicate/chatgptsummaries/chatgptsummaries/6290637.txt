The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Sri Sai Saptagiri Sponge Pvt. Ltd against the State of Karnataka and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had challenged the judgment of the Appellate Authority under Water and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts, 1974 and 1981, in Appeal Nos.16-17/2012 and 42-43/2012. The petitioner had prayed for quashing the orders dated 02.07.2012 and 09.10.2012, refusing consent for operation of the petitioner's plant under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court observed that the petitioner had proposed to follow the positive and constructive course of applying afresh for necessary permission and consent under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act with fees and submission of necessary documents. The court disposed of the petitions after recording the above observations and statements, with no order as to costs.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and complying with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court has emphasized that the petitioner must apply afresh for necessary permission and consent, and submit all necessary documents and fees. This is in line with the objective of the Acts, which is to prevent and control pollution and protect the environment.

The court's decision also underscores the need for companies to be responsible and accountable for their actions. The petitioner had challenged the orders refusing consent for operation of their plant, but the court has made it clear that they must follow due process and comply with the provisions of the Acts. This is a reminder to all companies that they must operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, and take all necessary steps to prevent and control pollution.

Overall, the court order is a positive development in the fight against pollution and environmental degradation. It reinforces the importance of following due process and complying with the provisions of the Acts, and sends a strong message to companies that they must be responsible and accountable for their actions. It is hoped that this decision will encourage other companies to take similar steps to prevent and control pollution, and protect the environment for future generations.
