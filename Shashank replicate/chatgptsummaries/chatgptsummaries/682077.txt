The original complaint was filed against Tilok Textiles Ltd and another for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

The appeal was dismissed and bail bonds were cancelled.

The case in question pertains to a complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against Tilok Textiles Ltd and another for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The complaint was filed in 2006, and the trial court had dismissed it in 2019 for want of prosecution. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had then filed an appeal against the dismissal of their complaint.

The Gujarat High Court, while dismissing the appeal, observed that the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint due to the appellant's failure to serve summons and warrants and provide proper explanation for non-prosecution after a 13-year delay. The court noted that the appellant had failed to take any steps to prosecute the complaint for a period of 13 years, and had not even bothered to provide any explanation for the delay. The court also observed that the appellant had failed to serve summons and warrants on the accused, and had not taken any steps to ensure their presence in court.

The court further noted that the appellant had not even bothered to file an application for condonation of delay, which would have allowed them to explain the reasons for the delay and seek an extension of time to prosecute the complaint. The court observed that the appellant had not shown any diligence or seriousness in prosecuting the complaint, and had failed to take any steps to ensure that the accused were brought to justice.

The court also observed that the appellant had not provided any explanation for the delay in filing the appeal against the dismissal of their complaint. The court noted that the appeal had been filed after a delay of more than six months, and that the appellant had not even bothered to explain the reasons for the delay.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the appeal and cancelled the bail bonds furnished by the appellant. The court observed that the appellant had failed to show any diligence or seriousness in prosecuting the complaint, and had not taken any steps to ensure that the accused were brought to justice. The court also noted that the appellant had not provided any explanation for the delay in filing the appeal, and had not even bothered to file an application for condonation of delay.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of diligence and seriousness in prosecuting complaints filed under environmental laws.
