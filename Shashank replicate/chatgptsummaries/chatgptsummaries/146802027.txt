The court order pertains to two criminal original petitions filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is facing a criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and has filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to issue summons to the complainant to produce his Income Tax returns and Bank Account statement during the relevant period. The Court below has dismissed the said petition on the ground that the petitioner has admitted to borrowing Rs.1,20,00,000/- from the complainant and cannot insist the complainant to produce the Income Tax Returns since the complainant may or may not have shown this transaction in the Income Tax Returns.

The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to issue summons to the complainant to produce his Income Tax returns and Bank Account statement during the relevant period. However, the court below dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioner had admitted to borrowing Rs.1,20,00,000/- from the complainant and cannot insist the complainant to produce the Income Tax Returns since the complainant may or may not have shown this transaction in the Income Tax Returns. The petitioner had argued that the complainant had not produced any evidence to show that the transaction was reflected in his Income Tax returns and that the production of the Income Tax returns was necessary to establish the source of funds for the transaction.

The court considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and concluded that the petitioner need not file a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C and force the complainant to produce the relevant books of accounts/Income Tax returns. The court found that the previous findings dismissing the petition under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C were only prima facie and should not influence the court's decision on the merits of the case.

The court directed the lower court to continue with the proceedings and independently examine the grounds raised by the petitioner regarding the cheque transactions. The court also ordered the lower court to complete the proceedings within three months. The Criminal Original Petitions were disposed of and the connected miscellaneous petitions were closed.
