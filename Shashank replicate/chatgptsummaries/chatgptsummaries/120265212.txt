The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by four individuals against the closure of a road passing through the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve in Chhattisgarh. The closure was ordered by the Collector-cum-District Magistrate, Bilaspur, to protect the wildlife and environment of the reserve. The petitioners argued that the closure violated their fundamental right to movement. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the closure order, citing the Tiger Conservation Plan approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The court also noted that alternative routes had been provided and that local residents were still permitted to use the road with passes.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in relation to the restriction of entry into a sanctuary or national park. It states that while restrictions on entry can be imposed by the Chief Wild Life Warden, there is no provision for a district magistrate to prohibit entry into a sanctuary or national park along a public highway. The court also notes that the right to freedom of movement is guaranteed by the Constitution of India and can only be restricted if it is necessary in the interest of public safety or convenience. The court concludes that the district magistrate does not have the power to prohibit entry into a public highway passing through a sanctuary or national park.

The court order discusses the legal provisions related to the prohibition or restriction of the use of motor vehicles on specified roads or areas. It emphasizes the mandatory requirement of publishing a notification in the Official Gazette for any such prohibition or restriction that is to remain in force for more than one month. The court also cites previous judgments that highlight the need for exercising power under the relevant statutes judiciously and reasonably, with minimum and reasonable restrictions that match the avowed objective. The court ultimately concludes that the order of total prohibition of movement of vehicles on a specified route by the District Magistrate is without jurisdiction and authority of law, as it was not based on any reasons related to public safety or convenience or the nature of the road, and the mandatory requirement of publishing a notification in the Official Gazette was not complied with.

The court order states that the Collector-cum-District Magistrate had no jurisdiction to prohibit the usage of public vehicles on the Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi Highway without complying with the mandatory provision of publishing a notification in the Official Gazette. The order quashes the Collector's decision and directs them to make the route usable for citizens while restricting its usage for highway purposes only. The order also states that the competent authority can proceed in accordance with the law. The writ petition is allowed, and the parties will bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed against the closure of a road passing through the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve in Chhattisgarh. The court upheld the closure order, citing the Tiger Conservation Plan approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. However, the court also emphasized the need for exercising power under relevant statutes judiciously and reasonably, with minimum and reasonable restrictions that match the avowed objective. The court concluded that the district magistrate does not have the power to prohibit entry into a public highway passing through a sanctuary or national park. The court also emphasized the mandatory requirement of publishing a notification in the Official Gazette for any prohibition or restriction of the use of motor vehicles on specified roads or areas. The court quashed the Collector's decision to prohibit the usage of public vehicles on the Kota-Achanakmar-Kevchi Highway without complying with the mandatory provision of publishing a notification in the Official Gazette and directed them to make the route usable for citizens while restricting its usage for highway purposes only.
