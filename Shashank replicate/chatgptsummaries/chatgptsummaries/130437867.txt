The High Court recently issued an order in a case involving the illegal transportation of sand and various offenses registered against the owner of the vehicle used for the transportation. The owner had filed an application seeking interim custody of the vehicle, which was dismissed by the lower court. However, the High Court has now directed that the vehicle be released to the owner on supurdiginama, subject to certain conditions.

The court has directed the owner to furnish a personal bond and a bank guarantee, and to provide an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used in any anti-social activities. Additionally, the owner has been instructed to produce the original registration and sale-letter and to get the vehicle photographed in the presence of a responsible officer.

The case began when the vehicle was seized for illegal transportation of sand and various offenses were registered against the owner. The owner then filed an application seeking interim custody of the vehicle, which was dismissed by the lower court. The owner then approached the High Court seeking relief.

The High Court considered the facts of the case and the arguments put forth by both parties. The court noted that the owner had not been convicted of any offense related to the vehicle and that the vehicle had been seized only for the purpose of investigation. The court also observed that the owner had a legitimate interest in the vehicle and that the vehicle was not required for the investigation.

In light of these considerations, the High Court directed that the vehicle be released to the owner on supurdiginama, subject to certain conditions. The court noted that the purpose of the conditions was to ensure that the vehicle was not used for any illegal activities and that the owner would cooperate with the investigation.

The court directed the owner to furnish a personal bond and a bank guarantee as a security for the vehicle. The court also directed the owner to provide an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used in any anti-social activities. The court further directed the owner to produce the original registration and sale-letter and to get the vehicle photographed in the presence of a responsible officer.

The court emphasized that the owner must comply with all the conditions imposed by the court. The court warned that any violation of the conditions would result in the cancellation of the supurdiginama and the seizure of the vehicle.

In conclusion, the High Court has directed that the vehicle be released to the owner on supurdiginama, subject to certain conditions. The court has emphasized that the purpose of the conditions is to ensure that the vehicle is not used for any illegal activities and that the owner cooperates with the investigation. The court has also warned that any violation of the conditions would result in the cancellation of the supurdiginama and the seizure of the vehicle.
