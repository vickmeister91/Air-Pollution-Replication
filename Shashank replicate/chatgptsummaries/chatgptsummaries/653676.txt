The court order in question pertains to a revision-petition against an order issued by the learned Sessions Judge, Bikaner, in a case where Luna Ram and his family members were threatening Pema Ram Jat. Pema Ram Jat had lodged a complaint with the police station, Jamsar, and the police had recommended proceedings under Section 107/.51, Cr. P.C. The learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Bikaner, had issued notices under Section 112, Cr. P.C. calling upon Luna Ram and others to show cause why they should not be bound over in a sum of Rs. 2000/-, and to furnish a surety in the like amount to keep the peace for a period of one year.

The petitioners felt aggrieved by the above order and approached the Court of Learned Sessions Judge, Bikaner, through a revision-application. The court order discusses the legality of the arrest of Luna Ram and Ganga Ram under Section 107, read with Section 151, Cr. P.C. and the importance of following the procedure laid down in Sections 112 to 118 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The court ultimately quashes the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Bikaner (North) dated January 28, 1971, as well as that of Sessions Judge, Bikaner, dated July 28, 1971. The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures in cases involving threats and violence.

The court order begins by discussing the facts of the case. Luna Ram and his family members had allegedly threatened Pema Ram Jat, who had lodged a complaint with the police station, Jamsar. The police had recommended proceedings under Section 107/.51, Cr. P.C. The learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Bikaner, had issued notices under Section 112, Cr. P.C. calling upon Luna Ram and others to show cause why they should not be bound over in a sum of Rs. 2000/-, and to furnish a surety in the like amount to keep the peace for a period of one year.

The petitioners, Luna Ram and Ganga Ram, felt aggrieved by the above order and approached the Court of Learned Sessions Judge, Bikaner, through a revision-application. The court order then discusses the legality of the arrest of Luna Ram and Ganga Ram under Section 107, read with Section 151, Cr. P.C.

The court notes that the arrest of Luna Ram and Ganga Ram was made under Section 107, read with Section 151, Cr. P.C. The court observes that the provisions of Section 107, Cr. P.C. are intended to prevent the commission of a breach of the peace or disturbance of public tranquillity. The court notes that the provisions of Section 151, Cr. P.C. empower a police officer to arrest a person without a warrant if he has reason to believe that the person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb public tranquillity.

The court then goes on to discuss the importance of following the procedure laid down in Sections 112 to 118 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court notes that Section 112, Cr. P.C. requires the Magistrate to issue a notice to the person against whom proceedings are sought to be taken, calling upon him to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond for keeping the peace. The court observes that the object of the notice is to give the person concerned an opportunity to show cause why he should not be bound over to keep the peace.

The court notes that Luna Ram and others were issued notices under Section 112, Cr. P.C. calling upon them to show cause why they should not be bound over in a sum of Rs. 2000/-, and to furnish a surety in the like amount to keep the peace for a period of one year. The court observes that the object of the notice is to give the person concerned an opportunity to show cause why he should not be bound over to keep the peace.

The court then goes on to discuss the procedure to be followed in cases where the person against whom proceedings are sought to be taken fails to appear in response to the notice issued under Section 112, Cr. P.C. The court notes that Section 117, Cr. P.C. provides that if the person against whom proceedings are sought to be taken fails to appear in response to the notice issued under Section 112, Cr. P.C., the Magistrate may issue a warrant for his arrest.

The court observes that in the present case, Luna Ram and Ganga Ram were arrested without following the procedure laid down in Sections 112 to 118 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court notes that Luna Ram and Ganga Ram were not given an opportunity to show cause why they should not be bound over to keep the peace. The court observes that the arrest of Luna Ram and Ganga Ram was therefore illegal.

The court ultimately quashes the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Bikaner (North) dated January 28, 1971, as well as that of Sessions Judge, Bikaner, dated July 28, 1971. The court observes that the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, B
