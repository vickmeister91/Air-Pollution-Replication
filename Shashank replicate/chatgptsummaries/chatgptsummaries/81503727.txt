The Supreme Court of India has recently disposed of two special leave petitions filed by Sheila Dhody against the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority and others. The petitioner had challenged an order of demolition of structures passed by the Authority under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The High Court had dismissed the writ petitions and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal. The petitioner had sought an extension of time for approaching the Tribunal, which was rejected by the High Court. 

The Supreme Court has granted four weeks' time to the petitioner for filing an appeal before the Tribunal and has ordered the interim order operating in favor of the petitioner to continue for a further period of four weeks or till the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal, whichever is earlier. The Court has not expressed any opinion on the contentions raised by the petitioner or the merits of the appeal.

The case revolves around the issue of demolition of structures in the coastal zone of Goa. The petitioner, Sheila Dhody, had challenged the order of demolition passed by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The High Court had dismissed the writ petitions and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal. The petitioner had sought an extension of time for approaching the Tribunal, which was rejected by the High Court.

The Supreme Court has now granted four weeks' time to the petitioner for filing an appeal before the Tribunal. The Court has also ordered the interim order operating in favor of the petitioner to continue for a further period of four weeks or till the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal, whichever is earlier. This means that the structures in question will not be demolished for the next four weeks, or until the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal.

It is important to note that the Supreme Court has not expressed any opinion on the contentions raised by the petitioner or the merits of the appeal. The Court has simply granted the petitioner four weeks' time to file an appeal before the Tribunal and has ordered the interim order to continue for a further period of four weeks or till the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal, whichever is earlier.

The issue of demolition of structures in the coastal zone of Goa is a contentious one. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority has been tasked with ensuring that the coastal zone is protected and preserved. This includes ensuring that structures are not built in the coastal zone without the necessary permissions and approvals.

The petitioner, Sheila Dhody, had built structures in the coastal zone without the necessary permissions and approvals. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority had issued an order of demolition of these structures under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner had challenged this order of demolition in the High Court, which had dismissed the writ petitions and directed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal.

The petitioner had sought an extension of time for approaching the Tribunal, which was rejected by the High Court. The petitioner then approached the Supreme Court, which has now granted four weeks' time to the petitioner for filing an appeal before the Tribunal and has ordered the interim order to continue for a further period of four weeks or till the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal, whichever is earlier.

It remains to be seen what the outcome of the appeal before the Tribunal will be. The issue of demolition of structures in the coastal zone of Goa is a complex one, and there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. The Tribunal will need to carefully consider all the facts and arguments presented before it before arriving at a decision.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has disposed of two special leave petitions filed by Sheila Dhody against the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority and others. The Court has granted four weeks' time to the petitioner for filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal and has ordered the interim order operating in favor of the petitioner to continue for a further period of four weeks or till the appeal is taken up by the Tribunal, whichever is earlier. The Court has not expressed any opinion on the contentions raised by the petitioner or the merits of the appeal. The issue of demolition of structures in the coastal zone of Goa is a contentious one, and it remains to be seen what the outcome of the appeal before the Tribunal will be.
