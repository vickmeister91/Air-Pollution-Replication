The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Wale, also known as Satendra, against an order passed by the II Additional Sessions Judge. The order in question dismissed Wale's application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Wale had requested that an enquiry report be called for, as one of the accused, Raji, also known as Mukesh, was not made an accused in the case.

The court held that an accused can only move an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to call for a document that is necessary for the disposal of the trial. As the enquiry report was not required for the disposal of the case, the application was dismissed. The revision filed by Wale was also dismissed.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue a summons or order for the production of a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section allows the court to call for any document or thing that it deems necessary for the purposes of the case.

In this case, Wale had requested that an enquiry report be called for as one of the accused, Raji, was not made an accused in the case. The court, however, held that the enquiry report was not necessary for the disposal of the case and therefore dismissed the application.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The section clearly states that the court can only call for a document or thing that is necessary for the disposal of the case. In this case, the enquiry report was not necessary for the disposal of the case, and therefore the court dismissed the application.

Wale then filed a revision against the order passed by the II Additional Sessions Judge. However, the revision was also dismissed by the court. The court's decision was based on the same grounds as the earlier order. The court held that the enquiry report was not necessary for the disposal of the case, and therefore the revision was dismissed.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Wale against an order passed by the II Additional Sessions Judge. The order in question dismissed Wale's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court held that the enquiry report was not necessary for the disposal of the case, and therefore the application was dismissed. The revision filed by Wale was also dismissed on the same grounds. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which clearly states that the court can only call for a document or thing that is necessary for the disposal of the case.
