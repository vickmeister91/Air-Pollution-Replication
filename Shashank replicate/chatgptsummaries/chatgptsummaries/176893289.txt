The case of Jagan vs The State of Madhya Pradesh has been ongoing for some time, and this recent court order marks a significant development in the proceedings. The accused, Jagan, had previously been sentenced to jail time, but had already served more than 8 months of his sentence and was on bail during the trial and appellate court. In this latest court order, the court has granted Jagan bail on the condition of depositing the fine amount and furnishing a personal bond.

It is worth noting that the court has also allowed the repeat application filed by the accused for suspension of his jail sentence. This suggests that Jagan had previously filed an application for suspension of his sentence, but it had been denied. However, with this latest court order, Jagan has been granted bail, indicating that the court has reconsidered his case and decided to grant him some relief.

The court has directed Jagan to appear before the Court of C.J.M., Burhanpur on 30.11.2015 and on all other subsequent dates fixed by the court during the pendency of the revision. This means that Jagan will need to attend court hearings as required by the court, and failure to do so could result in further legal consequences.

Overall, this court order represents a significant development in the case of Jagan vs The State of Madhya Pradesh. The fact that the court has granted Jagan bail suggests that there may be some merit to his case, and it will be interesting to see how the proceedings unfold in the coming weeks and months. It is clear that Jagan will need to comply with the court's directives and attend all required court hearings, and it remains to be seen whether he will ultimately be found guilty or innocent of the charges against him.
