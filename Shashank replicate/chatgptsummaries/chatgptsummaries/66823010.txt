In a recent court order, Nirmal Basumatary sought condonation of delay of 13 days in filing a criminal appeal against his conviction under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court heard the applicant's counsel and has condoned the delay. However, the respondent No. 2 was not served notice as it was repeatedly returned unserved.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. It also provides for penalties for offences related to wildlife, including hunting, poaching, and trafficking.

In this case, Nirmal Basumatary was convicted under the Act and sought to file a criminal appeal against his conviction. However, he was delayed in filing the appeal by 13 days. The court heard his counsel and decided to condone the delay, allowing him to file the appeal.

The decision to condone the delay is significant as it shows that the court is willing to consider the circumstances of the case and make a decision based on the merits of the appeal. It also highlights the importance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 in protecting wildlife and their habitats.

However, the fact that respondent No. 2 was not served notice is a cause for concern. It is unclear why the notice was repeatedly returned unserved, but it raises questions about the effectiveness of the legal system in ensuring that all parties are properly notified of court proceedings.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 in protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the need for the legal system to ensure that all parties are properly notified of court proceedings. It also shows that the court is willing to consider the circumstances of the case and make a decision based on the merits of the appeal.
