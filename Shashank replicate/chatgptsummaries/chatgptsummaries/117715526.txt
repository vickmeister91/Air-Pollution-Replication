The court order pertains to four different cases related to environmental pollution and industrial operations in Tripura. In the first case, two partners of a rice mill filed a writ petition challenging the closure order issued by the Tripura State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioners contended that the closure order was issued illegally and arbitrarily without any scientific inquiry. The appellate authority made observations on perusal of the inspection report and found that the mill was still being operated in violation of the closure order. The court heard arguments from both sides and delivered an oral judgment and order.

In the second case, the court discussed observations made by the Appellate Authority during meetings held in April and May 2013 regarding a mill that was in violation of a closure order issued by the TSPCB in 2012. The mill was found to be causing noise and air pollution, and the modifications made by the mill owner were deemed cosmetic and not effective in reducing pollution levels. The mill was also found to be lacking in proper management of ash contents and fire safety measures. The court ordered the mill owner to undertake planting of trees and to find permanent solutions to reduce pollution levels to prevent health hazards to local residents.

In the third case, the court ordered the owners of M/S. Joyram Rice Mill to shift their mill from its current location in a residential area to a suitable location within authorized commercial industrial units. The owners have been given a maximum of nine months to complete the shifting process and must comply with all mandatory rules and regulations for running an industrial unit, including pollution control, fire protection, labor welfare, electricity safeguard, and health care of workers. The TSPCB has been directed to make fortnightly visits to the mill to assess compliance and report to the authority. The closure order issued by the TSPCB is stayed until the shifting is completed, but if the owners do not comply with the recommendations, the closure order will be reinstated.

In the fourth case, a writ petition was filed against an order that allowed industrial units to operate near residential areas. The petitioners argued that the order was arbitrary and took away their right to livelihood. The respondents argued that an appeal could be made to the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court concluded that the writ petition was not maintainable and dismissed it, stating that there was a substantive provision for filing an appeal under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act. The court also noted that there shall be no order as to costs.

Overall, the court orders reflect the importance of environmental protection and the need for industrial units to comply with pollution control regulations. The court has taken a strict stance on violations of closure orders and has ordered the shifting of industrial units from residential areas to prevent health hazards to local residents. The court has also emphasized the need for permanent solutions to reduce pollution levels and has directed the TSPCB to monitor compliance with pollution control regulations. The court has also clarified the procedure for filing appeals under the National Green Tribunal Act and has dismissed writ petitions that are not maintainable.
