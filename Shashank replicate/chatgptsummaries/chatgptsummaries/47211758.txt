The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving unauthorized construction and the need for adherence to regulations and laws in building construction activity. 

In the first court order, a municipal councilor in Gujarat filed a writ-application alleging unauthorized construction by private respondents without valid permission. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, direction or order in the nature of writ, enjoining upon the concerned respondents to take swift and stringent action to put an end to any further construction not only in respect of such constructions, but also, enjoin upon the respondents not to permit any new unauthorized construction(s) forthwith and direct demolition of the constructions already made. The respondent no.6-Dhoraji Municipality filed an affidavit-in-reply, stating that the respondent nos.8 to 11 had applied for permission to construct a fourth floor, which is pending before the Town Planning Committee for approval. The respondent nos.12 to 16 had submitted an application for development to construct 2nd and 3rd floors on the said premises, and the revised plan is pending before the Town Planning Committee for approval. The court did not order the circulation of the judgment to reporters or civil judges.

The second court order discusses the responses of various respondents to a petition filed by the petitioner regarding the construction of a school building. The respondents argue that the petitioner has not approached the court with clean hands and has suppressed vital facts, including criminal activities. The court considers whether the petitioner is entitled to any relief and notes that public interest litigation should only be allowed if the action complained of is illegal or mala fide and affects a group of persons who cannot protect their own interests.

The third court order discusses a case where a group of people constructed a fourth floor without valid permission from the Dhoraji Municipality. The court rejected the argument that the construction was deemed permissible due to the municipality's failure to respond to the application for permission. The court cited previous cases where unauthorized construction was ordered to be demolished, even if the builder had invested a considerable amount. The court emphasized that judicial discretion must be exercised in accordance with the law and set legal principles.

The fourth court order states that an appeal by a developer claiming that permission to develop their plot should be deemed granted because the Planning Authority failed to communicate its decision within 60 days cannot be upheld. The court found that the matter of granting permission was still under consideration and the plans submitted by the developer may not have been in accordance with relevant regulations. The court also cites previous cases where illegal and unauthorized constructions have become a menace and emphasizes the importance of planned development and adherence to regulations. The court notes that those who violate regulations put a burden on public facilities and amenities and cause harm to the environment and public health. The court also criticizes the role of builders who construct illegally and dupe innocent buyers.

The fifth court order discusses the importance of planned development of cities and regulating building construction activity. It notes that deviations from sanctioned constructions should be kept to a minimum and that deliberate deviations by professional builders should be dealt with sternly to act as a deterrent for future violations. The order directs the demolition of illegal and unauthorized constructions put up by certain respondents and emphasizes the need for punishment of delinquent officers who allowed such constructions to be made. The order also cites previous court cases and observations made by the Supreme Court on the importance of enforcing laws and protecting the environment.

In all of these court orders, the need for adherence to regulations and laws in building construction activity is emphasized. The court orders also stress the importance of planned development of cities and the need to protect the environment and public health. The court orders direct the demolition of illegal and unauthorized constructions and emphasize the need for punishment of delinquent officers who allowed such constructions to be made.
