The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to cases involving hazardous or inherently dangerous activities and the resulting harm caused to individuals and communities. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Jaipur Golden Gas Victims Association seeking compensation for victims of a fire tragedy caused by a chemical gas leak from a godown. The petitioner also requested the identification and prosecution of officials responsible for the tragedy and the implementation of recommendations to prevent future tragedies. The court ordered compensation for the deceased and interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of the petition until realization.

The second court order states the compensation amounts for the families of three individuals who died in a fire caused by a godown storing pesticides without proper permission. The total compensation amounts to Rs. 8,33,801/- for one individual, Rs. 4,65,801/- for another, and Rs. 5,93,801/- for the third, along with interest at 7.5% per annum. The respondent-MCD claims that the fire was caused by the respondent no. 5 storing pesticide boxes, but the latter argues that they had been using the godown since 1998 and had filed for a license in 1998, which was not granted. The respondent no. 5 also claims that the fire was caused by an electrical spark and that the deceased individuals were already suffering from tuberculosis. The respondent no. 5 had entered into settlement agreements with the affected persons and paid them compensation. The court also notes that the respondent no. 5 had violated Section 417 of the DMC Act by using the premises as a godown without proper permission.

The third court order states that no premises can be used for certain purposes without a license granted by the Commissioner. The order also references a fire and gas emission incident in a godown where pesticides were stored, resulting in hospitalizations and one death. The police lodged an FIR against the godown owner for negligence and storing combustible chemicals without taking precautions.

The fourth court order includes information about the action taken by the police in a case involving the death of a person due to inhalation of poisonous gases. The FSL report confirmed the presence of Aluminum Phosphide and Zinc Phosphide in the exhibits tested. The subsequent opinion given by a doctor confirmed that the cause of death was respiratory distress caused by phosphide poisoning. The court order also includes information about Aluminum Phosphide, a solid fumigant pesticide, insecticide, and rodenticide that is widely used as a grain preservative and is a systemic poison that affects all organs of the body.

The fifth court order discusses a writ petition filed in relation to a gas tragedy caused by Aluminum Phosphide. The order rejects objections of limitation and locus standi, and also dismisses the plea that the criminal trial would be prejudiced by the writ proceedings. The court also rejects the argument that the victims were silent spectators to the running of the godown and therefore could not claim compensation. The court further rejects the argument that a voluntary settlement had been executed and therefore the respondent was not liable to pay compensation. The court reproduces a sample agreement executed between the respondent and an affected party.

The sixth court order involves an agreement between two parties where the first party receives Rs. 5000 in cash and agrees not to claim any amount from the second party or file any legal proceedings against them. The court also lists individuals who received insignificant compensation and states that the agreements are unfair, unreasonable, unconscionable, opposed to public policy, and void. The court determines that the present writ petition is maintainable and that monetary relief can be awarded in the present writ petition. The court also states that compensation can be awarded in Article 226 proceedings.

The seventh court order discusses the power of High Courts to issue writs and other orders in India, and the ability to mold relief to meet the needs of the country. The court also discusses the concept of compensation under public law for injuries caused by negligence or violation of fundamental rights. The court cites the Ryland Vs. Fletcher rule, which holds a person liable for damage caused by anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, and applies it to the storage of chemical pesticides. The court also cites the principle evolved in M.C. Mehta's case, which holds enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industries liable for accidents that cause injury or death.

The eighth court order discusses the principle of liability for harm caused by hazardous or inherently dangerous industries. The court states that the rule of liability evolved in the 19th century is not applicable in a modern industrial society with highly developed scientific knowledge and technology. The court holds that an enterprise engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone. The enterprise must be held strictly liable for causing harm as a part of the social cost of carrying on the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity. The court also states that the law has to evolve to meet the needs of a fast-changing society and cannot afford to remain static.

The ninth court order discusses the principle of strict liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous activities. The court cites various cases and reports to support the idea that enterprises engaged in such activities owe an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone. The court holds that the respondent in this case, who stored chemical pesticides,
