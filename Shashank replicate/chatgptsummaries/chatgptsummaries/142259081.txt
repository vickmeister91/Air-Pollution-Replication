The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to cases involving the surrender of lands held in excess of the ceiling area and the rights of transferees in agricultural holdings. In the first case, the appellant was directed to surrender lands held by him in excess of the ceiling area. However, the District Collector refused to accept the option given by the appellant to surrender the lands held by him in excess of the ceiling area on the ground that the lands offered for surrender were not unencumbered. The court considered whether a person holding land under a transfer deed that is not in conformity with the provisions of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or other laws governing the manner in which transfers are to be effected, acquires any right which can be considered to be an encumbrance for the purposes of the second proviso to Section 30E(2) of the Act of 1955 or u/s 16(4) read with Section 18 of the Act of 1973.

The court held that the provisions of the Ceiling Act do not affect the inter-se relation between the transferor and transferee. So long as the lands are not acquired under the Ceiling Act, the rights existing between the transferor and transferee remain intact. This means that even if the transfer deed is not in conformity with the provisions of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or other laws governing the manner in which transfers are to be effected, the transferee still has a right to protect their possession over the land in question. The court clarified that the provisions of the Ceiling Act do not affect the rights of the transferee and that the transferor cannot exercise an option to surrender the land in possession of the transferees under the contract and retain the unencumbered land in their possession.

In the second case, the court discussed the rights of transferees in agricultural holdings and their right to protect their possession from any claim made by the transferors. The court clarified that even if an instrument of transfer is defective and has not been executed and completed in the manner prescribed by law, the transferee has a right to protect their possession over the land in question. The court dismissed the special appeal and stated that the act of the transfer being the landholder's own act, they cannot be permitted to exercise an option to surrender the land in possession of the transferees under the contract and retain the unencumbered land in their possession.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of protecting the rights of transferees in agricultural holdings and ensuring that their possession is not affected by any claims made by the transferors. The court also clarifies that the provisions of the Ceiling Act do not affect the rights of the transferee and that the transferor cannot exercise an option to surrender the land in possession of the transferees under the contract and retain the unencumbered land in their possession. These court orders provide important guidance for individuals involved in land transfers and highlight the need to ensure that all transfers are executed and completed in accordance with the law.
