The court order in question pertains to a case between two individuals, Rajkumar and Shravan Kumar. Rajkumar is facing trial for an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. During the trial, Rajkumar requested the complainant, Shravan Kumar, to produce an agreement related to an i10 car. However, this request was dismissed by both the trial court and the revisional court.

The reason for the dismissal was that the original document was not available. As a result, the applicant, Rajkumar, was allowed to proceed with adducing secondary evidence if deemed fit. However, despite this allowance, the petition was ultimately dismissed.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act deals with the dishonor of a cheque for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. In this case, it appears that Rajkumar had issued a cheque to Shravan Kumar, which was subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds. As a result, Rajkumar was facing trial for this offense.

During the trial, Rajkumar requested that Shravan Kumar produce an agreement related to an i10 car. It is unclear from the court order what the relevance of this agreement was to the case at hand. However, it is clear that the request was dismissed by both the trial court and the revisional court.

The reason for the dismissal was that the original document was not available. This means that Shravan Kumar was unable to produce the agreement in question. As a result, Rajkumar was allowed to proceed with adducing secondary evidence if deemed fit.

Secondary evidence refers to evidence that is not the original document but is instead a copy or a substitute. In this case, Rajkumar would have been allowed to present a copy of the agreement or some other form of evidence that would serve as a substitute for the original document.

Despite this allowance, the petition was ultimately dismissed. It is unclear from the court order why the petition was dismissed. However, it is possible that the secondary evidence presented by Rajkumar was not deemed sufficient to prove his case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case between Rajkumar and Shravan Kumar, where Rajkumar is facing trial for an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. During the trial, Rajkumar requested the complainant to produce an agreement related to an i10 car, which was dismissed by the trial court and the revisional court. As the original document is not available, the applicant may proceed to adduce secondary evidence if deemed fit. However, despite this allowance, the petition was ultimately dismissed.
