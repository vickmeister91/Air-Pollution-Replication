The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order in a case pertaining to a petition filed by Ch. Ashlesh Verma and another individual seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint was filed against them and M/s Agilent Technologies (International) Pvt. Ltd. for violating a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment relating to the environment impact assessment.

The petitioners contended that they had resigned as directors of the company in 2001 and were not associated with it in any manner when the violation occurred. They argued that they could not be held liable for the actions of the company after their resignation. The court allowed the petition and quashed the complaint and summoning order against the petitioners only.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had resigned from the company before the violation occurred and were not involved in any way with the company's actions. The court held that the complaint against them was not maintainable and that they could not be held liable for the company's actions.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the liability of directors who have resigned from a company. The court has made it clear that directors cannot be held liable for the actions of the company after their resignation, provided they can prove that they were not involved in any way with the company's actions.

The court's decision is also significant as it highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations. The court has made it clear that violations of environmental regulations will not be tolerated and that those responsible will be held accountable.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for directors who have resigned from a company and for the environment. It clarifies the liability of directors and sends a strong message that environmental violations will not be tolerated.
