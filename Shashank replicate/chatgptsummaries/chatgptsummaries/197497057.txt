The National Green Tribunal in India recently issued a court order in a case involving two inhabitants of Jalandhar, Punjab, who challenged an order passed by the Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The order pertained to the operation of a brick kiln by Baldev Raj, who was found to be in violation of pollution control regulations. The Pollution Control Board (PPCB) issued a show cause notice to Baldev Raj and directed the closure of the brick kiln. Baldev Raj appealed the decision, and the Appellate Authority allowed the appeal. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the PPCB's decision to close the brick kiln.

The court order discussed the case of a brick kiln operator who was found to be violating pollution control standards. The PPCB issued show cause notices and conducted inspections, but the operator was uncooperative. The Appellate Authority later questioned the sampling procedure and did not give sufficient reasons to disbelieve the PPCB's findings. The court found the Appellate Authority's order to be improper and illegal. Additionally, the court noted that the Appellate Authority should consist of either a single member or three members appointed by the state government, but not two members.

The court order stated that the decision of a single member or three members can be taken by the appointed members of the State Government. If a decision is taken by a single member, it becomes the final decision. However, if it is taken by a three-member authority, any disagreement can be mitigated by the opinion of the other two members. The order also stated that if only two members are appointed and there is a divergence of opinion, there is no third member to overcome the difficulty. Therefore, the impugned order is liable to be quashed. The appeal is allowed, and the common order passed by the Appellate Authority is set aside. The orders passed by the PPCB are restored and become operative. No order is given as to costs.

In summary, the court order dealt with a case involving a brick kiln operator who was found to be violating pollution control standards. The PPCB issued show cause notices and directed the closure of the brick kiln, but the operator appealed the decision and the Appellate Authority allowed the appeal. The court ultimately upheld the PPCB's decision to close the brick kiln and found the Appellate Authority's order to be improper and illegal. Additionally, the court clarified the composition of the Appellate Authority and the decision-making process. The orders passed by the PPCB were restored and became operative.
