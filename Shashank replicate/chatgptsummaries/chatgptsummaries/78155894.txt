The trial court had dismissed the application filed on behalf of the petitioner with the observation that as per the reply of C.B.I., the aforesaid document is not in possession of C.B.I.

The documents were allegedly in possession of the respondent, and the respondent had failed to produce them before the trial court. The petitioner argued that the trial court had erred in dismissing the application filed on behalf of the petitioner without considering the relevance and importance of the documents sought to be requisitioned.

Barar, the then Inspector of C.B.I. before the trial Court within a week from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
