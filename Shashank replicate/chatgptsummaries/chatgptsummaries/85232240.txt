In a recent court order, two individuals who were charged with issuing fake and fabricated emission test certificates without conducting the emission test as per the norms prescribed by the RTO and cheating the public and the government were acquitted of all charges. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove the alleged offences beyond reasonable doubt.

The chargesheet filed against the accused stated that they had issued fake and fabricated emission test certificates without conducting the emission test as per the norms prescribed by the RTO. The accused were also charged with cheating the public and the government by issuing these certificates.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence to support their case. However, the court found that the evidence presented was not sufficient to prove the alleged offences beyond reasonable doubt. The court also noted that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, which further weakened their argument.

As a result, the court acquitted the accused of all charges. The bail bonds of the accused were cancelled and they were set at liberty.

This court order highlights the importance of presenting strong evidence in order to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt. In this case, the prosecution was unable to do so, resulting in the acquittal of the accused.

It is also a reminder that individuals should always follow the prescribed norms and regulations when conducting any kind of testing or certification. Issuing fake certificates not only cheats the public and the government, but also puts people's safety at risk.

Overall, this court order serves as a cautionary tale for those who may be tempted to engage in fraudulent activities. The consequences of such actions can be severe, and it is important to always act with integrity and honesty.
