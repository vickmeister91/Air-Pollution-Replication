The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M.A. Alexander against the Superintendent of Police, Sub Inspector of Police, Pollution Control Board, and Kadapra Panchayat. The petitioner sought a direction to close down an illegal brick kiln operated by the fifth respondent, which was causing severe pollution in the locality.

The Pollution Control Board had granted consent to the fifth respondent to operate the unit subject to certain conditions. However, the environmental engineer's report stated that even after providing control measures, complaints persisted against air and noise pollution. The report suggested that shifting the unit to a less populated area was the only permanent solution.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the Panchayat to consider whether the fifth respondent was functioning lawfully and take effective steps to stop the unit if it was found to be operating without a license. The court also allowed the Pollution Control Board to take effective and prompt steps to end the pollution caused by the unit.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the fifth respondent was operating an illegal brick kiln that was causing severe pollution in the locality. The Pollution Control Board had granted consent to the fifth respondent to operate the unit subject to certain conditions, but the environmental engineer's report stated that even after providing control measures, complaints persisted against air and noise pollution.
