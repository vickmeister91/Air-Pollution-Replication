The court found that the petitioner was a licensee with a valid license to operate the unit and that the closure notice was similar to those issued in other writ petitions. The court followed the decision of a Division Bench in a similar case and quashed the closure notice.

The court allowed the petitioner to operate the unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.
