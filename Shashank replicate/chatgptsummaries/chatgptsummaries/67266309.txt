The Jammu and Kashmir State Pollution Control Board has been in the news recently for issuing orders to brick kiln owners in the state to obtain proper consent under pollution control laws. The board has been cracking down on brick kilns that are operating without proper permissions, and has been issuing orders to shut them down. However, some brick kiln owners have challenged these orders in court, and the latest court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s Khurshid Brick Kiln and others.

The petitioners had challenged the orders issued by the J&K State Pollution Control Board for operating their brick kilns without proper consent under pollution control laws. The court had earlier stayed the operation of the impugned orders and directed the petitioners to produce permissions obtained for running the brick kilns. However, as the petitioners failed to appear in court, the judge issued a court notice to their counsel and listed the matter for further hearing on 27th November 2018.

The issue of pollution caused by brick kilns is a serious one, and the J&K State Pollution Control Board has been taking steps to address it. The board has been conducting inspections of brick kilns in the state, and has been issuing orders to shut down those that are operating without proper permissions. The board has also been working with brick kiln owners to help them obtain the necessary permissions and to adopt cleaner technologies.

However, the issue of pollution caused by brick kilns is not limited to Jammu and Kashmir. Brick kilns are a major source of air pollution in many parts of India, and the government has been taking steps to address this issue. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has issued guidelines for brick kilns to adopt cleaner technologies, and has also launched a scheme to provide financial assistance to brick kiln owners to help them adopt these technologies.

The issue of pollution caused by brick kilns is a complex one, and requires a multi-pronged approach to address it. The government needs to work with brick kiln owners to help them adopt cleaner technologies, and also needs to enforce pollution control laws more effectively. At the same time, the public also needs to be made aware of the issue, and needs to be encouraged to take steps to reduce their own contribution to air pollution.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by M/s Khurshid Brick Kiln and others challenging orders issued by the J&K State Pollution Control Board for operating their brick kilns without proper consent under pollution control laws is an important one. The issue of pollution caused by brick kilns is a serious one, and requires a concerted effort by all stakeholders to address it. The government, brick kiln owners, and the public all have a role to play in reducing air pollution caused by brick kilns, and it is only through a collaborative effort that this issue can be effectively addressed.
