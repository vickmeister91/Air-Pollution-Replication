The Telangana High Court recently heard a writ petition from K. Venkateshwara Rao and others, who were employees of SIEMENS Ltd. and were not continued beyond the age of 58 years. The petitioners claimed that the company was not adopting a uniform policy for the age of superannuation, and that their retirement at 58 years was arbitrary and discriminatory. The court entertained doubt on the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, as the relationship between the petitioners and the company was purely contractual.

The court held that writ remedy is available to an aggrieved person alleging that his rights are affected by an order/decision or not deciding in a given time frame by an authority vested with responsibility to discharge public functions and thereby, offending his right. However, such remedy is not available to a person seeking enforcement of terms of contract vis-Ã -vis private employer. The court dismissed the writ petition as there was no public law element involved in the case and no statutory prescription to continue the petitioners till they attain the age of 60 years.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a writ petition seeking enforcement of terms of employment against a private company is maintainable. The court cites various Supreme Court decisions and concludes that a private company carrying on a commercial activity, such as banking, cannot be termed as an institution or a company carrying on any statutory or public duty. A private body or person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may become necessary to compel such body or association to enforce any statutory obligations or such obligations of public nature casting positive obligation upon it. 

The court also notes that even if a body performing public duty is amenable to writ jurisdiction, only those decisions which have a public element therein can be judicially reviewed under writ jurisdiction. The court order states that only decisions with a public element can be reviewed by the court, and that private decisions cannot be subject to judicial review. The case in question involves a private company and its employees, and the court determines that the company is not discharging any public duty and therefore the writ petition seeking enforcement of service conditions is not maintainable. The court dismisses the petition.

In summary, the Telangana High Court has held that writ remedy is available only to an aggrieved person alleging that his rights are affected by an order/decision or not deciding in a given time frame by an authority vested with responsibility to discharge public functions and thereby, offending his right. The court has also held that private decisions cannot be subject to judicial review, and that only those decisions with a public element can be reviewed by the court. The court has dismissed a writ petition seeking enforcement of service conditions against a private company, as the company was not discharging any public duty and therefore the writ petition was not maintainable.
