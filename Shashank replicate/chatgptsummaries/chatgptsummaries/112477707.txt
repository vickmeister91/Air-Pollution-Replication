The National Green Tribunal in India issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by the Narmada Khand Swabhiman Sena. The petition claimed that mining leases and prospective licenses for bauxite mineral in the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve would cause irreparable damage to the ecology and pollute the river Narmada. The court transferred the case to the Central Zone Bench of the National Green Tribunal and issued a stay on the granting of licenses. The case was amended to include additional respondents and challenged the granting of licenses to M/s Ganpati Minerals and Imtiaz Khan. The state government argued that they had the authority to grant licenses under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The court order discusses a case regarding the granting of a mining license for bauxite mining in a village in Madhya Pradesh. The respondents argue that the proposed mining area falls within the buffer zone where mining activities are permissible and that the state government has recommended the case for granting a license. The court orders the Ministry of Environment and Forests to inspect the area and determine whether the land falls within the core or buffer zone of the Amarkantak biosphere reserve and whether mining activities can be permitted on such land.

The court order pertains to the granting of mining licenses in the Buffer Zone of the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) in Madhya Pradesh. The court has ordered the suspension of the licenses until a Landscape Plan for the AABR is prepared by the concerned State Government. The Respondents argue that their mining activities will not harm the flora and fauna in the area and that they have obtained necessary clearances and consents. The court has asked for detailed reports and affidavits from various officials and committees involved in the matter.

The court order discusses the legality of granting mining leases in the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) in Madhya Pradesh, India. The court notes that there is no specific law prohibiting mining activities in the buffer and transition zones of the reserve, but such activities must be in line with the purpose of the reserve and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court identifies several points that need to be examined, including the legal backing for objections to granting mining leases, the authority of the central and state governments to restrict activities in the reserve, and the potential impact of mining on biodiversity and local communities. The court also cites a letter from the Ministry of Environment and Forests outlining the establishment of the AABR and its core, buffer, and transition zones.

The court order pertains to the designation of Biosphere Reserves (BR) by UNESCO for representative parts of natural and cultural landscapes. The order discusses the zonation of the proposed Achanakmar-Amarkantak BR and the roles of the Core, Buffer, and Transition zones. The court examines whether the Central or State Government has the authority to restrict or prohibit activities in the BR and refers to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2007. The order also notes that some issues raised in the application involve substantial questions of law of general importance for taking policy decisions in this and similar matters.

The court order discusses the Indian National Man and Biosphere (MAB) Committee, which identifies and recommends potential sites for designation as Biosphere Reserves, following UNESCO's guidelines and criteria. Biosphere Reserves are designated to reconcile the conservation of biodiversity, economic and social development, and maintenance of associated cultural values. The order outlines the characteristics and functions of Biosphere Reserves, as well as the beneficiaries and legal framework. The Biosphere Reserve program is not intended to replace existing protected areas but rather to widen the scope of conventional protection and strengthen the Protected Area Network.

The court order discusses the establishment and management of Biosphere Reserves (BR) in India. It emphasizes the importance of conservation of overall biodiversity and landscape, involvement of local communities, and sustainable development. The Central Government is responsible for overall coordination and financial assistance, while the State Governments/UT Administration and other stakeholders are responsible for local management. The order also outlines the components of Management Action Plans for Conservation and Development, including value addition activities, setting up of pilot plots, rehabilitation of landscapes, socio-economic upliftment of local communities, and development of eco-tourism. The order stresses the importance of managing natural resources efficiently while ensuring ecological diversity and sustainable productivity.

The court order states that natural resources can be utilized in the Buffer and Transition zones as long as they do not harm ecological diversity and are characteristic of the region. The emphasis should be on rehabilitating the area and restoring ecology sustainably while involving local communities. The order also discusses the need for a Landscape Plan and the role of committees in managing the Biosphere Reserve. The order notes that sustainable mining activity in Buffer/Transition zones is possible if ecological integrity is maintained, biodiversity is sustained, and a foolproof EIA study is done. The court also cites a study on the adverse effects of opencast Bauxite mining in the Amarkantak region.

The court order discusses the impact of bauxite mining on the environment and the need for careful environmental management programs in mining areas. The court recognizes the importance of Biosphere Reserves for environmental stability and biodiversity monitoring, but also acknowledges the potential for mining to contribute to sustainable development when managed effectively.
