The court order in question is related to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by villagers of Samagoga and Baraya, alleging pollution caused by certain industries. The petitioners had claimed that the industries were emitting hazardous waste and gases beyond permissible limits, causing harm to the environment and the health of the local population.

In response to the PIL, the court directed the Pollution Control Board (PCB) to investigate the matter and submit a report. The PCB conducted an inspection of the industries in question and found that none of them were emitting hazardous waste or gases beyond permissible limits. The report submitted by the PCB was taken into consideration by the court.

The court then directed the Panchayats to collect assessed taxes from the industries. The Panchayats were also directed to allow the industries to appeal if they were dissatisfied with the assessment. This was done to ensure that the industries were paying their fair share of taxes and to provide them with a mechanism to challenge any unfair assessments.

Finally, the court disposed of the petition with no order as to costs. This means that the petitioners were not required to pay any costs associated with the litigation. The court's decision was based on the fact that the industries were found to be operating within permissible limits and that there was no evidence of any harm being caused to the environment or the health of the local population.

Overall, the court order in question highlights the importance of balancing the interests of industry and the environment. While it is important to ensure that industries are operating within permissible limits and paying their fair share of taxes, it is equally important to protect the environment and the health of the local population. The court's decision in this case reflects a careful consideration of these competing interests and a commitment to ensuring that justice is served.
