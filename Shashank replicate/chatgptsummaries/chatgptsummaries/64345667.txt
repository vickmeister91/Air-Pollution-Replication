In the first court order, SDM Vivek Vihar had filed a case against Surjeet Singh Virdhi for illegally installing a groundwater bore well. The accused was charged under sections 15 and 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. However, on 14 July 2015, the accused was acquitted of all charges. The court considered the testimony of witnesses, photographs, and other documents presented by both parties before making the decision.

The defense counsel argued that there were contradictions in the testimony of the complainant's witnesses and that no public person was present during the raid. The prosecution argued that the accused had installed a new groundwater bore well without permission from the competent authority. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of all charges.

In the second court order, the accused was charged with installing a bore-well without permission from the competent authority. The court found contradictions in the depositions of the complainant's witnesses and concluded that the complainant had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was acquitted of all charges, but was directed to furnish fresh bail bonds. The case property, if any, was to be confiscated to the state, and the file was to be consigned to the record room.

The third court order was related to the same case as the first court order. It was announced in open court on 14 July 2015 and was 11 pages long. The court order included a spare copy.

In both court orders, the accused was charged with violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 by installing a bore-well without permission from the competent authority. However, in both cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of all charges.

The defense counsel in both cases argued that there were contradictions in the testimony of the complainant's witnesses and that no public person was present during the raid. These arguments seem to have been successful in convincing the court that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

It is important to note that the court orders do not provide any information about the environmental impact of the accused's actions. The focus of the court orders was solely on whether or not the accused had violated the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It is possible that the accused's actions had a negative impact on the environment, but this was not addressed in the court orders.

In conclusion, the court orders pertain to a case where the accused was charged with violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 by installing a bore-well without permission from the competent authority. In both cases, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of all charges. The court orders do not provide any information about the environmental impact of the accused's actions.
