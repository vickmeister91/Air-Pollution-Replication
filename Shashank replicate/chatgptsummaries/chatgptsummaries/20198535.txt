The State of Rajasthan filed a series of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and another party regarding the alteration of the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries, with the State arguing that the issue was covered by a previous judgment and the respondents arguing that the Collector did have the power.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court ruled in favor of the State, stating that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries. The court ordered the impugned orders to be set aside and remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant laws and previous judgments. The court noted that the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provided for the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and that the boundaries of such sanctuaries could only be altered by the state government. The court also referred to a previous judgment in which it was held that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries of a wildlife sanctuary.

The court rejected the respondents' argument that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956. The court noted that the Land Revenue Act did not provide for the alteration of the boundaries of a wildlife sanctuary and that the Wildlife Protection Act was a special law that would prevail over the Land Revenue Act.

The court's decision has important implications for the protection of wildlife sanctuaries in Rajasthan. By affirming that the state government has the exclusive power to alter the boundaries of such sanctuaries, the court has ensured that these areas will be protected from arbitrary alterations that could harm the wildlife and their habitats.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following established legal procedures when making decisions that affect the environment. The court noted that the Collector had not followed the proper procedures when altering the boundaries of the sanctuary and that this had led to the filing of the petitions by the State.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the protection of wildlife and the environment in Rajasthan. By upholding the exclusive power of the state government to alter the boundaries of wildlife sanctuaries, the court has ensured that these areas will be protected for future generations.
