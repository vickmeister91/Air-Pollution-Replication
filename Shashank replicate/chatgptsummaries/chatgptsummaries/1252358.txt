The case in question involves a petitioner named Preston Silva who sought anticipatory bail in connection with a forest crime case. The Public Prosecutor opposed the application, stating that the petitioner had purchased tusks of an elephant that had been removed from a reserve forest by accused persons. The court denied anticipatory bail and directed the petitioner to surrender before the magistrate and apply for regular bail within two weeks. The court also stated that the bail application would be considered and disposed of on the same day it is filed.

The petitioner's request for anticipatory bail was met with opposition from the Public Prosecutor, who argued that the petitioner had purchased tusks of an elephant that had been removed from a reserve forest by accused persons. This argument was likely made in an effort to demonstrate that the petitioner was complicit in the forest crime case and therefore not deserving of anticipatory bail.

Despite the opposition from the Public Prosecutor, the court ultimately denied the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail. Instead, the court directed the petitioner to surrender before the magistrate and apply for regular bail within two weeks. This decision suggests that the court did not believe that the petitioner was entitled to anticipatory bail given the circumstances of the case.

Furthermore, the court made it clear that the bail application would be considered and disposed of on the same day it is filed. This is an important detail as it indicates that the court is taking the case seriously and is committed to ensuring that justice is served in a timely manner.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following due process in cases involving forest crimes. The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail and require the petitioner to surrender before the magistrate and apply for regular bail within two weeks demonstrates a commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that those who are complicit in forest crimes are held accountable for their actions.
