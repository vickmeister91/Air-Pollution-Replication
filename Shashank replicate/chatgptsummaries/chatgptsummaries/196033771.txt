The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order in a criminal revision petition filed by Sizzling Crafts Pvt Ltd against an order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate in Delhi. The case involves a complaint filed by Kamlesh Garg under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the petitioners. The complainant alleged that the petitioner No.2, who is a director of petitioner No.1, approached her for a loan of Rs. 2 lakhs, which was given by way of a cheque. The cheques issued by petitioner No.1 were dishonoured, and the complainant filed a complaint.

The petitioners argued that all the directors of the company should have been made parties to the case. However, the court held that only the person who was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence would be held responsible. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the trial court record to be sent back.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the liability of directors in cases of cheque bouncing. The court held that only the person who was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence would be held responsible. This means that if a director is not actively involved in the day-to-day affairs of the company, they cannot be held liable for the offence of cheque bouncing.

The court order also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The Act provides for strict liability in cases of cheque bouncing, and it is essential for companies to ensure that they have sufficient funds in their accounts to honour cheques issued by them. Failure to do so can result in criminal liability for the company and its directors.

In this case, the court held that the petitioners were liable for the offence of cheque bouncing, as the cheques issued by petitioner No.1 were dishonoured. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the trial court record to be sent back. This means that the trial court will now proceed with the case and the petitioners will have to face trial for the offence of cheque bouncing.

The court order also highlights the importance of proper legal representation in such cases. The petitioners had argued that all the directors of the company should have been made parties to the case. However, the court held that only the person who was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence would be held responsible. This shows that it is essential for companies to have competent legal representation to ensure that their interests are protected in such cases.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the Delhi High Court in the criminal revision petition filed by Sizzling Crafts Pvt Ltd clarifies the liability of directors in cases of cheque bouncing. The court held that only the person who was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offence would be held responsible. The court order also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act and proper legal representation in such cases. The order serves as a reminder to companies to ensure that they have sufficient funds in their accounts to honour cheques issued by them and to take necessary legal precautions to protect their interests.
