In a recent criminal revision case, the applicant challenged the dismissal of their application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The applicant had requested copies of statements made by various witnesses during the merg enquiry, which were not annexed to the charge sheet. The court accepted the revision and directed the prosecution to provide the merg enquiry statements of various witnesses within a week for a fair trial.

The case in question pertains to a criminal matter where the applicant had been charged with an offence. During the course of the investigation, a merg enquiry was conducted, and statements of various witnesses were recorded. However, these statements were not annexed to the charge sheet filed by the prosecution. The applicant, therefore, filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. seeking copies of these statements.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to a person to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The applicant in this case had relied on this provision to seek copies of the statements made by the witnesses during the merg enquiry.

However, the application filed by the applicant was dismissed by the court, which held that the statements were not necessary for the purposes of the trial. The applicant then filed a criminal revision application challenging the dismissal of their application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, accepted the revision and directed the prosecution to provide the merg enquiry statements of various witnesses within a week. The court held that the statements were necessary for a fair trial and that the prosecution was duty-bound to provide the same to the accused.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of fair trial, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to every accused person under the Constitution of India. The court's direction to the prosecution to provide the merg enquiry statements of various witnesses within a week ensures that the accused has access to all relevant documents and evidence that may be used against them during the trial.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and ensuring that all relevant documents and evidence are provided to the accused during the trial. Failure to do so may result in a violation of the accused's right to a fair trial and may lead to the quashing of the trial or conviction.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this criminal revision case is a welcome step towards ensuring that the principles of natural justice and fair trial are upheld in criminal proceedings. The court's direction to the prosecution to provide the merg enquiry statements of various witnesses within a week ensures that the accused has access to all relevant documents and evidence that may be used against them during the trial. The decision also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and ensuring that all relevant documents and evidence are provided to the accused during the trial.
