In 1996, the Delhi High Court passed a series of orders pertaining to the relocation of hazardous and noxious industries from Delhi due to extensive pollution. The court monitored the matter and passed an order stating that the land vacated by the relocated industries can only be used to make up the deficiency as per the needs of the community, based on the norms given in the Master Plan. The court directed that the land surrendered by the owners/occupiers of the relocated industries should be used for the development of green belts and open spaces. The order also specified the extent and percentage of land to be surrendered and dedicated to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for development and the owner for their own benefit.

The court order emphasized that the industries had an obligation to shift and relocate in accordance with the Master Plan and that the Court had given them ample opportunities before passing the order. The order also clarified the permissible Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for different plot sizes and rejected the contention that compensation should be paid for the surrendered land. The surrendered land was to be used for green belts and open spaces, while the land left with the owner was to be developed in accordance with the user permitted under the Master Plan.

The court order also stated that even industries that closed prior to the order were liable to surrender land. The surrendered land was to be used for green belts and open spaces. The landowners were entitled to an additional 50% FAR in regard to the land permitted to be retained by them for their benefit, but no other compensation for the surrendered land. The order was passed in public interest and to get effect to the Master Plan. The court rejected the petitioners' contentions that their lands should be acquired and that they were entitled to compensation.

In another court order, the court stated that additional FAR (floor area ratio) will be given in place of monetary compensation for land surrendered and dedicated to DDA for community use, green belts, and lung spaces. The surrendered land will vest in trust in DDA for the benefit of the community, and the additional FAR will be the only compensation for such surrender. The surrendered land cannot be used for any purpose other than as green belt or other spaces for the benefit of the community. The DDA shall maintain a Trust Account of such surrendered lands. The landowner-dedicator will have the benefit of compensation on account of land ceasing to be 'land dedicated to the community purpose of lung/open space.' The court also clarifies that any change in use of such surrendered land held in trust by DDA or any transfer by DDA shall be only after securing prior permission from the High Court of Delhi.

Overall, the court orders aim to address the issue of pollution in Delhi by relocating hazardous and noxious industries and using the surrendered land for the development of green belts and open spaces. The court has emphasized the importance of following the Master Plan and has rejected the contention that compensation should be paid for the surrendered land. Instead, the court has provided additional FAR as compensation for the land surrendered for community use. The court has also established a Trust Account to ensure that the surrendered land is used only for the benefit of the community and that any change in use or transfer of the land requires prior permission from the High Court of Delhi.
