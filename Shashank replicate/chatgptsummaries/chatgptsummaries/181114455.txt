The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Zarina Khan against an order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate in connection with a criminal complaint case. The complaint was initially filed by Jarina Khan against three individuals for various offences, but was later withdrawn voluntarily. The revisionist filed an application seeking correction of a clerical error in the order dated 11.05.2011, which was dismissed by the Magistrate. The revisionist then filed another application seeking initiation of an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against two individuals, which was entertained by the Magistrate. The court found no fault with the Magistrate's order dismissing the first application, but did not comment on the second application.

The court order states that an application was made to the Magistrate, who directed notice to be issued to an advocate. The matter was listed for further proceedings on a later date. The Magistrate decided to embark upon an inquiry into the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. and adjourned the matter for further proceedings. The court did not make any further comments as the inquiry is yet to be conducted. The trial court record along with a copy of the judgment is to be sent back, and the file of the revision petition is to be consigned to the Record Room.

To provide further context, Section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the procedure for cases in which false evidence has been given or forged documents have been produced in court. The section allows for the court to initiate an inquiry into such cases and take appropriate action against the individuals involved. In this case, the revisionist had filed an application seeking initiation of an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against two individuals.

The court order does not provide any details about the nature of the offences alleged in the original complaint filed by Jarina Khan, or the individuals against whom the complaint was filed. It is also unclear why the complaint was withdrawn voluntarily. However, it appears that the revisionist, Zarina Khan, was seeking to correct a clerical error in the Magistrate's order and also initiate an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against two individuals.

The court found no fault with the Magistrate's order dismissing the first application seeking correction of a clerical error. It is not clear what the nature of the clerical error was, but it appears that the court did not find it to be a significant issue. The court did not comment on the second application seeking initiation of an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against two individuals, as the inquiry is yet to be conducted.

The court order states that the trial court record along with a copy of the judgment is to be sent back, and the file of the revision petition is to be consigned to the Record Room. This suggests that the matter has been concluded and there will be no further proceedings in this case.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Zarina Khan against an order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate in connection with a criminal complaint case. The court found no fault with the Magistrate's order dismissing the first application seeking correction of a clerical error, but did not comment on the second application seeking initiation of an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against two individuals. The matter has been concluded and the trial court record along with a copy of the judgment is to be sent back, and the file of the revision petition is to be consigned to the Record Room.
