The court order in question is related to a writ petition filed by Mujeeb Rahman C against the Geologist and other respondents, alleging illegal conduct of a granite quarry by the 5th respondent. The petitioner sought a direction to stop the alleged illegal quarrying operation and a declaration that the 5th respondent is not legally entitled to do mining operation without obtaining environmental clearance.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court disposed of the petition with a direction to the Pollution Control Board to inspect the quarrying operations carried out by the 5th respondent and ascertain whether they are in accordance with the terms of consent granted for the said operations. If there is any breach, the Pollution Control Board shall issue a notice asking the 5th respondent to take remedial measures to comply with the conditions stipulated by the Board.

The court's decision is based on the principle of sustainable development, which requires that economic development should not be at the cost of the environment. The court has recognized the importance of environmental protection and has directed the Pollution Control Board to ensure that the quarrying operations are carried out in a manner that is consistent with the principles of sustainable development.

The court's decision is also in line with the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, which requires that any person carrying out an industrial activity that is likely to cause environmental pollution must obtain prior environmental clearance from the relevant authorities. The court has recognized that the 5th respondent has not obtained the necessary environmental clearance and has directed the Pollution Control Board to take appropriate action in this regard.

The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development. It also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations to ensure that industrial activities do not cause harm to the environment.

The court's decision also provides a mechanism for addressing grievances related to environmental pollution caused by industrial activities. The petitioner has been given the right to approach the relevant statutory authorities to ventilate any grievance he may have on account of the quarrying operations carried out by the 5th respondent.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a step towards ensuring that economic development is carried out in a sustainable manner that does not harm the environment. It highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and provides a mechanism for addressing grievances related to environmental pollution caused by industrial activities.
