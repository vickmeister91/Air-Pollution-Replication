The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Matri Sadan, a voluntary social organization, against the State of Jharkhand and another party. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed in a previous case, arguing that the complaint filed by a private complainant could not be maintained under Rule 11(b) of the Environment Protection Rule.

The case in question involved allegations of illegal mining and transportation of sand and stones from the riverbed of the Ganga in the state of Jharkhand. The petitioner, Matri Sadan, had been actively involved in protesting against such activities and had filed several complaints with the authorities.

In the previous case, a private complainant had filed a complaint against the petitioner, alleging that they had obstructed the mining and transportation activities. The court had taken cognizance of the offense and had initiated criminal proceedings against the petitioner.

However, the petitioner argued that the complaint filed by the private complainant was not maintainable under Rule 11(b) of the Environment Protection Rule. This rule states that any complaint relating to an offense under the rule must be filed by an officer authorized by the state government or the central government.

The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and quashed the order taking cognizance of the offense against them. The court held that the private complainant did not have the authority to file such a complaint and that the complaint was therefore not maintainable.

The court also noted that the entire criminal proceeding was based on the complaint filed by the private complainant and that the complaint being not maintainable, the entire proceeding was also not maintainable. Therefore, the court quashed the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioner.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following the due process of law. The court held that any complaint relating to an offense under the Environment Protection Rule must be filed by an authorized officer and that private individuals cannot file such complaints.

This decision is also significant in the context of environmental protection. The court's decision reinforces the need to protect the environment and to take action against those who violate environmental laws. The court's decision sends a strong message that environmental laws must be enforced and that those who violate them will be held accountable.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a significant step towards ensuring that environmental laws are enforced and that those who violate them are held accountable. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of following due process of law and sends a strong message that environmental laws must be taken seriously.
