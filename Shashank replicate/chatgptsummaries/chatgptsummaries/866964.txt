The court order discussed multiple cases filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The cases involved petitioners and opposite parties, including the State of Orissa and its representatives. The names of the lawyers representing each party were also mentioned. However, no further details about the cases or their outcomes were provided.

The text described four court cases with multiple parties involved in each case. The names of the parties and their respective lawyers were listed, but no information was provided about the details or outcomes of the cases.

The court order pertained to two petitions filed by landowners whose land was acquired by the State Government in Orissa. The petitioners were represented by different lawyers, while the opposition parties were represented by the Advocate General and other senior advocates. The court order was delivered by the Chief Justice and another judge on November 16, 2010.

The court order also pertained to petitions filed by landowners whose land was acquired by the State Government for the establishment of a university by the Anil Agarwal Foundation. The petitions were filed on behalf of the landowners and the public whose interests were affected by the acquisition of land. The court heard the petitions together and summarized the necessary facts. The petitioners alleged that the Foundation was not a public company and had obtained land illegally. The court ordered further investigation into the matter.

In another case, the court order pertained to the acquisition of land for the Vedanta University in Orissa. The petitioners argued that the university would have complete autonomy in matters of administration, admission, fee structure, curriculum, and faculty, which is not permissible. They also contended that the land requirement is excessive and that the real purpose of acquiring such vast tracts of land is masked. The petitioners further argued that the Vedanta Foundation, which is a private company, cannot acquire land for educational purposes, which is a public purpose. The court also noted that the Foundation's conversion to a public company is not legally permissible, and the acquisition of land for the university is a fraud played upon the State Government. The court ordered the quashing of the acquisition notifications and consequential actions taken by the State Government and its offices.

The court order discussed counter affidavits filed by the State Government and beneficiary companies in response to writ petitions challenging the acquisition of land for the establishment of Vedanta University. The affidavits stated that the acquisition process was carried out in compliance with the Land Acquisition Act and that objections were not filed during the statutory period. The affidavits also denied allegations of collusion, fraud, and adverse effects on the environment. The court was asked to dismiss the writ petitions.

In another case related to the acquisition of land by the State Government for the establishment of Vedanta University, the court considered various points, including whether the beneficiary company is a public company, whether the acquisition of land is legal, whether the landowners have waived their rights, and whether the acquisition violates environmental laws. The court also considered whether the public interest petitions are maintainable and what reliefs the petitioners are entitled to.

The court order discussed the legal definitions of private and public companies under the Companies Act, as well as the requirements for minimum paid-up capital and number of shareholders. The case in question involved the Vedanta Foundation, which was originally registered as a private limited company but later changed its name and status to a public company. However, the Assistant Registrar of Companies has stated that the Foundation did not comply with the necessary provisions to become a public company, and therefore it is not legally considered a public company. The court ultimately ruled against the Foundation on this point.

The court order stated that the Anil Agarwal Foundation cannot be deemed a public or government company until it complies with certain provisions of the Companies Act and has the required number of members. The Foundation is a private company limited by guarantee. The court also cited a Supreme Court decision that distinguishes between private and public companies, and concluded that the Foundation cannot be considered a public limited company for the purpose of land acquisition. The court ruled in favor of the petitioners on both points.

The court order stated that the acquisition of lands is only permissible for certain purposes, such as the erection of dwelling houses for workmen or for the provision of amenities directly connected to a company's industry or work for public purposes. The court found that the proposed acquisition of lands for the establishment of a non-existent university by a private company is illegal and impermissible under the law. The court also found that the State Government did not follow the due procedure as required under the Land Acquisition Act and Rules, and therefore, the acquisition proceedings in favor of the beneficiary company are bad in law and liable to be quashed.

In another case where land was acquired by the State Government for the establishment of a university by a foundation, the petitioners alleged that the foundation misrepresented itself as a public limited company and played fraud on the government to acquire the land. The court examined the legal contentions of both parties and held that the State Government did not follow the mandatory procedure for acquisition of land for a public purpose. The court ruled against the State Government and the beneficiary company and held that the acquisition of land is void ab-initio in law.

The court order stated that the acquisition of land may cause harm if the government withdraws from the acquisition. The court cited previous cases to argue that strict compliance with the Land Acquisition Act and Rules is necessary, especially when acquiring land for a private company. The
