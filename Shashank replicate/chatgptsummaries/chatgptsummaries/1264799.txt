The court order in question pertains to a petition challenging an order passed by the Competent Authority under Section 39(1)(d) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The order had confiscated and declared the petitioner's tractor and trolley as property of the government. The petitioner argued that the vehicle can only be confiscated if it is proved to have been used for committing an offence, and since the petitioner and driver had been acquitted of the offence, the order was unsustainable. The court agreed with the petitioner and quashed the order, directing the respondents to return the vehicle to the petitioner.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Section 39(1)(d) of the Act empowers the Competent Authority to confiscate any vehicle, vessel or animal that has been used for committing an offence under the Act. The section also provides for the declaration of such property as property of the government.

In the present case, the petitioner's tractor and trolley were confiscated and declared as property of the government by the Competent Authority under Section 39(1)(d) of the Act. The petitioner had been charged with transporting sand illegally from a riverbed, which is a violation of the Act. However, the petitioner and the driver of the vehicle were acquitted of the offence by the trial court.

The petitioner argued that since they had been acquitted of the offence, the order of confiscation and declaration of the vehicle as property of the government was unsustainable. The petitioner contended that the vehicle can only be confiscated if it is proved to have been used for committing an offence. Since they had been acquitted of the offence, there was no evidence to suggest that the vehicle had been used for committing the offence.

The court agreed with the petitioner and quashed the order of confiscation and declaration of the vehicle as property of the government. The court held that the Competent Authority can only confiscate a vehicle if it is proved to have been used for committing an offence under the Act. Since the petitioner and the driver had been acquitted of the offence, there was no evidence to suggest that the vehicle had been used for committing the offence. Therefore, the order of confiscation and declaration of the vehicle as property of the government was unsustainable.

The court directed the respondents to return the vehicle to the petitioner. The court also observed that the Competent Authority had not followed the due process of law while passing the order of confiscation and declaration of the vehicle as property of the government. The court noted that the Competent Authority had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The court held that the principles of natural justice require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against him.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition challenging an order passed by the Competent Authority under Section 39(1)(d) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
