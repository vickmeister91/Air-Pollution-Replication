The court order pertains to a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation challenging an order passed by the State of Gujarat assigning the possession of lease and extending the lease period in terms of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Act of 2015 in favor of respondent No.5. The petitioners seek to restrain respondent No.5 from constructing any road from the Gauchar land bearing Survey No.335/1 of village Dedhrota for mining purpose. The case involves the interpretation of the Constitution of India or any order made thereunder.

The mining lease for bauxite was granted to respondent No.5 for a period of 20 years in the village of Dedhrota. The lease expired in 2006 and was not renewed until 2015, when it was extended for 50 years. The petitioners argue that this extension violates Supreme Court directions and a government resolution, and that the Environmental Clearance Certificate was not obtained before the extension. They also argue that the amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957, which allowed for the extension, does not apply to this case as the lease period had already expired.

The dispute over the construction of a road on Gauchar land is in violation of a resolution passed by the State Government. The petitioner argues that an alternate road is available for mining activities, and the respondent authorities should be prevented from constructing the road. The respondent argues that the lease extension was legal and that the construction of the road was approved by the Gram Panchayat and the State Government. The court is asked to dismiss the petition.

The court order dismisses the Public Interest Litigation filed by the petitioners, stating that they have made misstatements and suppressed material facts. The court also notes that a similar writ petition was filed earlier and not entertained. The order further discusses the history of mining activities and lease agreements in the area, including a rejected application for renewal of a mining lease and subsequent revision by the Ministry of Mines. The respondent No.5 has made representations to the State for passing an order pursuant to the revisional authority's order.

The mining lease was granted in 1985 for a period of 20 years, but possession of the leased area could not be handed over to the respondent. After the lease expired in 2008, the respondent requested renewal, but the application was rejected by the State Government. The respondent then appealed to the Ministry of Mines, which remanded the matter back to the State Government for reconsideration. Ultimately, the State Government passed an order in 2015 extending the mining lease, which the court found to be legal. The order also discusses the construction of a road and the resolution passed by the Gram Panchayat regarding the road's construction.

The State Government must decide on an application according to the directions given by the Revisional Authority. The petitioners have not challenged previous orders granting a mining lease, and the current order is a result of the Revisional Authority's previous order. The court also notes that a previous petition challenging the same order was dismissed, and therefore the current petitioners cannot challenge the order on the same grounds. The court also mentions that an Environmental Clearance Certificate was not obtained by the respondent No.5 at the time of the previous order.

The Environmental Clearance Certificate was not obtained by respondent No.5, but has now been issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The petitioners cannot challenge the adverse effects on the environment and agricultural lands if the Gauchar land is given to respondent No.5 for mining activities. The Gram Panchayat passed a resolution to construct a road passing through survey Nos. 335/1 and 334 of village Dedhrota, which the respondent authorities have decided to construct. The petitioners have an alternative remedy of filing a revision application before the Ministry of Mines or filing proceedings before the National Green Tribunal. The present petition is dismissed.

In conclusion, the court order discusses a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation challenging an order passed by the State of Gujarat assigning the possession of lease and extending the lease period in terms of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Act of 2015 in favor of respondent No.5. The court dismisses the petition and notes that the lease extension was legal. The court also discusses the history of mining activities and lease agreements in the area, including a rejected application for renewal of a mining lease and subsequent revision by the Ministry of Mines. The court mentions that an Environmental Clearance Certificate was not obtained by the respondent No.5 at the time of the previous order, but has now been issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The petitioners have an alternative remedy of filing a revision application before the Ministry of Mines or filing proceedings before the National Green Tribunal.
