The court has granted bail to three petitioners who were in custody for offences under Sections 9 and 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has allowed the bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. and directed the petitioners to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- each and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act has been amended several times to strengthen its provisions and to address emerging issues related to wildlife conservation.

The three petitioners in this case were charged with offences under Sections 9 and 51 of the Act. Section 9 deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 deals with offences related to trade or commerce in wildlife and their products. These offences are serious in nature and can attract imprisonment for a term of up to seven years and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000/-.

The petitioners had filed a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C., which provides for the grant of bail to a person who is in custody during the pendency of a trial. The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, granted bail to the petitioners on certain conditions.

The court directed the petitioners to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- each and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This means that the petitioners have to provide a guarantee that they will appear before the trial court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. The surety bonds are provided by two persons who guarantee that the petitioners will comply with the conditions of bail.

The court also imposed certain other conditions on the petitioners. They were directed not to leave the jurisdiction of the trial court without prior permission, not to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses, and to cooperate with the investigation and trial. These conditions are standard conditions that are imposed on a person who is granted bail.

The grant of bail to the petitioners is a significant development in this case. It means that the petitioners will be released from custody and will be able to prepare for their defence in the trial. However, it is important to note that the grant of bail does not mean that the charges against the petitioners have been dropped. The trial will continue and the petitioners will have to face the charges against them.
