The court has recently issued two orders pertaining to criminal cases against the petitioners, who are employees and directors of M/s Electro Steel Integrated Limited. The cases were filed on the allegation that the petitioners encroached upon forest land and started constructing a boundary wall without permission from the Central Government. The petitioners have sought to quash the criminal proceedings, citing their right, title, and interest over the land based on registered sale deeds.

In the first order, the court observed that there are genuine disputes over the right, title, and interest over the land, and the criminal proceedings are unwarranted. Therefore, the court quashed the proceedings of all six cases. This means that the petitioners will no longer be prosecuted for the alleged offences.

The second order sets aside the orders under which cognizance of the offences under Section 33(c) of the Indian Forest Act and Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act were taken against the petitioners in Bokaro. The applications stand allowed. This means that the petitioners will not be prosecuted for the alleged offences under these sections.

The court's decision to quash the criminal proceedings against the petitioners is based on the fact that there are genuine disputes over the right, title, and interest over the land. The petitioners have claimed that they have the right to the land based on registered sale deeds. However, the government has alleged that the land is forest land and the petitioners have encroached upon it without permission.

The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the importance of resolving disputes over land ownership before initiating criminal proceedings. The court has also recognized the importance of registered sale deeds as evidence of ownership. This decision will have implications for other cases where there are disputes over land ownership.

The court's decision is also significant because it recognizes the importance of protecting forest land. The Forest Conservation Act is a key piece of legislation that aims to protect forest land from encroachment and destruction. The court's decision to set aside the orders under this Act sends a message that the government must follow due process before taking action against alleged offenders.

Overall, the court's decision in these cases is a positive development for the petitioners and for the protection of land and forests. The court has recognized the importance of resolving disputes over land ownership before initiating criminal proceedings and has set aside orders under the Forest Conservation Act. This decision will have implications for other cases where there are disputes over land ownership and for the protection of forest land.
