The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to cases related to land encroachment and regularization of unauthorized colonies in Delhi. The first order relates to a writ petition filed by a resident of a village in Delhi alleging illegal encroachment of land. The court had earlier directed the removal of encroachments and utilization of the land for forest and trees or public utility. However, subsequent applications were filed seeking an extension of time to carry out the mandate of the order. The court suspended the previous order for six months to decide whether the colony is to be regularized or not. The fifth respondent's colony was later regularized, and the court was urged to dismiss the appeal since there was no challenge to the policy of regularization or the order doing the same. The court also noted the provisions of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second Act, 2011, which requires status quo to be maintained in respect of unauthorized colonies that came into existence in Delhi before 31.3.2002.

The second court order pertains to the regularization of unauthorized colonies, village abadi areas, and urban villages in Delhi. The order mandates that the regularization should be in line with the national policy for urban street vendors and hawkers as provided in the Master Plan for Delhi, 2021. It also provides guidelines for the orderly arrangement of schools, dispensaries, religious institutions, cultural institutions, storages, warehouses, and godowns used for agricultural inputs or produce in rural areas built on agricultural land. The order further states that no action can be taken towards demolition or eviction of lands, and status quo as on 1-1-2006 in respect of encroachment or unauthorized development must be maintained. The State had decided to regularize the colony in question based on relevant factors and regulations relating to the regularization of unauthorized colonies in Delhi. The court cannot grant relief in the absence of any specific challenge to the Act or the Regulations.
