In a recent court order, two applications filed by the plaintiff were dismissed as not maintainable. The applications pertained to the withdrawal of original documents related to a property and their replacement with certified copies, as well as the return of the original documents to facilitate an investigation in a pending case.

The defendant in the case argued that the applications were not maintainable as the investigating officer had already obtained certified copies of the documents. The court considered this argument and ultimately found that the purpose of the applications had been fulfilled, rendering them unnecessary.

The first application filed by the plaintiff sought to withdraw original documents related to a property and replace them with certified copies. The plaintiff argued that the original documents were required for an investigation in a pending case. The defendant, however, argued that the investigating officer had already obtained certified copies of the documents and that the application was therefore not maintainable.

The court considered the arguments put forth by both parties and ultimately found that the purpose of the application had been fulfilled. The investigating officer had already obtained certified copies of the documents, rendering the withdrawal of the original documents unnecessary. As a result, the court dismissed the application as not maintainable.

The second application filed by the plaintiff sought the return of the original documents to facilitate an investigation in a pending case. The plaintiff argued that the investigating officer had not returned the original documents despite having obtained certified copies. The defendant, however, argued that the investigating officer had not been directed to return the original documents and that the application was therefore not maintainable.

The court considered the arguments put forth by both parties and ultimately found that the purpose of the application had been fulfilled. The investigating officer had obtained certified copies of the documents and had not been directed to return the original documents. As a result, the court dismissed the application as not maintainable.

In both cases, the court found that the purpose of the applications had been fulfilled and that they were therefore not maintainable. The defendant's argument that the investigating officer had already obtained certified copies of the documents was a key factor in the court's decision.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of considering whether an application is necessary and maintainable before filing it. In this case, the court found that the purpose of the applications had already been fulfilled, rendering them unnecessary. As a result, the applications were dismissed as not maintainable.
