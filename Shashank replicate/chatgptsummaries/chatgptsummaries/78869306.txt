The State of Odisha filed an application in court to restrain the State of Andhra Pradesh from proceeding with the construction of the Polavaram project on the river Godavari at Polavaram. The State of Odisha requested that the construction should be in accordance with the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980 and the necessary clearances should be in conformity with the relevant laws including Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980 was established to resolve disputes between the States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Odisha over the sharing of Godavari river waters. The award was binding on all the parties involved, and it specified the amount of water that each state was entitled to use.

The State of Odisha argued that the construction of the Polavaram project by the State of Andhra Pradesh would affect the flow of water in the Godavari river, which would have a direct impact on the availability of water for irrigation and other purposes in Odisha. The State of Odisha also argued that the construction of the project would violate the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980 and the relevant environmental laws.

The court disposed of subsequent applications filed by the State of Odisha and requested the Chief Secretaries of the plaintiff and defendants to file an affidavit stating that their respective Governments are bound by Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980. The court also mentioned that the pendency of these proceedings does not preclude the Chief Ministers of the States in arriving at a settlement.

The court's decision was significant because it reaffirmed the importance of the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980 and the need for all parties to abide by its provisions. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of environmental laws and the need to ensure that all construction projects are in compliance with these laws.

The Polavaram project is a multi-purpose irrigation project that is being constructed on the river Godavari in Andhra Pradesh. The project is expected to provide irrigation water to over 7 lakh acres of land in Andhra Pradesh and generate hydroelectric power. The project has been controversial since its inception, with several states raising concerns about its impact on the environment and the availability of water.

The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the future of the Polavaram project and other similar projects in the region. It sends a clear message that all construction projects must be in compliance with environmental laws and the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case filed by the State of Odisha against the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding the construction of the Polavaram project on the river Godavari at Polavaram reaffirmed the importance of the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal Award 1980 and the need for all parties to abide by its provisions. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of environmental laws and the need to ensure that all construction projects are in compliance with these laws. The decision is likely to have a significant impact on the future of the Polavaram project and other similar projects in the region.
