The court order pertains to the grant of mining leases and the requirements for obtaining such leases. The court heard two writ petitions filed against the order of the Revisional Authority of Central Government in revision petitions filed against the order of the State Government granting mining lease to respondent No.3. The petitioner was granted a mining lease over an area of 147.35 acres land situated in village Jauli, Tahsil Sihora, District Jabalpur. The mining lease granted on 31st July 1951 was for a period of 30 years, which was to end on 31st July 1981. The court heard both the writ petitions together and decided to quash the orders impugned in the writ petition.

The court order discusses the validity of an application for a mining lease and the applicable laws. The court determines that the law in effect at the time of consideration of the application should be applied, not the law in effect at the time of application. The court also examines the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of the law at the time of consideration. Ultimately, the court upholds the decision to grant the mining lease to the respondent No.3.

The court order specifies the documents and certificates that need to be furnished by the applicant, including a valid clearance certificate for payment of mining dues, income tax returns, and an affidavit stating that the applicant has obtained surface rights over the area or has obtained the consent of the owner for starting mining operations. The order also discusses the preferential right of certain persons to obtain a mining lease, subject to certain conditions. The court found that the application made by respondent No.3 was not valid and was not to be considered for grant of mining lease. The court also examined whether the petitioner was entitled to a preferential right over and above other applicants, and found that the petitioner did not have such a right.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 11 of the Act and the proviso added to sub-section (2), which gives preferential rights to applicants for grant of reconnaissance permit, prospecting license or mining lease. The court holds that no preferential right was available to the petitioner and that the order passed by the respondent-State in respect of the petitioner cannot be sustained. The court also notes that the entire consideration by the respondent-State was not in accordance with the directions of the Apex Court and, therefore, the order of the State Government as a whole is liable to be quashed.

The court order also discusses the issue of protection of forest land and notes that certain laws were not made at the time the land was allotted to the petitioner. The court found that a notification for mining purposes on forest land was issued without obtaining prior approval, and therefore, the notification was cancelled. The court ordered the State Government to consider all applications for mining lease, including the petitioner's, after obtaining prior approval from the Central Government. The court also stated that no preferential right would be given to the petitioner and the feasibility of the application would be considered.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to the grant of mining leases and the requirements for obtaining such leases. The court upholds the decision to grant the mining lease to the respondent No.3 and quashes the orders impugned in the writ petition. The court specifies the documents and certificates that need to be furnished by the applicant and discusses the preferential right of certain persons to obtain a mining lease, subject to certain conditions. The court also notes that the entire consideration by the respondent-State was not in accordance with the directions of the Apex Court and, therefore, the order of the State Government as a whole is liable to be quashed. The court orders the State Government to consider all applications for mining lease, including the petitioner's, after obtaining prior approval from the Central Government.
