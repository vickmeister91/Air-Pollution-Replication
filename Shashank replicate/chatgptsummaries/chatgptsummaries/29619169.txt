The court order in question pertains to an application made by the prosecution seeking permission to take on record two registers that were seized in a connected FIR but inadvertently not taken on record in the present case. The prosecution argues that the registers are relevant to the case and have been relied upon by a witness. The accused do not oppose the application, except for one who argues that it is an afterthought and an attempt to fill up lacunae in the prosecution case.

The court, after hearing both sides, allows the application. The court states that the power of the court under Section 311 Cr.P.C. is very wide and can be exercised at any stage. The purpose of the trial is discovery of truth, and any relevant evidence should not be declined to be taken on record on technical objections. The court further notes that the accused can recall and re-examine any witness if required, and copies of the registers should be made available to them before the cross-examination of the relevant witness.

Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers the court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, even though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in dispute. The section also allows the court to allow any document to be produced or any witness to be examined, if it is necessary for the just decision of the case.

In this case, the prosecution argued that the two registers were relevant to the case and had been relied upon by a witness. The accused did not oppose the application, except for one who argued that it was an afterthought and an attempt to fill up lacunae in the prosecution case. However, the court noted that the power of the court under Section 311 Cr.P.C. is very wide and can be exercised at any stage. The court further noted that the purpose of the trial is discovery of truth, and any relevant evidence should not be declined to be taken on record on technical objections.

The court's decision in this case is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all relevant evidence be considered before arriving at a just decision. The court's decision also ensures that the accused have a fair trial and are not prejudiced by the non-production of relevant evidence.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of proper investigation and documentation by the investigating agencies. In this case, the registers were inadvertently not taken on record in the present case, despite being seized in a connected FIR. This highlights the need for proper documentation and record-keeping by the investigating agencies, to ensure that all relevant evidence is produced before the court.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is in line with the principles of natural justice and ensures that all relevant evidence is considered before arriving at a just decision. The decision also highlights the importance of proper investigation and documentation by the investigating agencies, to ensure that all relevant evidence is produced before the court.
