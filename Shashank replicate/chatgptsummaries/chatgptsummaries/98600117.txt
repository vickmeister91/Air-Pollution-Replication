The Supreme Court of India recently heard a petition in the case of T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India and others, along with three interlocutory applications related to forest conservation. The court ordered Central Coalfields Ltd. to file an affidavit regarding the filing of a fresh application under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act and listed the matter for hearing on August 5, 2019. This order was made in response to a petition filed by T.N. Godavarman seeking to prevent the destruction of forests in India.

The Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. Section 2 of the Act requires that any proposal to divert forest land for non-forestry purposes must be approved by the Central Government. The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Committee for Conservation of Forests and Wildlife to oversee the implementation of the Act.

In the case of T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India and others, the petitioner had alleged that Central Coalfields Ltd. had violated the Forest Conservation Act by carrying out mining activities in forest areas without obtaining the necessary approvals. The petitioner had also alleged that the government had failed to take action against the company for these violations.

The court's order requiring Central Coalfields Ltd. to file an affidavit regarding the filing of a fresh application under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act is significant because it indicates that the court is taking a serious view of the company's alleged violations of the Act. The court's decision to list the matter for hearing on August 5, 2019, suggests that it intends to closely monitor the company's compliance with the Act.

In addition to the order regarding Central Coalfields Ltd., the court also ordered the government to place a notification on record within seven days regarding an application for impleadment and directions in the case of Nitin Ram Menon, Maharashtra, and listed the matter for hearing on August 23, 2019. This order was made in response to a petition filed by Nitin Ram Menon seeking to prevent the destruction of forests in Maharashtra.

The court's decision to order the government to place a notification on record regarding the application for impleadment and directions is significant because it indicates that the court is taking a proactive approach to forest conservation. The court's decision to list the matter for hearing on August 23, 2019, suggests that it intends to closely monitor the government's actions in this regard.

Finally, in the case of Kudiyalathur Reserved Forests, State of Tamil Nadu, the court listed the matter for hearing on September 23, 2019, and ordered the Central Empowered Committee to examine the issue and submit its recommendations in the meantime. This order was made in response to a petition filed by the State of Tamil Nadu seeking to prevent the destruction of forests in the Kudiyalathur Reserved Forests.

The court's decision to order the Central Empowered Committee to examine the issue and submit its recommendations is significant because it indicates that the court is taking a scientific approach to forest conservation. The court's decision to list the matter for hearing on September 23, 2019, suggests that it intends to closely monitor the committee's recommendations and take appropriate action based on those recommendations.

In conclusion, the recent orders of the Supreme Court of India in the cases of T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India and others, Nitin Ram Menon, Maharashtra, and Kudiyalathur Reserved Forests, State of Tamil Nadu, demonstrate the court's commitment to forest conservation. The court's orders requiring Central Coalfields Ltd. to file an affidavit regarding the filing of a fresh application under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, ordering the government to place a notification on record regarding an application for impleadment and directions, and ordering the Central Empowered Committee to examine the issue and submit its recommendations, all indicate that the court is taking a proactive and scientific approach to forest conservation. It remains to be seen how these orders will be implemented and whether they will have a significant impact on forest conservation in India.
