The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by Sudhakar Raman, who sought to quash a summon issued to him by the police under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioner argued that he cannot be summoned under Section 160 as he has already been treated as an accused. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner has not been arrayed as an accused in the complaint and that the police have the duty to make a fair and proper inquiry.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not been formally charged with any crime, and therefore could not claim to be treated as an accused. The court also noted that the police have a duty to conduct a fair and proper inquiry, which includes summoning individuals who may have information relevant to the case.

In dismissing the petition, the court ordered the petitioner to appear before the police and put forth his case. This means that the petitioner will have to cooperate with the police and provide any information or evidence that may be relevant to the case.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of due process in criminal investigations. While individuals may feel that they are being unfairly targeted by the police, it is important to remember that the police have a duty to conduct a thorough and fair investigation, and that individuals who may have information relevant to the case may be summoned to provide that information.
