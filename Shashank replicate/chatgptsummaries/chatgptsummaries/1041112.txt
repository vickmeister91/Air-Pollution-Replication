The petitioners claimed that the 5th respondent was running a 24-hour hospital without prior sanction from the concerned authorities, violating various rules and causing environmental distress and nuisance to other occupants.

The case was heard in the Madras High Court, and the court found that the 5th respondent was indeed running a 24-hour clinic, which required special sanction from the authorities, and that no such permission had been granted.

The court order also stated that the 5th respondent must obtain permission from the competent authority under the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act if they wish to use their residential building as a clinic or consulting room. The appropriate authority must consider the purpose for which permission is required, the suitability of the place, and the future development and maintenance of the area. The 5th respondent must not use the portion for any purpose other than residential until they obtain permission.

The court found that the hospital was being run without prior sanction from the concerned authorities, which was a violation of various acts. The court ordered the authorities to take action against the respondents 5 to 7 to close the hospital and prohibit them from using the premises in violation of any provisions of the relevant acts.
