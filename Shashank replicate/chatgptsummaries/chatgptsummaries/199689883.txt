The court has recently issued two separate orders in connection with bail applications filed by Sureshkumar Asuram Bisnoi. In the first order, the court allowed the bail application filed by Bisnoi in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under Sections 65(A) (E), 81, 83, 98, 99 of Prohibition Act. Bisnoi's counsel argued that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated, and that the investigation is over and charge-sheet filed, so there is no possibility of tampering with evidence. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail on certain conditions, including executing a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and surrendering his passport. The applicant must also mark his presence before the concerned Police Station on every Monday of each English calendar month for a period of three months and thereafter, alternate Monday for a period of six months.

In the second order, the court has ordered that the applicant must execute a bail bond and follow certain conditions, including not leaving the country without permission, reporting to the court, and not changing residence without prior permission. The applicant is also not allowed to enter the Banaskantha District for six months. If any of these conditions are breached, the Sessions Judge can issue a warrant or take appropriate action. The trial court should not be influenced by the observations made by this court while granting bail. The rule is made absolute to the extent mentioned in the order.
