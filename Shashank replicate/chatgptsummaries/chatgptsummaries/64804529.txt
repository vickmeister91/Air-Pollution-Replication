Ramco Industries Ltd, a company operating an industrial plant in Bihar, filed a writ petition to quash an order by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) to close their plant with immediate effect. The order was issued under section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner argued that the order was without jurisdiction and violated the principles of natural justice. The petitioner also argued that the appeal pending before the appellate authority, of which the Chairman of the Board is also a member, has become a futile exercise. The petitioner relied on several judgments to support their arguments.

In response, the respondents argued that the orders were pending consideration before the appellate authority and that the petitioner should exhaust their statutory remedy before approaching the court. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided to reserve its opinion on the merits of the case, while also noting the existence of a special forum for environmental pollution matters.

In another court order, the petitioner sought to quash an order of closure and refusal to renew consent for their industrial unit. The petitioner argued that the orders were based on an illegal inspection report and had been passed in a mechanical fashion. The respondents argued that the orders were pending consideration before the appellate authority and that the petitioner should exhaust their statutory remedy before approaching the court. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided to reserve its opinion on the merits of the case, while also noting the existence of a special forum for environmental pollution matters.

In a third court order, the petitioner's industrial plant was ordered to be closed under section 31A of the Air Act by the Chairman of the BSPCB. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds of absence of jurisdiction, judicial bias, and violation of principles of natural justice. The court found that the order was unsustainable as it was passed without show cause and without an opportunity of hearing. The court also noted that the statutory obligation cast under sections 26 and 27 of the Air Act and sections 21 and 22 of the Water Act had not been discharged by the authorities of the Board. The court further observed that until appropriate measures were taken for reconstitution of the Board or the appellate authority, there was no forum available for the persons aggrieved to question any order passed by the Chairman as the delegate of the State Board.

In a fourth court order, the court discussed a resolution passed by the BSPCB delegating powers to the Chairman of the Board under the Water Act and the Air Act. The court found that the resolution was faulty and did not confer jurisdiction on the Chairman to exercise powers under section 31A of the Air Act. The court upheld the argument that the Chairman exceeded their jurisdiction in passing an order under section 31A of the Air Act. The court also discussed the availability of alternative remedies and cited a Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court to state that the existence of an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar for invoking the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of the court.

In a fifth court order, the court discussed the possibility of obtaining a review by certiorari if an appeal has not been perfected due to no fault of the appellant. The court may issue a writ of certiorari to correct errors of an inferior court or tribunal if it has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or if it has conducted proceedings in a manner contrary to natural justice and accepted rules of procedure. The order also highlighted the importance of adherence to principles of natural justice and the right to notice and being heard. The petitioner in this case was not given notice or an opportunity to be heard before an extreme order of closure was passed against them, and the court finds this to be a violation of natural justice.

In the final court order, the court stated that even if a statute does not explicitly require a pre-decisional hearing, a minimum hearing must be given to the person affected if the action taken involves civil consequences of a grave nature. The order passed by the Chairman of the BSPCB without notice and opportunity of hearing to the petitioner violates the principles of natural justice. The order was quashed and set aside. The appeal filed by the petitioner cannot be heard until corrective measures are taken by the State Government. Until a final order is passed, the petitioner's industrial unit should be allowed to operate under the supervisory regulatory control of the State Board. The writ petition was allowed with the aforementioned directions. The Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar was directed to take corrective measures for restoring the functioning of the appellate body constituted under the enactments in question.

In summary, Ramco Industries Ltd filed a writ petition to quash an order by the BSPCB to close their industrial plant with immediate effect. The court heard arguments from both sides and decided to reserve its opinion on the merits of the case, while also noting the existence of a special forum for environmental pollution matters.
