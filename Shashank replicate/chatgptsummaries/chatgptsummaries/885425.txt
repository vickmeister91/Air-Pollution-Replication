The Supreme Court of India recently issued a court order in a case involving the discharge of highly polluted trade effluents by an industrial unit owned by Modi Industries Ltd. into a river without the consent of the Pollution Control Board. The Board refused to grant consent and lodged a complaint against the respondents under s. 44 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The issue was whether the officials of the company could be prosecuted for the offense.

Initially, the court quashed the proceedings against the individuals, citing a lack of vicarious liability without a prosecution of the company. However, the court later determined that the individuals could be prosecuted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, as they were in charge of and responsible for the business of the industrial unit. The court held that officials of the company could be prosecuted as having been in charge and responsible for the business of the unit and deemed guilty of the offense.

The court also criticized the Board for drafting the complaint with technical flaws and without circumspection. The court emphasized the importance of preventing pollution of rivers and streams and the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws.

The court order further states that the company, Messrs Modi Industries Limited, was required to apply to the Board for consent to discharge its trade effluents into a stream, subject to certain conditions. However, the company did not have proper arrangements for treatment of the highly polluted trade effluents discharged by it and was intentionally avoiding compliance with the requirements of the Act.

The Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Managing Director, and members of the Board of Directors of the company were deemed to be guilty of the offense and liable to be proceeded against and punished under the Act. The court allowed the appeal and directed the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate to proceed with the trial as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the law.

This court order highlights the importance of strict enforcement of environmental laws and the need for companies to comply with regulations to prevent pollution of rivers and streams. The court held that officials of a company can be held responsible for the actions of the company and can be prosecuted for offenses committed by the company. The court also criticized the negligence of the legal advisors in drafting the complaint and emphasized the need for circumspection in such matters.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to companies to comply with environmental regulations and to take responsibility for their actions. It also emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws to protect the environment and prevent pollution of rivers and streams.
