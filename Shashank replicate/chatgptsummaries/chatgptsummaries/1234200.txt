The case of Kanhaiya Singh v. State Government and Others involved a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought to quash the order passed by the State Government and the District Magistrate, Sonbhadra, and to restrain respondent No. 4 from carrying out any mining operations in respect of plot No. 518/Ga Area 60 Acres of village Korgi, District Sonbhadra. The case revolved around a mining lease granted to J.P. Yadav, who had violated the terms and conditions of the permit to use a forest road and was unable to carry out mining operations over plots in village Khokha and Bodhadih.

The District Magistrate recommended that Yadav be given an extension of lease over Plot No. 518 Ga, village Korgi, for the period during which he allegedly failed to carry out mining operations over the other plots. However, the court found that Yadav could not claim an extension for the period during which he had violated the terms and conditions of the permit. The impugned order could not be sustained, and the court directed the respondent authority to complete the process of granting the lease in accordance with the rules.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to the terms and conditions of a permit or lease. Violating the terms and conditions can lead to the cancellation of the permit or lease and can result in legal action. In this case, Yadav's violation of the terms and conditions of the permit led to the cancellation of his extension of lease over Plot No. 518 Ga.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for transparency and fairness in the process of granting leases. The court directed the respondent authority to complete the process of granting the lease in accordance with the rules. This decision ensures that the process of granting leases is fair and transparent and that all parties involved adhere to the rules and regulations.

In conclusion, the case of Kanhaiya Singh v. State Government and Others highlights the importance of adhering to the terms and conditions of a permit or lease and the need for transparency and fairness in the process of granting leases. The court's decision ensures that the process of granting leases is fair and transparent and that all parties involved adhere to the rules and regulations.
