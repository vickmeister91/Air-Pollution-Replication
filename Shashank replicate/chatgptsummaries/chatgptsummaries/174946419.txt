The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by different parties against various government bodies, individuals, and societies registered under the Societies Act. The petitions raise questions about the powers and limitations of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in enforcing environmental laws and the meaning of the term "person aggrieved." The court has appointed a senior counsel as an Amicus Curiae to assist in interpreting the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and the Limitation Act.

The court order lists the respondents in several writ petitions, including the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, and various individuals and government departments. The court is attempting to reconcile the conflicting interests of citizens seeking compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects.

One of the petitions involves a partnership firm and a partner of the firm, who are petitioning against various government bodies and a society registered under the Societies Act. The second petition involves two individuals who are petitioning against the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, the State of Goa, and a private individual. No further details about the nature of the petitions or the court's ruling are provided.

Another petition is being heard separately, while the others are being disposed of together. The petitioner is a real estate company challenging a judgment and order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The respondents include various government bodies and authorities. The petitioner had applied for a Commencement Certificate before developing a plot of land, which was initially approved in 1993. The court has reserved its judgment on the matter.

The court order also pertains to a case involving the construction of a commercial and residential building in Goregaon, Mumbai. The petitioner had obtained necessary approvals and sanctions from the municipal corporation and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. However, the respondent filed an application before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) challenging the petitioner's right to construct the building. The NGT dismissed the petitioner's application, and the petitioner filed a writ petition challenging the NGT's order. The court held that the writ petition was maintainable and that the petitioner had a right to challenge the NGT's order. The court also held that the petitioner had exhausted all alternative remedies available to them and that the writ petition was not barred by any law.

In another case, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) brushed aside two judgments of the Coordinate Bench without giving reasons. The court found that the view taken by NGT Bench, Pune that the cause of action would arise from the date of knowledge of the original applicant about the alleged violation and secondly from the date on which Environmental Authorities do not take any action after violation is brought to their notice is not in accordance with law. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the Tribunal to decide afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The NGT was directed to decide all the issues within a period of three months.

Overall, the court order deals with various writ petitions filed by different parties against government bodies, individuals, and societies registered under the Societies Act. The court is attempting to reconcile the conflicting interests of citizens seeking compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects. The court has appointed a senior counsel as an Amicus Curiae to assist in interpreting the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and the Limitation Act. The court has heard arguments from all parties and found substance in the submissions made by the Amicus Curiae and the petitioners' senior counsels. The court has reserved its judgment on some of the cases and directed the NGT to decide all the issues within a period of three months in one of the cases.
