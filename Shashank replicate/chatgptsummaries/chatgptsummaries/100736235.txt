Abdulbeg Mohmedbeg Moghal filed a petition under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code and Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, requesting that the investigation in the case of his son's death and the death of Mariam be handed over to an independent agency like CID Crime or any other independent agency. The petitioner alleged that the investigating officer did not carry out proper investigation of the crime and filed a report under Section 174 of Cr.P.C. on 30.05.2012.

The court found that there was no material connecting the case of death of petitioner's son with the case of the death of Mariam, and therefore, the petitioner was not justified in seeking further investigation by CID (crime) in connection with the death of Mariam and/or in the case of his son which is committed to the Sessions Court for trial. The court disposed of the petition accordingly.
