The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed an order in a case where the applicants had filed a petition against an order passed by the Special Judge Vidisha. The applicants were facing trial on the basis of a complaint filed by the complainant under various sections of IPC and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. During the pendency of the trial, the applicants moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to bring on record a report dated 14/07/2014, which was found to be false. However, the trial court rejected the application, and the applicants approached the High Court.

The High Court observed that the contents of the application were not wide enough to substantiate the cause of the applicants to call the documents/report dated 14/07/2014. The court directed the applicants to file a fresh application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. with better particulars and sufficient cause to plead and prove their innocence, which shall be considered by the trial court in accordance with law. The order dated 30/08/2017 was set aside, and the petition was disposed of with the aforementioned liberty.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order production of documents or other things. It states that the court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, order the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of such inquiry, trial or other proceeding. The section also provides that the court may, if it thinks fit, order the person in whose possession or power the document or thing is, to produce it or to attend and produce it.

In the present case, the applicants had moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to bring on record a report dated 14/07/2014, which was found to be false. However, the trial court rejected the application on the grounds that the contents of the application were not wide enough to substantiate the cause of the applicants to call the documents/report dated 14/07/2014.

The High Court, while setting aside the order of the trial court, directed the applicants to file a fresh application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. with better particulars and sufficient cause to plead and prove their innocence. The court also observed that the trial court shall consider the application in accordance with law.

The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is an Indian law that seeks to prevent atrocities or offences against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Act provides for special courts for the trial of offences under the Act and also provides for the appointment of special public prosecutors.

In the present case, the applicants were facing trial under various sections of IPC and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The Act provides for stringent punishment for offences committed against members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Act also provides for the protection of the rights of members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court's order in this case highlights the importance of following due process of law and ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected. The court's direction to the applicants to file a fresh application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. with better particulars and sufficient cause to plead and prove their innocence is a reminder that the law must be followed in letter and spirit.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's order in this case is a significant development in the ongoing trial of the applicants.
