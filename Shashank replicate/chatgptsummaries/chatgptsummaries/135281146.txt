Yunish Khan had filed a revision against an order passed by the Special Judge, Dindori, in Special Sessions Trial No. 03/15. The charges against him were framed for the offences punishable under Sections 366 and 376 (2) (n) of the IPC. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., praying that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Dindori, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix in which she had stated that the applicant had not committed any sexual offence upon her.

However, the learned trial Judge had rejected the application vide the impugned order holding that the application was not maintainable at this stage and had levelled charges against the applicant for the offences punishable under Sections 366 and 376 (2) (n) of the IPC. The court had dismissed the revision filed by the applicant and directed the learned trial Judge to re-consider the applicant's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. with accordance with the law before recording of the prosecutrix's evidence.

The case involved charges of sexual offences against Yunish Khan. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which allows the court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The applicant had prayed that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Dindori, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix in which she had stated that the applicant had not committed any sexual offence upon her.

The learned trial Judge had rejected the application, stating that it was not maintainable at this stage. The court had also levelled charges against the applicant for the offences punishable under Sections 366 and 376 (2) (n) of the IPC. The applicant had then filed a revision against this order.

The court had dismissed the revision filed by the applicant and directed the learned trial Judge to re-consider the applicant's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. with accordance with the law before recording of the prosecutrix's evidence. This meant that the learned trial Judge would have to consider the applicant's application again and decide whether it was maintainable or not.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the applicant had a right to produce evidence in his defence. The court had also noted that the statement of the prosecutrix was an important piece of evidence in the case. Therefore, the court had directed the learned trial Judge to re-consider the applicant's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. before recording of the prosecutrix's evidence.

In conclusion, the court had dismissed the revision filed by Yunish Khan against the order passed by the Special Judge, Dindori, in Special Sessions Trial No. 03/15. The court had directed the learned trial Judge to re-consider the applicant's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. with accordance with the law before recording of the prosecutrix's evidence. This decision was based on the fact that the applicant had a right to produce evidence in his defence and that the statement of the prosecutrix was an important piece of evidence in the case.
