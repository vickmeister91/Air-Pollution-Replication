The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Sri N. Kallappa against the State of Karnataka and Sri Fayaz Ahamed. The petitioner and the second respondent are court officials who were tried and acquitted of an offense punishable under section 379 IPC. The State appealed against the acquittal, and the court set aside the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for retrial of both accused.

During the retrial, the trial court accepted an application filed under section 91 Cr.P.C. by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor for the production of documents. The petitioner challenged this decision by filing a revision petition under section 397 and 401 Cr.P.C. The court, however, dismissed the revision petition, stating that the summoning of documents under section 91 Cr.P.C. is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged under section 397 or 401 Cr.P.C.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This section is often used by the prosecution to obtain documents that are in the possession of the accused or any other person.

Sections 397 and 401 of the Cr.P.C. deal with the powers of revision of the High Court and the Sessions Court, respectively. These sections empower these courts to call for and examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior court for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order, and to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice.

In the present case, the trial court had accepted an application filed under section 91 Cr.P.C. by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor for the production of documents. The petitioner challenged this decision by filing a revision petition under section 397 and 401 Cr.P.C. The court, however, dismissed the revision petition, stating that the summoning of documents under section 91 Cr.P.C. is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged under section 397 or 401 Cr.P.C.

The term "interlocutory order" refers to an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and does not finally determine the rights of the parties. Such orders are generally not appealable, as they do not finally dispose of the case. The rationale behind this is that allowing appeals against interlocutory orders would lead to delay and obstruction of the trial process.

In the present case, the court held that the summoning of documents under section 91 Cr.P.C. is an interlocutory order, as it does not finally determine the rights of the parties. The court further held that such orders cannot be challenged under section 397 or 401 Cr.P.C., as these sections deal with the revisional powers of the High Court and the Sessions Court, respectively, and are meant to be used only in cases where the rights of the parties have been finally determined.

The implications of this court order are significant, as it clarifies the scope of revisional powers under the Cr.P.C. It establishes that interlocutory orders, such as the summoning of documents under section 91 Cr.P.C., cannot be challenged under section 397 or 401 Cr.P.C. This is in line with the principle of expeditious disposal of cases, as it prevents unnecessary delays and obstruction of the trial process.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Sri N. Kallappa against the State of Karnataka and Sri Fayaz Ahamed. The court dismissed the revision petition, stating that the summoning of documents under section 91 Cr.P.C. is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged under section 397 or 401 Cr.P.C. This clarifies the scope of revisional powers under the Cr.P.C. and establishes that interlocutory orders cannot be challenged under these sections. This is in line with the principle of expeditious disposal of cases, as it prevents unnecessary delays and obstruction of the trial process.
