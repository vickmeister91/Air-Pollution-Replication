The court order pertains to a dispute between M/S Kalsi Buildcon Private Limited and the State of Jharkhand. The petitioner had entered into a contract with the state government for the construction of a road. As per the contract, the petitioner was required to furnish bank guarantees as security for the performance of the contract. However, the state government terminated the contract and demanded that the petitioner deposit a sum of money as compensation for the losses incurred by the government due to the termination of the contract.

The petitioner challenged the demand made by the state government and sought relief from liabilities under the contract. The petitioner also sought the release of bank guarantees furnished by them. However, the state government rejected the petitioner's claim and directed them to deposit the sum of money demanded by them.

The court held that the petition did not involve any public law element and that the disputed factual issue could not be adjudicated under extraordinary writ jurisdiction. The petitioner was given the liberty to take appropriate recourse as provided under the law. The court order does not affect the petitioner's case in any other forum or court.
