The Karnataka High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by Sri Kempa Shetty against the State of Karnataka and others. The petitioner's electricity supply was disconnected after an elephant was electrocuted on his land, and a criminal case was filed against him and his family members. The petitioner claimed innocence and argued that the electricity supply could only be stopped in the event of a second and subsequent conviction. 

The court found that the denial of electricity supply for over two years and seven months was illegal and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. The court quashed the impugned endorsement and directed the respondents to restore the supply of electricity to the petitioner's installation within ten days.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to basic amenities such as electricity. The court observed that the petitioner's electricity supply was disconnected without following due process of law and without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The court also noted that the petitioner was not convicted of any offence related to the electrocution of the elephant, and therefore, the disconnection of his electricity supply was not justified.

The court's decision is also significant as it highlights the need for the authorities to follow due process of law while taking action against individuals. The court observed that the authorities cannot take arbitrary action against individuals without following the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the authorities cannot deny basic amenities such as electricity to individuals without any justification.

The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on similar cases where individuals are denied basic amenities such as electricity without any justification. The court's decision is also likely to serve as a deterrent to the authorities from taking arbitrary action against individuals without following due process of law.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision in Sri Kempa Shetty's case is a significant step towards upholding the fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The court's decision highlights the need for the authorities to follow due process of law while taking action against individuals and to justify their actions with valid reasons. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on similar cases and serve as a deterrent to the authorities from taking arbitrary action against individuals without following due process of law.
