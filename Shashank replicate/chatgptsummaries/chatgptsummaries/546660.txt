In a recent court order, the New G.I.D.C. Housing Association was found to be in violation of air pollution control regulations. The State of Gujarat had served notice to the unit in question for failing to provide adequate air pollution control equipment and for emitting particulate matter SO2 and NO2 into the atmosphere. Additionally, the unit was found to have failed to operate and maintain air pollution control equipment efficiently.

As a result of these violations, the court directed the unit to take several measures to reduce its impact on the environment and nearby residential areas. Specifically, the unit was directed to procure a green belt along the periphery of the unit and to plant trees in three rows to reduce the propagation of noise towards the residential area. This measure is intended to mitigate the impact of the unit's operations on nearby residents and to promote a healthier environment.

In addition to these measures, the court also directed the unit to place on record the figures of turnover for the last three years. This requirement is intended to ensure that the unit is operating in compliance with all relevant regulations and to provide transparency regarding its financial performance.

Overall, this court order represents an important step towards promoting environmental sustainability and protecting the health and well-being of nearby residents. By requiring the unit to take concrete steps to reduce its impact on the environment and nearby communities, the court has sent a clear message that environmental regulations must be taken seriously and that violators will be held accountable for their actions.
