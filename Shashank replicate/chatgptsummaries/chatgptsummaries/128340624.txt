The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently granted bail to Samal Singh, who had been in custody since January 28, 2018, for hunting wild boar along with two other co-accused persons. The court deemed it appropriate to grant bail to the applicant on his furnishing a personal bond in a sum of Rs.40,000/- with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned CJM for his appearance in the trial Court on the dates so fixed by that Court during the trial.

The case involved the hunting of wild boar, which is illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The accused were charged with violating the provisions of the Act and were arrested by the forest department officials. The accused had been in custody for over three years, and their bail applications had been rejected by the lower courts.

The High Court, while granting bail to Samal Singh, considered various factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the evidence against the accused, and the possibility of the accused absconding or tampering with the evidence. The court observed that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period and that the trial was likely to take some time to conclude. The court also noted that the accused had no criminal antecedents and that there was no likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with the evidence.

The court, therefore, deemed it appropriate to grant bail to the accused on certain conditions. The accused was required to furnish a personal bond in a sum of Rs.40,000/- with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned CJM. The accused was also required to appear in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial. The court further directed the accused not to leave the country without the permission of the court and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused has been welcomed by many, as it is seen as a step towards ensuring that the accused are not subjected to prolonged detention without trial. The court's decision is also seen as a recognition of the fact that bail is a rule and not an exception, and that the accused should be granted bail unless there are compelling reasons to deny it.

In conclusion, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh's decision to grant bail to Samal Singh, who had been in custody for over three years for hunting wild boar, is a welcome step towards ensuring that the accused are not subjected to prolonged detention without trial. The court's decision is also a recognition of the fact that bail is a rule and not an exception, and that the accused should be granted bail unless there are compelling reasons to deny it. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused on certain conditions is a reminder that the accused must comply with the conditions of bail and not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.
