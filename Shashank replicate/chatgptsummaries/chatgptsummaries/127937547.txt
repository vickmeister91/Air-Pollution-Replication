The first case pertains to an appeal made by the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. against an award made by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in favour of the claimants. The appellant-insurer questioned the direction to satisfy the award with the right of recovery. However, the court held that the Tribunal had not committed any error in directing the appellant-insurer to satisfy the award at the first instance and to recover the same from the owner-insured.

The court order highlights the importance of protecting the rights of third parties in vehicular accidents and the necessity of insurance against third party risk. The court emphasized that the purpose of third-party insurance is to ensure that victims of accidents can receive compensation for injuries or death. The court also noted that the Motor Vehicles Act makes third party insurance compulsory for motor vehicles, and failure to comply with this provision constitutes a breach.

The case involved an owner-insured who committed a breach by failing to obtain third-party insurance. The court directed the insurer to satisfy the award with the right of recovery, and the appeal was dismissed. The awarded amount was released to the claimants.
