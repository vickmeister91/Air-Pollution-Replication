The conditions for anticipatory bail are laid down under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. and include requirements such as the person must cooperate with the investigation, not tamper with evidence, and not commit any further offenses while on bail.

In this case, the court has granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on the condition that he surrenders within four weeks and furnishes a bail bond with two sureties. The court has also specified that the bail bond must be to the satisfaction of A.C.J.M., Rajmahal in connection with Complaint Case No. 160 of 2017. This suggests that there may be other cases or complaints against the petitioner that are related to the same or similar offenses.

It is not clear from the court order what the specific allegations against the petitioner are, but it is clear that they relate to violations of forest laws in India. The Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act are both aimed at protecting and conserving forests in the country, and violations of these laws can result in serious consequences.
