The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Rahul, also known as Deepak, in connection with a case registered against him for the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand by a tractor. Rahul has been in custody since January 23, 2019, and the charge sheet has already been filed.

During the hearing, the court allowed the bail application and directed Rahul to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one solvent surety in the same amount. However, the court also imposed certain conditions that Rahul must comply with in order to remain out on bail.

One of the conditions is that Rahul must cooperate fully with the investigation and trial. This means that he must make himself available to the authorities whenever required and provide any information or evidence that may be relevant to the case.

Another condition is that Rahul must not commit a similar offense while out on bail. This is to ensure that he does not engage in any illegal activities that could jeopardize the ongoing investigation or trial.

Finally, the court also ordered that Rahul must not leave India without the permission of the trial court or the Investigating Officer. This is to prevent him from fleeing the country and avoiding prosecution.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Rahul is a significant development in this case. However, it is important to note that he must comply with the conditions imposed by the court in order to remain out on bail. Failure to do so could result in his bail being revoked and him being sent back to custody.
