The Delhi High Court recently heard a case in which Vayam Technologies Ltd challenged system-generated notices issued by the Value Added Tax Officers (VATOs) of the Department of Trade & Taxes. The notices were issued under Section 59(2) of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004, and uploaded on the department's website. During the hearing, the court was informed that the Commissioner of VAT had passed an order withdrawing all the notices issued to the petitioner. 

The petitioner argued that no rule had been framed under Section 102(2)(z) of the DVAT Act in regard to the exercise of the power under Section 59(2) thereof. The court adjourned the case to examine the issue. The petitioner also provided details of VAT statutes in other states, where similar provisions exist, and rules have been framed in terms of the said provision.

In the subsequent court order, various state VAT acts and their corresponding sections were listed. The petitioner argued that the power under Section 59(2) of the Delhi VAT Act cannot be exercised as no rules have been framed for it, citing previous court decisions. The petitioner also provided examples of indiscriminate exercise of this power by VATOs. The respondent argued that there are sufficient guidelines to prevent misuse and cited previous court decisions. 

The court concluded that the expression "as may be prescribed" in Section 59(2) requires rules to be framed for inspection of production of records. The court cited a previous Supreme Court decision to support this interpretation. The court order discusses various legal cases and interpretations of different sections of acts. It concludes that the power of the Commissioner under Section 59 (2) of the DVAT Act to call upon a person to produce books of accounts and other documents can be exercised even in the absence of rules being framed under Section 102 (2) (z) of the DVAT Act. 

The court cannot issue a mandamus to the Executive to frame a rule, but the petitioner can make a representation to the Government of NCT of Delhi to frame rules. No other directions are given.

In summary, the Delhi High Court heard a case in which Vayam Technologies Ltd challenged system-generated notices issued by the VATOs of the Department of Trade & Taxes.
