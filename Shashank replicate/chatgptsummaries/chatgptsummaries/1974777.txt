The court order in question pertains to an appeal against an order passed by the Civil Judge in a case. The District Judge set aside the order and sent the case back to the trial court for disposal according to law. However, the respondent argued that the appeal was not competent as the decree passed by the first appellate court was based on the consent of parties. The court held that if the decree was passed on the basis of consent, no appeal would lie. 

The court found that the decree was passed on the basis of consent given by the advocates of the parties and, therefore, dismissed the appeal. This decision was based on the principle that if parties have given their consent to a decree, they cannot later challenge it. The court also clarified that an order of remand can be a decree if it conclusively determines the rights of the parties arising in the appeal.

The concept of consent decree is an important one in the legal system. It refers to a decree that is passed with the consent of the parties involved in a case. This means that the parties have agreed to the terms of the decree and have given their consent to it. Once a consent decree is passed, it becomes binding on the parties and cannot be challenged later. 

In the case at hand, the court found that the decree was passed on the basis of consent given by the advocates of the parties. This means that the parties had agreed to the terms of the decree and had given their consent to it. As a result, the court held that no appeal would lie against the decree. 

The court also clarified that an order of remand can be a decree if it conclusively determines the rights of the parties arising in the appeal. This means that if an order of remand conclusively determines the rights of the parties, it can be considered a decree and cannot be challenged later. 

The decision of the court in this case highlights the importance of consent in legal proceedings. It also emphasizes the need for parties to carefully consider the terms of any decree before giving their consent to it. Once a consent decree is passed, it becomes binding on the parties and cannot be challenged later. 

Overall, the court order in this case serves as an important reminder of the role of consent in legal proceedings. It also highlights the need for parties to carefully consider the terms of any decree before giving their consent to it. By doing so, parties can avoid any potential legal disputes that may arise later on.
