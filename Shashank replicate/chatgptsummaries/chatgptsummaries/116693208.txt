The Rajasthan High Court recently received multiple petitions from stone crusher owners who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court had previously allowed the owners to appear before the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board to address the issues, but the Board refused to grant consent to operate to the petitioners. The Board also issued orders to close the units, leading to the owners filing petitions with the court.

The Board argued that the owners had an alternate remedy available to them, but the owners claimed that the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the Board had the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution. However, the court also noted that the orders issued by the Board were non-speaking orders and violated principles of natural justice. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration.

The court order discusses the powers of the State Board under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, including the power to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The order also addresses the right to file an appeal against an order, but not against directions, and the circumstances under which the writ jurisdiction of a High Court can be invoked. The petitioners in the case had challenged orders passed by the Board under Sections 21 and 31A of the Act, alleging violations of natural justice and their fundamental rights. The Board argued that it had followed due process and given valid reasons for its decisions.

The court order discusses the legal requirements for granting consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond adequately. The court also noted that the Board did not follow proper procedures in revoking the consent order and closing down the unit. Overall, the court found that the Board's actions were legally unsustainable and ordered that the unit be allowed to operate.

In another case, the court order grants a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that has defaulted in complying with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher did not have adequate pollution control measures during an inspection and that the Board did not provide evidence that the deficiencies were not corrected. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders but directed the Board to consider the applications for renewal of consent and inspect the sites to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government is directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has been dealing with multiple petitions from stone crusher owners who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court has noted that the Board has the power to inspect and issue directions to prevent air pollution, but the orders issued by the Board were non-speaking orders and violated principles of natural justice. The court has ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration. The court has also discussed the legal requirements for granting consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas and found that the Board did not follow proper procedures in revoking the consent order and closing down the unit. The court has ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones.
