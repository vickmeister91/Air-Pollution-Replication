The petitioners filed a review petition challenging the Division Bench's order. The court examined the scope of review proceedings and the contentions of the parties.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the court in relation to private and public sector banks in the case of non-performing assets. It states that while private law functions of private bodies cannot be challenged under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, their public law functions can be subject to writ jurisdiction. The order also explains the difference between public and private law and the types of bodies that fall under each category. It further discusses the use of mandamus and certiorari as public law remedies and their applicability to private bodies. The order concludes by stating that a writ of mandamus can be issued for statutory violation by a private body, including private banks.

The court order discusses the circumstances under which a writ petition can be filed against private companies or individuals. It states that private companies carrying on banking business cannot be considered institutions carrying out statutory or public duties and are only amenable to writ jurisdiction if they fail to comply with statutory obligations or obligations of a public nature. The order also clarifies that service conditions of employees of private companies cannot be enforced through writ proceedings unless they are governed by statutory regulations. The order also discusses a previous case where the court held that an agreement of sale is not prohibited by Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act and that such an agreement would be subject to the mortgage already created by the borrower in favor of the bank. The court held that this finding is binding inter-parties and cannot be re-litigated.

The court order states that an agreement of sale is not prohibited by Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act, but it would be subject to the mortgage already created by the borrower in favor of the bank. The court also states that an appeal would lie to the appellate authority under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, and hence the same cannot be questioned before the Court compelling it to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court also mentions that the existence of an alternative remedy is not a bar for invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court concludes that the contentions urged by the petitioner cannot be examined on merits and the review petition fails and is dismissed.
