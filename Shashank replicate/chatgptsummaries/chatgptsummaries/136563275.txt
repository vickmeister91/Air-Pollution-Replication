The recent court order in the case between Viom Networks Ltd. and the State of Madhya Pradesh has brought to light an important issue regarding the regulation of diesel generators under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner, a telecommunications company, was served notices by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board stating that their diesel generators fell under the category of "industrial plant" and required prior authorization under the Act. The Pollution Board also demanded a fee of Rs. 25,000 per diesel generator set for five years for handling hazardous wastes.

The petitioner and other companies jointly objected to this, stating that they were not governed by the Act and Rules. The court directed the Pollution Board to decide on the objection by a reasoned order before taking any action under the Act and Rules. This decision has far-reaching implications for the regulation of diesel generators in the country.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was enacted to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures for the prevention and control of air pollution. The Act defines "industrial plant" as any plant or equipment used in any industrial process, and includes any stack or chimney attached to such plant or equipment.

The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, in its notices to Viom Networks Ltd. and other companies, had classified their diesel generators as "industrial plant" and demanded that they obtain prior authorization under the Act. The Pollution Board also demanded a fee of Rs. 25,000 per diesel generator set for five years for handling hazardous wastes.

The petitioner and other companies objected to this classification, stating that their diesel generators were not "industrial plant" as defined under the Act. They argued that their diesel generators were used for backup power supply and were not part of any industrial process. They also argued that the fee demanded by the Pollution Board was arbitrary and without any basis in law.

The court, in its order, directed the Pollution Board to decide on the objection by a reasoned order before taking any action under the Act and Rules. This decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of the Act and the powers of the Pollution Control Boards in regulating diesel generators.

The court's decision also highlights the need for a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for diesel generators in the country. Diesel generators are widely used in India as a backup power supply due to the frequent power outages. However, they are also a major source of air pollution, particularly in urban areas.

The regulation of diesel generators falls under the purview of both the Central and State Pollution Control Boards. However, there is no uniformity in the regulations across the country. Some states have stringent regulations, while others have lax regulations. This has led to a situation where diesel generators are often operated without any regard for the environment or public health.

The court's decision in the Viom Networks Ltd. case is a step in the right direction towards a more comprehensive and uniform regulatory framework for diesel generators. It emphasizes the need for a reasoned and evidence-based approach to regulation, rather than arbitrary and ad-hoc measures.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the case between Viom Networks Ltd. and the State of Madhya Pradesh has important implications for the regulation of diesel generators under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's decision clarifies the scope of the Act and the powers of the Pollution Control Boards in regulating diesel generators. It also highlights the need for a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for diesel generators in the country.
