In a recent court order, a criminal misc. petition filed by Deshraj against the State of Rajasthan was dismissed. The petition sought to quash an FIR registered against Deshraj for an offense under section 9/51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Deshraj argued that only officers above the rank of Assistant Director of Wild Life Preservation or Wild Life Warden have the power to investigate such cases. However, the court ruled that even a sub-inspector of the police has the power to investigate under section 50 of the Act, and therefore, the FIR cannot be quashed.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act empowers the government to declare any area as a sanctuary, national park, or closed area for the protection of wild animals and plants. It also provides for the regulation of hunting, possession, and trade in wild animals and plants.

Section 9 of the Act deals with the hunting of wild animals. It prohibits the hunting of any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act, except as provided under section 11 and section 12. Section 51 of the Act provides for the punishment for offenses under the Act. It states that whoever contravenes any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.

In the present case, Deshraj was accused of hunting a wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, or IV of the Act, without any permission or authority. The FIR was registered against him under section 9/51 of the Act. Deshraj challenged the FIR on the ground that only officers above the rank of Assistant Director of Wild Life Preservation or Wild Life Warden have the power to investigate such cases.

The court, however, rejected Deshraj's argument and held that even a sub-inspector of the police has the power to investigate under section 50 of the Act. Section 50 of the Act provides for the power of entry, search, arrest, and detention. It states that any forest officer or any police officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector may enter and search any premises, vehicle, or vessel, and may arrest any person whom he has reason to believe to have committed an offense under the Act.

The court observed that the power to investigate under section 50 of the Act is not limited to forest officers or officers above the rank of Assistant Director of Wild Life Preservation or Wild Life Warden. It held that any police officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector can investigate offenses under the Act. Therefore, the court dismissed Deshraj's petition and upheld the validity of the FIR registered against him.

In conclusion, the court order in the present case clarifies the power of investigation under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. It establishes that even a sub-inspector of the police has the power to investigate offenses under the Act, and the power is not limited to forest officers or officers above the rank of Assistant Director of Wild Life Preservation or Wild Life Warden. The order reinforces the importance of protecting wild animals and plants and upholding the provisions of the Act.
