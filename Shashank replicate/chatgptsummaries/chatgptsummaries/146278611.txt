Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a dispute over the use of land for non-forest activities. The first case involves a property where the plaintiffs had established a stone crusher unit, but the defendants had obstructed the passage. The defendants argued that the property was vested with the Government of Kerala and that the suit was not maintainable. The trial court and appellate court both dismissed the suit, but the court order discusses the provisions of various enactments and substantial questions of law urged by the appellants.

The second case involves a dispute over the use of ecologically fragile land for non-forest activities. The appellants argue that they should be allowed to transport raw materials to their crusher unit and remove the final product, while the government argues that no non-forest activity can be permitted in ecologically fragile land. The court notes that the ultimate decision in the case will have a direct bearing on appeals filed under the Act of 2003, which are pending. The court denies the appellants' request for interim arrangements, citing the finding by the Tribunal that the crusher unit is situated in the rocky area, which is found to be a part of the land vested under the Act of 2003.

The third case involves a dispute over the use of land deemed as a reserve forest under the Act of 2003. The appellants' request to bring in granite boulders and conduct crushing activity in the disputed area cannot be permitted. The court notes that disputes relating to the identity of the property and the right to conduct commercial activity are still pending before the Tribunal, and therefore the civil court has no jurisdiction to consider the matter. The appeal is dismissed and all pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.

In all three cases, the court orders emphasize the importance of following legal provisions and obtaining necessary approvals before engaging in non-forest activities on designated forest land. The court also notes the jurisdictional limitations of civil courts in matters that are still pending before specialized tribunals.
