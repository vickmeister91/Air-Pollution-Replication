The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently granted bail to Shiv Prasad and Sulabh Singh in connection with Forest Crime No. 46048/01 registered by Forest Range Officer, Rukhad Buffer, Pench Tiger Reserve, Department of Forest, Seoni under Sections 9, 39, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution had alleged that the applicants were disposing of the carcass of a female Sambar by burning it after killing it. 

The court allowed the bail application on the ground of parity, as co-accused Yashwant Salame had already been granted bail. The applicants were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one solvent surety in the like amount. 

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

The Act has been amended several times to strengthen its provisions and to address emerging issues related to wildlife conservation. The penalties for offences under the Act have also been increased to deter people from engaging in activities that harm wildlife.

In this case, the applicants were accused of killing a female Sambar and disposing of its carcass by burning it. The Sambar is a large deer species found in the Indian subcontinent and is protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Killing or hunting a Sambar is a punishable offence under the Act.

The court granted bail to the applicants on the ground of parity, as co-accused Yashwant Salame had already been granted bail. The principle of parity is based on the idea that similarly situated individuals should be treated equally under the law. If one accused has been granted bail, then others who are similarly situated should also be granted bail.

The applicants were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one solvent surety in the like amount. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused to appear before the court as and when required. A solvent surety is a person who guarantees to pay the bail amount if the accused fails to appear before the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is significant as it highlights the importance of the principle of parity in the administration of justice. The principle of parity ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated equally under the law and that there is no discrimination in the application of the law.

In conclusion, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh's decision to grant bail to Shiv Prasad and Sulabh Singh in connection with Forest Crime No. 46048/01 registered by Forest Range Officer, Rukhad Buffer, Pench Tiger Reserve, Department of Forest, Seoni under Sections 9, 39, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a significant development in the administration of justice.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto.
