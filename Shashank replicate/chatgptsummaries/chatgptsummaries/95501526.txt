The court order pertains to two petitions filed by the Management Committee of Ramjas Foundation against the Delhi School Tribunal's judgment in favor of respondent No.1. The petitioners argued that respondent No.1 was not entitled to pay for the period he was suspended and that the Tribunal failed to appreciate the gravity of charges against him. The court noted that the petitioners had failed to appear on several occasions and dismissed the petition. However, on a subsequent application for restoration, the court directed the petitions to be restored.

The petitioners argued that the Tribunal had violated principles of natural justice, but the court held that not every violation of natural justice automatically vitiates an enquiry. The court cited precedents to argue that the complaint of violation of procedural provisions should be examined from the point of view of justice and whether such violation has prejudiced the delinquent officer/employee in defending himself properly and effectively.

The court order discusses exceptions to the principle that breach of natural justice is in itself prejudice. One exception is if only one conclusion is possible based on admitted or indisputable facts. The court also notes the "useless formality" theory, which is an exception to the principle, and discusses the divergent views on its application. The court then applies these principles to a specific case and finds that no evidence was recorded and the principles of natural justice were not followed, resulting in the denial of an opportunity to the respondents. The court dismisses the petitions and makes no order as to costs.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of natural justice in administrative proceedings. Natural justice is a fundamental principle of law that requires that all parties to a dispute be given a fair hearing and an opportunity to present their case. The principle of natural justice is based on the idea that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.

The court cites precedents to argue that the complaint of violation of procedural provisions should be examined from the point of view of justice and whether such violation has prejudiced the delinquent officer/employee in defending himself properly and effectively.

The theory suggests that if a procedural requirement is a mere formality and does not affect the outcome of the case, then a violation of that requirement does not necessarily result in prejudice to the party affected. The court notes that there are divergent views on the application of this theory.

The court then applies these principles to a specific case and finds that no evidence was recorded and the principles of natural justice were not followed, resulting in the denial of an opportunity to the respondents. The court dismisses the petitions and makes no order as to costs.
