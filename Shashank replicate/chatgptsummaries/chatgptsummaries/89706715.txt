In this court order, the case at hand was a motor accident claim appeal. The driver of a vehicle had appealed against an award of compensation to an injured pedestrian. The court found that the driver was at fault for the accident and that the owner of the vehicle had failed to obtain proper insurance. As a result, the court modified the judgment of the trial court to hold the owner and the government liable for the compensation awarded.

The case began with an accident involving a pedestrian and a vehicle. The pedestrian was injured and filed a claim for compensation. The trial court found in favor of the pedestrian and awarded compensation. However, the driver of the vehicle appealed the decision, arguing that he was not at fault for the accident.

Upon review, the court found that the driver was indeed at fault for the accident. The court noted that the driver had failed to exercise proper care and caution while driving, which led to the accident. As a result, the court upheld the trial court's decision to award compensation to the injured pedestrian.

However, the court also found that the owner of the vehicle had failed to obtain proper insurance. This meant that the injured pedestrian would not be able to receive full compensation for their injuries. To address this issue, the court modified the judgment of the trial court to hold the owner of the vehicle liable for the compensation awarded.

In addition to holding the owner of the vehicle liable, the court also held the government liable for the compensation awarded. The court noted that the government had failed to enforce laws and regulations related to insurance requirements for vehicles. As a result, the court found that the government shared responsibility for the accident and the resulting compensation.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of proper insurance and responsible driving. It also serves as a reminder that individuals and governments alike have a responsibility to ensure that laws and regulations related to driving and insurance are enforced. By holding both the owner of the vehicle and the government liable for the compensation awarded, the court has sent a clear message that negligence and non-compliance will not be tolerated.
