B. No. 494, Tehsil and District Hoshiarpur as per jamabandi for the year 1994-95.

The plaintiff claimed that the land was purchased by him and that the notification under Land Preservation Act, 1970 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was not applicable to the land in dispute. The defendants claimed that the suit land along with the adjoining area is hilly area with undulation terrain having a number of standing trees and other growth is undoubtedly and explicitly a forest in the dictionary.

The court decreed the suit filed by the plaintiff as the land in dispute was under cultivation prior to the coming into force of the notification and further that the construction was raised prior to the issuance of corrigendum dated 5.11.1997. The appeal filed by the State was dismissed by the learned lower appellate Court by observing that the notification would have a perspective effect and, therefore, would not apply to the land under cultivation or under construction prior to the issuance of corrigendum.

The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant contends that the notification would have a retrospective effect and, therefore, the suit of the plaintiff should have been dismissed as the construction raised or cultivation undertaken by him was contrary to notification under Land Preservation Act, 1970 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court dismissed the appeal.

The case revolves around a dispute over land measuring 2 Kanal 1 Marla bearing Khewat No. 44, 425, Khatauni No. 473, 452, Khasra Nos. 977 and 971 measuring 22 Kanals 8 Marlas and 2 Kanals 3 Marlas respectively situated in village Chohal, H. B. No. 494, Tehsil and District Hoshiarpur as per jamabandi for the year 1994-95. The plaintiff filed a suit seeking a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from demolishing the tubewell and other construction over the land. The plaintiff claimed that the land was purchased by him and that the notification under Land Preservation Act, 1970 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was not applicable to the land in dispute.

The defendants, on the other hand, claimed that the suit land along with the adjoining area is a hilly area with undulation terrain having a number of standing trees and other growth is undoubtedly and explicitly a forest in the dictionary. The court decreed the suit filed by the plaintiff as the land in dispute was under cultivation prior to the coming into force of the notification and further that the construction was raised prior to the issuance of corrigendum dated 5.11.1997.

The appeal filed by the State was dismissed by the learned lower appellate Court by observing that the notification would have a perspective effect and, therefore, would not apply to the land under cultivation or under construction prior to the issuance of corrigendum. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant contends that the notification would have a retrospective effect and, therefore, the suit of the plaintiff should have been dismissed as the construction raised or cultivation undertaken by him was contrary to notification under Land Preservation Act, 1970 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the notification would have a perspective effect and, therefore, would not apply to the land under cultivation or under construction prior to the issuance of corrigendum. The court further held that the land in dispute was under cultivation prior to the coming into force of the notification and that the construction was raised prior to the issuance of corrigendum dated 5.11.1997. Therefore, the court decreed the suit filed by the plaintiff.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of notifications issued under various laws. The notification under Land Preservation Act, 1970 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was a bone of contention in this case. The defendants claimed that the land in dispute was a forest and, therefore, the notification applied to it. The plaintiff, on the other hand, claimed that the land was not a forest and, therefore, the notification did not apply to it.

The court had to examine the evidence presented by both parties to determine whether the land in dispute was a forest or not. The court held that the land in dispute was not a forest and, therefore, the notification did not apply to it. The court also held that the construction was raised prior to the issuance of corrigendum dated 5.11.1997 and, therefore, the notification would not apply to it even if the land was a forest.

The case also highlights the importance of understanding the retrospective and perspective effect of notifications. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant contended that the notification would have a retrospective effect and, therefore, the suit of the plaintiff should have been dismissed as the construction raised or cultivation undertaken by him was contrary to notification under Land Preservation Act
