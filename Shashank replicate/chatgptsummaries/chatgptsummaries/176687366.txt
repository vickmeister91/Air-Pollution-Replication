The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ petition that challenged the grant of a license under Section 233 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act to establish an industrial unit. The petitioners claimed that the proposed industry would be a source of nuisance and sought to set aside the license. However, the court held that the petitioners had a statutory remedy by way of an appeal to the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions, Thiruvananthapuram, and that the petitioner was not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in the writ petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had not exhausted their statutory remedies before approaching the court. The court noted that the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act provides for an appeal to the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions against any decision of a panchayat or municipality. The court held that the petitioners should have first approached the Tribunal before approaching the court.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the proposed industry would be a source of nuisance. The court held that the petitioners had failed to establish that the grant of the license was illegal or arbitrary.

The court's decision was based on the principle of exhaustion of remedies, which requires that a petitioner exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. The court held that the petitioners had not exhausted their statutory remedies and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court dismissed the writ petition challenging the grant of a license under Section 233 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act to establish an industrial unit. The court held that the petitioners had a statutory remedy by way of an appeal to the Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions, Thiruvananthapuram, and that the petitioner was not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in the writ petition. The court's decision was based on the principle of exhaustion of remedies and the lack of evidence to support the petitioners' claim that the proposed industry would be a source of nuisance.
