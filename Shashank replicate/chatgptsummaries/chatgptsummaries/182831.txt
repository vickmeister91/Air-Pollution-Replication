The court order pertains to a suit filed by Sunil Madan against Balraj Taneja and another person for specific performance of an agreement for sale of a property in Delhi. The defendants failed to file a written statement despite being given multiple chances, and the court decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiff under Order 8 Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code. 

The defendants appealed to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court, arguing that the decree was unjustified and that the court should have written a judgment stating the reasons for the decree. The court examined the relevant provisions of Order 8 and upheld the High Court's decision to decree the suit under Rule 10. The court also noted that the rule gives the court discretion to either pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit.

The court has the discretion to pronounce judgment against a defendant who fails to file a written statement, or to pass an order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. The court can either pronounce judgment on the basis of the facts set out in the plaint or require the plaintiff to prove any such fact. The court can also pass judgment on admission of facts made by the defendant. However, the court must exercise caution and ensure that there are no disputed questions of fact involved in the case before passing judgment.

The court order discusses the requirements for a court to pass a decree for specific performance in a suit. It states that the court must scrutinize the facts set out in the plaint to ensure that all requirements, especially those indicated in Section 16 of the Specific Relief Act, have been complied with. The court must also ensure that the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform their part of the contract. 

The order then examines a specific case where the plaintiff had entered into an agreement for the sale of property, but there was a dispute over whether the defendants had obtained permission from the Income Tax Department and sent it to the plaintiff. The court ultimately decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiff, but the order criticizes the court's failure to consider all relevant facts and the lack of a concise statement of the case in the judgment.

The court order discusses the definition of a judgment in the Code of Civil Procedure, which requires a concise statement of the case, points for determination, decision, and reasons for the decision. The court must provide a self-contained document that reflects the facts of the case, the controversy, and the process of reasoning leading to the ultimate conclusion. The court must write a judgment even in cases where the written statement has not been filed by the defendants.

The court also discusses the discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution and allows the appeal, sets aside the previous judgments, and remands the case back to the Delhi High Court for a fresh decision.
