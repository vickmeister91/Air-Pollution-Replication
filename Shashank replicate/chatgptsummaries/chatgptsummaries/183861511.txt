In a recent court order in India, the issue of whether the import of mammoth ivory falls under the ban on ivory trade imposed by the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was addressed. The court held that the ban on ivory trade applies to all types of ivory, not just elephant ivory, and that mammoth ivory cannot be distinguished from elephant ivory by the naked eye. This decision has significant implications for the trade of mammoth ivory in India.

The court also discussed the principles of interpreting statutes and the duty of the court to make sense of them, even if the language used is imprecise. The court emphasized that the aim should be to give effect to the intention of the legislature and avoid reducing the legislation to futility. The court may reject a narrow interpretation if it defeats the purpose of the law. This is particularly relevant in cases involving economic crimes and contraband.

The court order highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with the intention of the legislature. The court emphasized that a strict construction of penal statutes may not always be given effect to and that a statute must be construed as a workable instrument. This means that the court must take into account the purpose of the law and the context in which it was enacted.

In the case of the ban on ivory trade, the court held that the purpose of the law was to protect wildlife and prevent the trade in ivory. The court noted that mammoth ivory is often used as a substitute for elephant ivory and that allowing its trade would undermine the purpose of the law. The court also noted that mammoth ivory cannot be distinguished from elephant ivory by the naked eye, making it difficult to enforce the ban on ivory trade if mammoth ivory was exempted.

The court's decision has significant implications for the trade of mammoth ivory in India. The decision means that the import of mammoth ivory is prohibited under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. This decision is likely to have an impact on the trade of mammoth ivory in India, as it will make it more difficult for traders to import and sell mammoth ivory.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with the intention of the legislature. The court emphasized that the aim should be to give effect to the purpose of the law and avoid reducing it to futility. This is particularly relevant in cases involving economic crimes and contraband, where a narrow interpretation of the law may defeat its purpose.

In conclusion, the recent court order in India regarding the import of mammoth ivory highlights the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with the intention of the legislature. The court held that the ban on ivory trade applies to all types of ivory, not just elephant ivory, and that mammoth ivory cannot be distinguished from elephant ivory by the naked eye. The court's decision is likely to have an impact on the trade of mammoth ivory in India, as it will make it more difficult for traders to import and sell mammoth ivory. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutes in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of the law and avoiding a narrow interpretation that defeats its purpose.
