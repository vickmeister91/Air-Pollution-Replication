The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two writ petitions. The first writ petition sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to consider the petitioner's objections and safeguard the 'Mambalathuraiyaru' Dam in the interest of the general public and farmers. The second writ petition challenged the order of the District Collector granting mining license to S. Radhakrishnan for a period of five years. The petitioner in the second writ petition raised several issues, including the quarrying site's proximity to Vellimalai Reserve Forest and Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, the quarrying site's location near the tail end of the Western Ghats, and the quarrying site's location within 300 meters of an inhabited site.

The court heard arguments from all parties and took into account the reports submitted by the Advocate Commissioners appointed by the court. The court order stated that the maximum vibration level and sound pressure level recorded during blasting operations were within statutory limits, and that flying fragments and smoke emissions were minimal. However, the District Collector's counter filed in court did not address the need for environmental clearance and impact assessment.

An advocate was appointed to inspect the site and found that the quarry was located in an ecologically sensitive area without the necessary clearances. The court quashed the mining license granted to the respondent and directed the authorities to process the petitioner's application for a No Objection Certificate to establish a college.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental clearances and impact assessments before granting mining licenses. The court's decision to quash the mining license granted to the respondent is a step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that mining activities do not harm the ecosystem.

The court's decision also takes into account the concerns raised by the petitioner regarding the quarrying site's proximity to Vellimalai Reserve Forest and Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, the quarrying site's location near the tail end of the Western Ghats, and the quarrying site's location within 300 meters of an inhabited site. These concerns are valid as mining activities can have a significant impact on the environment and the ecosystem.

The court's decision to direct the authorities to process the petitioner's application for a No Objection Certificate to establish a college is also significant. It shows that the court is committed to ensuring that the interests of the general public and farmers are safeguarded. The court's decision will also help in promoting education and providing opportunities for the youth in the region.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that mining activities do not harm the ecosystem. The court's decision to quash the mining license granted to the respondent and direct the authorities to process the petitioner's application for a No Objection Certificate to establish a college is a step towards promoting education and providing opportunities for the youth in the region. The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental clearances and impact assessments before granting mining licenses.
