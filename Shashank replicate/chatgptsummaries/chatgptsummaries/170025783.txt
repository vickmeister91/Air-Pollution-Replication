In a recent court order, the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Paryavaran Vikas Foundation Trust against the State of Gujarat was dismissed. The court stated that there are alternative remedies available under sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore the PIL was not necessary.

The PIL was filed by the Paryavaran Vikas Foundation Trust, which is a non-governmental organization that works towards environmental conservation and protection. The Trust had filed the PIL against the State of Gujarat, alleging that the state government had failed to take adequate measures to prevent pollution and protect the environment.

The Trust had argued that the state government had not taken sufficient steps to control air pollution, water pollution, and noise pollution. The Trust had also alleged that the state government had failed to implement the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

However, the court dismissed the PIL, stating that there are alternative remedies available under sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Section 14 of the Act provides for the establishment of the National Green Tribunal, which is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes. Section 15 of the Act provides for the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal, which includes the power to hear and dispose of cases related to environmental protection and conservation.

The court held that since the National Green Tribunal has the power to hear and dispose of cases related to environmental protection and conservation, the PIL filed by the Trust was not necessary. The court also noted that the Trust had not exhausted the remedies available under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, before filing the PIL.

The court's decision to dismiss the PIL has been met with mixed reactions. Some environmental activists have criticized the decision, stating that it sends a message that the judiciary is not willing to take a strong stance on environmental issues. Others have welcomed the decision, stating that it reinforces the importance of the National Green Tribunal and encourages litigants to use the remedies available under the Act.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the PIL filed by the Paryavaran Vikas Foundation Trust against the State of Gujarat highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, in addressing environmental issues. The Act provides for a specialized court that has the power to hear and dispose of cases related to environmental protection and conservation, and litigants are encouraged to use the remedies available under the Act before resorting to PILs.
