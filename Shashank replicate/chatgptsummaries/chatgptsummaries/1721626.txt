The court order in question pertains to a case where M/s M.V.Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. had its consent withdrawn by the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner in this case is willing to file an appeal under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, against the impugned order, provided the petitioner is protected against any such appeal being dismissed on the ground of limitation. 

The court observes that the order impugned in this petition is appealable under Section 28 of the Act, and an appeal can be filed within 30 days of the impugned order being communicated to the aggrieved party. The petitioner can file an application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal in terms of the proviso to Section 28(1) of the Act. 

The court dismisses the writ petition and reserves liberty to the petitioner to seek appropriate redress before the appellate authority. This means that the petitioner can still file an appeal against the impugned order, but they must do so within 30 days of the order being communicated to them. If they fail to do so within this time frame, they can file an application for condonation of delay, which may allow them to file the appeal after the 30-day period has elapsed.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a piece of legislation that was enacted to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of Pollution Control Boards at the central and state levels, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides for the establishment of appellate authorities, which can hear appeals against orders passed by the Pollution Control Boards.

In this case, the Pollution Control Board had withdrawn the consent of M/s M.V.Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. The petitioner in this case was aggrieved by this decision and wanted to file an appeal against it. However, they were concerned that their appeal may be dismissed on the ground of limitation, as they may not be able to file the appeal within the 30-day period prescribed by the Act.

The court, in its order, clarified that the petitioner can file an appeal against the impugned order within 30 days of the order being communicated to them. If they are unable to do so within this time frame, they can file an application for condonation of delay, which may allow them to file the appeal after the 30-day period has elapsed. The court also dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner, but reserved liberty to them to seek appropriate redress before the appellate authority.

This court order highlights the importance of complying with the time limits prescribed by the law. It also emphasizes the role of appellate authorities in providing a mechanism for redressal of grievances against orders passed by administrative bodies such as the Pollution Control Board. The order also provides clarity on the procedure for filing appeals and seeking condonation of delay, which can be useful for other parties who may find themselves in a similar situation.
