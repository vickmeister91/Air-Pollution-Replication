The court order in question pertains to a case involving Basant Narayan Singh, who is apprehending his arrest in connection with a case registered for the offences under Sections 37, 38(d) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Singh had requested for bail in the event of his arrest, which was rejected by the Sessions Judge, Patna. Subsequently, Singh filed a petition for bail, which was also rejected by the court due to an unsatisfactory explanation for the delay in filing the petition.

The case against Singh is related to environmental pollution, which is a serious issue that affects the health and well-being of people and the environment. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are two important pieces of legislation that aim to prevent and control pollution in India. These Acts provide for the regulation of industries and other activities that may cause pollution, and also prescribe penalties for non-compliance.

In this case, Singh is accused of violating these Acts, and the court has deemed it necessary to take action against him. However, Singh has sought bail in order to avoid arrest and detention. The court has considered his request for bail, but has rejected it on two occasions.

The first time Singh requested bail, it was rejected by the Sessions Judge, Patna. The reasons for this rejection are not clear from the available information. However, it is likely that the judge considered the seriousness of the charges against Singh and the potential harm that could be caused by his release on bail.

Subsequently, Singh filed a petition for bail in a higher court. However, this petition was also rejected by the court. The reason for this rejection was the unsatisfactory explanation provided by Singh for the delay in filing the petition. It is not clear what the nature of this delay was, but it appears that the court was not satisfied with the explanation provided by Singh.

The rejection of Singh's petition for bail means that he will have to remain in custody until his trial is completed. This is a significant setback for Singh, as it means that he will not be able to go about his normal life until the case against him is resolved. It also highlights the seriousness with which the court views environmental pollution, and the importance of complying with the relevant laws and regulations.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case involving Basant Narayan Singh, who is accused of violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Singh had requested bail in order to avoid arrest and detention, but his request was rejected by the Sessions Judge, Patna, and subsequently by a higher court. The reasons for these rejections are not clear, but it appears that the court was not satisfied with Singh's explanation for the delay in filing his petition for bail. The rejection of Singh's petition means that he will have to remain in custody until his trial is completed, highlighting the seriousness with which the court views environmental pollution and the importance of complying with relevant laws and regulations.
