The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Kaverisene, an NGO, challenging the constitutionality of the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010. The petition was filed against Power Grid Corporation of India and various government bodies. The court noted that the order had already been affirmed by the Supreme Court of India and that the writ petitioners were not parties to the proceeding. The court also observed that the National Green Tribunal Act provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court of India against the order in question.

The National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the appointment of a Chairperson and other Members of the Tribunal, who shall be persons of ability, integrity and standing and have special knowledge or professional experience in the field of environment and related subjects.

The Act also provides for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which includes hearing and disposing of cases relating to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, including the right to clean air, water, and soil, and the right to a healthy environment. The Tribunal has the power to issue orders and directions for the prevention and control of environmental pollution, and for the restoration of the environment.

The writ petition filed by Kaverisene challenged the constitutionality of the National Green Tribunal Act on the grounds that it is opposed to the basic structure of the Constitution. The petitioners argued that the Act violates the principle of separation of powers, as it confers judicial powers on a body that is not a court established under the Constitution. The petitioners also contended that the Act violates the principle of independence of the judiciary, as the Chairperson and Members of the Tribunal are appointed by the government.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, citing that the order had already been affirmed by the Supreme Court of India and that the writ petitioners were not parties to the proceeding. The court also noted that the National Green Tribunal Act provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court of India against the order in question.

The National Green Tribunal has been instrumental in the protection and conservation of the environment in India. The Tribunal has heard and disposed of several cases relating to environmental pollution, including cases relating to air pollution, water pollution, and waste management. The Tribunal has also issued orders and directions for the prevention and control of environmental pollution, and for the restoration of the environment.

The Tribunal has been criticized by some for its perceived lack of independence and for its slow disposal of cases. However, the Tribunal has also been praised for its efforts in protecting the environment and for its role in raising awareness about environmental issues.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's dismissal of the writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 reaffirms the importance of the Tribunal in the protection and conservation of the environment in India. While there may be concerns about the independence and efficiency of the Tribunal, it is clear that the Tribunal has played a crucial role in addressing environmental issues in the country. The Act provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court of India against the order in question, which ensures that the decisions of the Tribunal are subject to judicial review.
