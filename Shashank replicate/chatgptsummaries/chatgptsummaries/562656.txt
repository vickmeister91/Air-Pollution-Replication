Tata Sons Limited, a multinational conglomerate, has filed several court cases against Greenpeace International and Greenpeace India for using the TATA trademark and T device without permission. The first case pertains to an online game titled "Turtle Vs. TATA," which the plaintiff claims defames the company and seeks a permanent injunction and damages of Rs. 10 crores. The plaintiff has established its proprietorship of the TATA trademark due to prior adoption, long continuous and extensive use, and advertising, and the consequent reputation accruing to it. The court has the power to issue a temporary injunction if the words used or facts relied on by the defendant are false.

In the second case, Tata Sons has filed a defamation case against Greenpeace India for making defamatory statements about the Dhamra Port Project. The court is scrutinizing whether the defendant was actuated by malice and whether a temporary injunction is appropriate. The plaintiff argues that the right to free speech cannot be construed as a license to publish defamatory matter. The plaintiff also argues that the use of the Tata mark and T device, although not in the course of trade, will amount to trademark infringement of dilution or tarnishment. Greenpeace India alleges that the present suit is a strategic Lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP suits), intended to silence, censor, and intimidate the answering defendant and other third parties. The defendants say that the port's ongoing expansion work endangers the surrounding mangrove forests and the wildlife, particularly the endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtles.

The third case concerns a game created by Greenpeace India called "Turtles v. Tata," which allegedly defames the company and infringes on its trademarks. Greenpeace India argues that the game is a form of peaceful protest against the construction of the Dhamra Port, which they claim poses a threat to the Olive Ridley Sea Turtles and the environment. The court must determine whether the game constitutes defamation or trademark infringement, or whether it is protected under the right to free speech and expression. Greenpeace India argues that the game is a form of fair criticism and comment on a matter of public concern, and that the use of the TATA marks is not for profit or ridicule but to focus public attention on the impact of the company on the project. The court must also consider whether the case is a SLAPP suit, brought by the plaintiff to stifle criticism of the ecological damage threatened by the Dhamra Port Project.

In the fourth case, the plaintiff claims that the defendant's use of their trademark in a game violated the Trade Marks Act. However, the court found that the defendant's use of the trademark did not constitute a violation as they were not involved in any profit-making endeavor or competitive business with the plaintiff. The court also considered the defendant's argument that they can make reasonable comment, ridicule, and parody of the registered trademarks. The court ultimately balanced free speech and trade mark protection in its decision.

The fifth case discusses the balancing of free speech and trademark protection in cases involving parody or criticism of a trademark. The court emphasizes that the evaluation should be based on the specific context and impact of the parody, and that the fact that it has a commercial element should not be determinative. The court also considers factors such as the medium and context of the use, and whether the parody is primarily communicative or commercial. The court cites examples of cases where the use of a trademark in a critical or parodic manner did not constitute infringement. Ultimately, the court's role is to protect free speech while also respecting trademark rights.

In the sixth case, the court discusses the issue of granting an interlocutory injunction to restrain publication of confidential information or fair comment. The court states that if there is a legitimate ground for supposing that it is in the public interest for the information to be disclosed, the courts should not restrain it by an interlocutory injunction. The court also discusses the plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation and the difficulty in establishing and awarding such damages. The court cites previous cases and precedents to support its decision not to grant an injunction in this case. The court also discusses the use of hyperbole and exaggerated forms of speech in defamation cases and how they do not necessarily entitle a plaintiff to an injunction.

In the seventh case, the court weighs the arguments of both parties and notes that a statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern which does not contain a provably false factual connotation will receive full constitutional protection. The court also discusses the impact of internet publication on defamation cases and notes that while internet publication has wider viewership and greater accessibility, it does not call for a different standard for granting injunctions. The court also addresses the plaintiff's claim that the defendant's use of the TATA logo in their game violates the Trade Marks Act 1999.

In all these cases, the court has to balance the right to free speech and expression with the protection of trademark rights and the prevention of defamation. The court has to consider the specific context and impact of the use of trademarks and the medium and context of the use. The court also has to determine whether the case is a SLAPP suit, brought by the plaintiff to stifle criticism of the ecological damage threatened by the Dhamra Port Project. Ultimately, the court's role is to protect free speech while also respecting trademark rights and preventing defamation.
