The court order pertains to the collection of service charges by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO) for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued a notification in 1999, stating that coal or lignite-based thermal power plants must supply fly ash free of cost to manufacturers of ash-based products, including bricks, blocks, and tiles. This notification was amended in 2003 and 2009, but the intention to supply fly ash free of charge remained unchanged.

The court ruled that TANGEDCO is not entitled to collect any amount, even under the guise of service charge, as per the notification. The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and conserving topsoil. The court order mandates that 20% of dry ESP fly ash should be given free of charge to manufacturers of fly ash or clay ash bricks, blocks, and tiles on a priority basis over other users. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had violated this notification by entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with an exporter. The court directs the Board to implement the notification in its letter and spirit and not let commercial interest come in the way of fulfilling the social objective.

The order also states that the collection of service charge for the supply of fly ash is without approval from the Union of India and that the Union of India has to decide whether the service charge can be collected. The respondents are not entitled to collect service charge without approval from the Union of India. The Union of India has to decide whether service charge can be collected for the supply of fly ash, and if a decision is made against the respondents, the amount collected by way of service charges should be refunded. The court order is final and binding on the parties.

The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had requested permission to collect service charges, but the Ministry of Environment and Forest denied permission and directed the Board to comply with the Fly Ash Utilisation Amendment Notification. The court finds that the writ petition is not maintainable and barred by the principle of estoppel. The court also finds that the earlier order passed by the Division Bench has become final and conclusive between the parties. The court further states that the doctrine of res judicata is applicable to writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court also finds that the supply of 20% of fly ash free of cost does not run counter to the objects of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 has the overriding effect on The Electricity Act, in view of power conferred under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court also states that the Electricity Act 2003 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are operating on two different fields with different objects and reasons. The court refers to previous cases and rules of interpretation of statutes to support its decision.

The court order states that the state has the power to make laws for the collection of fees in matters listed in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The state or state-controlled agencies can charge a reasonable amount for services rendered for the implementation of a Central Act. The court also ruled that the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO) cannot collect service charges from brick manufacturers for the supply of fly ash, as it is the TANGEDCO's mandatory obligation to collect and dispose of fly ash to prevent pollution. The court upheld the Union of India's notification prohibiting the collection of charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers. The TANGEDCO cannot pass on the expenses to consumers as it is not related to generating thermal power.

In summary, the court order prohibits TANGEDCO from collecting service charges for the supply of fly ash to brick manufacturers, as it is the mandatory obligation of TANGEDCO to collect and dispose of fly ash to prevent pollution. The court also upholds the Union of India's notification that fly ash should be supplied free of cost to manufacturers of ash-based products, including bricks, blocks, and tiles. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and conserving topsoil and directs the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to implement the notification in its letter and spirit. The court order is final and binding on the parties, and the respondents are not entitled to collect service charge without approval from the Union of India.
