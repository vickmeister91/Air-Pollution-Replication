The court order in question pertains to 46 petitions filed by drivers who were terminated from their jobs at the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation. The drivers claimed that their termination was an unfair labor practice, while the corporation argued that it was due to excess appointments made by the Divisional Controller. The court found that the termination was done with undue haste and in disregard of principles of natural justice, and that there was no evidence of collusion between the drivers and the corporation's officers.

The court order also discusses the interpretation of Item 1 of Schedule IV of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act. The court examines various clauses in Item 1 of Schedule IV of the Act and concludes that even simpliciter discharge orders passed with undue haste can constitute an unfair labor practice.

The court further discusses the interpretation of the term "discharge" in service jurisprudence and how it can include both punitive and non-punitive discharge orders. The court finds that the petitioner in this case did not act reasonably, fairly, or justly in terminating the services of the respondents without following principles of natural justice.

The court dismisses the writ petitions and grants a stay for six weeks to enable the petitioner to challenge the judgment and order.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following principles of natural justice in employment termination cases. The court found that the termination of the drivers was done with undue haste and without proper consideration of the evidence, which constituted an unfair labor practice.

The court's interpretation of Item 1 of Schedule IV of the Act is also significant, as it clarifies that even simpliciter discharge orders passed with undue haste can be considered an unfair labor practice. This interpretation provides greater protection to employees against arbitrary termination.

The court's discussion of the term "discharge" in service jurisprudence is also noteworthy, as it highlights the broad scope of the term and its potential to include both punitive and non-punitive discharge orders. This interpretation provides greater clarity to employers and employees alike regarding the consequences of termination.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as an important reminder of the need to follow principles of natural justice in employment termination cases and provides greater protection to employees against unfair labor practices.
