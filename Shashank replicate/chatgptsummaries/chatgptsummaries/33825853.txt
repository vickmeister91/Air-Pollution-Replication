The court order is significant because it highlights the importance of proper waste management in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, were introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to regulate the management of solid waste in the country.

The plan must be in line with the requirements of the rules and must ensure that waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner.
