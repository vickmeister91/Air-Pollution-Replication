The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order in a Criminal Misc. Petition filed by Subhash Chand Jain against the State of Rajasthan. The petitioner had sought to quash criminal proceedings against him for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found that cognizance for an offence punishable under the Act can only be taken by the court on the complaint of certain officers or persons, and as such, the cognizance taken against the petitioner was without jurisdiction and void ab-initio. 

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act is aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats, and provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas. It also lays down provisions for the conservation of wildlife and the prevention of hunting, poaching, and other illegal activities.

In this case, the court found that the cognizance taken against the petitioner was without jurisdiction as it was not based on a complaint filed by a competent officer or person. The court noted that Section 55 of the Act provides that cognizance of an offence under the Act can only be taken by a court on a complaint made by the Director of Wildlife Preservation, the Chief Wildlife Warden, or any other officer authorized by the state government in this behalf. 

The court also observed that the provisions of the Act are mandatory in nature and must be strictly followed. It noted that the Act provides for a specific procedure for the initiation of criminal proceedings, and any deviation from this procedure would render the proceedings void ab-initio. The court held that the cognizance taken against the petitioner was without jurisdiction and quashed all subsequent criminal proceedings taken thereunder.

However, the court also gave the prosecution the option to file a complaint by a competent officer in accordance with the Act. This means that the prosecution can still pursue the case against the petitioner, but only if it follows the due process laid down in the Act. The court's order thus serves as a reminder to all concerned that the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 must be strictly adhered to, and any deviation from the same would render the proceedings void ab-initio.

In conclusion, the court order in the Criminal Misc. Petition filed by Subhash Chand Jain against the State of Rajasthan highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court's decision to quash the criminal proceedings against the petitioner for offences under the Act serves as a reminder that the provisions of the Act are mandatory in nature and must be strictly followed. The court's order also gives the prosecution the option to file a complaint by a competent officer in accordance with the Act, thus ensuring that the case can still be pursued if due process is followed.
