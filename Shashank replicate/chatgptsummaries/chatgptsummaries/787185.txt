The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Khedut Stones, which challenged the order passed by the District Collector of Junagadh. The order suspended mining of the lease area granted to the petitioners on the grounds that the area of the quarry lease granted to the petitioners is within a 5-kilometer radius of the notification issued for Girnar Wild Life Sanctuary by the competent authority. The District Collector also stated that a necessary no objection certificate must be obtained from the State Government before mining could continue.

The court observed that an appeal under the statute under Rule 38 of Chapter 5 of the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules, 1966 is available against the impugned order of suspending the quarry work. The court further stated that the petitioner is relegated to alternative remedy. As a result, the petition was summarily rejected.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary permissions before engaging in mining activities. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for individuals and companies to exhaust all available legal remedies before seeking relief through writ petitions.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all individuals and companies engaged in mining activities to ensure that they follow all necessary procedures and obtain all required permissions before proceeding with their work. Additionally, the court's decision underscores the importance of exhausting all available legal remedies before seeking relief through writ petitions.
