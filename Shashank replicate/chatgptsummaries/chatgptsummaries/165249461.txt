The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Bhola Ram Meena and Mounideen Kureshi against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners had completed a training program for tourist guides and had applied for a license to work as nature guides in Ranthambore National Park. However, their application was rejected by the Forest Conservation Officer.

The petitioners approached the court seeking relief, and the court directed them to file a representation before the Chief Wild Life Warden with copies of previous orders in similar cases. The Warden was instructed to examine the case and issue a license if the petitioners' case was found to be covered by previous decisions or pass a speaking order within two months.
