The court order pertains to two separate cases involving allegations of construction projects being undertaken without obtaining prior environmental clearance. In the first case, a petition was filed by M/s Gurgaon Recreation Park Ltd. and others seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint alleged that the accused had started construction of a recreational park without obtaining prior environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The petitioners claimed that they had obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate and a No Objection Certificate/consent to establish from pollution angle. 

The court dismissed the petition filed by petitioner No.1 and issued a notice of motion with regard to petitioner No.2 and 3. The court found that the documents produced by the petitioners did not establish that they had obtained the necessary clearances for the construction of the recreational park. The court also noted that the petitioners had not obtained clearance from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, which was a mandatory requirement for the project. The court observed that the petitioners had started construction without obtaining the necessary clearances and had violated the provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. 

In the second case, a criminal complaint was filed against a company for starting a construction project without obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate. The company had obtained the certificate later, and the court found that the allegations in the complaint were vague and did not make out a case against the accused. The court allowed the petition and quashed the criminal complaint and all subsequent proceedings against the accused. 

The court observed that the complaint did not specify the nature of the construction project, the location of the project, or the date on which the project was started. The court noted that the complaint did not contain any details regarding the alleged violation of the provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The court also observed that the complaint did not specify the authority that had issued the Environment Clearance Certificate and the date on which it was issued. 

The court held that the complaint was vague and did not make out a case against the accused. The court noted that the accused had obtained the necessary clearance for the project and had not violated any provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The court observed that the complaint was filed with the intention of harassing the accused and causing them unnecessary inconvenience. 

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of obtaining prior environmental clearance before starting any construction project. The court noted that the provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 were enacted to protect the environment and prevent any damage to it. The court observed that the failure to obtain the necessary clearances before starting a construction project could have serious consequences for the environment and the people living in the vicinity of the project. 

The court also emphasized the need for specificity in complaints filed under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The court noted that vague and general allegations could not form the basis of a criminal complaint and that the complainant must provide specific details regarding the alleged violation of the provisions of the Act. 

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of obtaining prior environmental clearance before starting any construction project and the need for specificity in complaints filed under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The court has sent a strong message that violations of the Act will not be tolerated and that those who violate its provisions will be held accountable.
