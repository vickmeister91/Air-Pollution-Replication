The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Atul Grover under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Third Additional District and Sessions Judge, Jabalpur. The order had confirmed the rejection of an application filed by Grover under Section 91 read with Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. The court found that the lower courts had erred in rejecting the application on the grounds of delay, as the evidence in question was relevant and could be proved through bank accounts. The impugned orders were set aside, and the application filed by Grover was allowed. The trial court was directed to call for the relevant record and witnesses.

The case at hand involves an application filed by Atul Grover under Section 91 read with Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. The application sought to produce certain bank statements as evidence in a criminal case. The trial court had rejected the application on the grounds of delay, and this decision was confirmed by the Third Additional District and Sessions Judge, Jabalpur.

Atul Grover then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, challenging the orders of the lower courts. The High Court found that the lower courts had erred in rejecting the application on the grounds of delay, as the evidence in question was relevant and could be proved through bank accounts.

The High Court noted that the purpose of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is to enable the court to compel the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Similarly, Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in issue.

The High Court observed that the bank statements sought to be produced by Atul Grover were relevant to the case, as they could establish the source of funds used in the alleged crime. The court further noted that the delay in filing the application was not a sufficient ground for rejecting it, as the evidence in question was not within the knowledge of the applicant and could only be obtained from the bank.

The High Court, therefore, set aside the orders of the lower courts and allowed the application filed by Atul Grover. The trial court was directed to call for the relevant record and witnesses, and to proceed with the case in accordance with law.

This court order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of relevant evidence in criminal cases, and emphasizes that delay in filing an application for the production of such evidence is not a sufficient ground for rejection. The order also highlights the powers of the court under Section 91 and Section 311 of the Cr.P.C., and the need for these powers to be exercised in a just and fair manner. Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the fundamental principles of criminal justice, and the importance of upholding these principles in every case.
