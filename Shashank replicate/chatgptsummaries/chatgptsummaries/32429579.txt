The court has recently issued two orders in cases related to construction violations and non-compliance with statutory rules and regulations. The first case pertains to a challenge by Hotel Tokyo House against a notice issued by the H.P. State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had been directed by the court to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable, and to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The petitioner filed the affidavit as directed.

In the second case, the petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that in case the amendment incorporated in the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act is struck down, the petitioner will demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanctioned plans and beyond compoundable limits. The court also ordered the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. The petitioner sought permission to withdraw the writ petition, which was allowed subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs. The court disposed of the case as having been withdrawn.

The court's orders in both cases highlight the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations related to construction and development. The first case emphasizes the need for transparency and adherence to sanctioned plans, while the second case emphasizes the consequences of violating municipal laws and the need for accountability.
