Sections 50 and 51 of the Act provide for penalties for various offences under the Act. Section 50 provides for imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and also with a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees but which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees, for hunting in a sanctuary or national park.

In Thakur's case, he was accused of offences under Sections 2, 9, 39, 44, 49- A, B, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. It is not clear from the court order what specific offence Thakur was accused of committing. However, Thakur's counsel argued that he was innocent and falsely implicated in the case, and that nothing was seized from his possession.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, allowed Thakur's bail application and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court securing his presence before the trial Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial. This means that Thakur will be released from custody on the condition that he appears before the trial court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during the trial.
