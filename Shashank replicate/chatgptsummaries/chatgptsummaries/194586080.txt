The National Green Tribunal issued an order in response to multiple applications regarding the negative impacts of tourism on the ecology and environment of Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the Rohtang Pass area. The order highlights the importance of preserving the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and the primary source of livelihood for residents. The negative impacts of unregulated and heavy tourism include overcrowding, misuse of natural resources, construction of buildings and infrastructure, littering of waste, and other activities associated with tourism. The order emphasizes the need to identify, measure, and evaluate these impacts and manage them effectively. The order also references a report by an Expert Committee that highlights the crucial and strategic role of tourist spots in governing the ecology and atmospheric conditions influencing the local environment and economy of the area.

The court order discusses the negative impact of tourism and vehicular traffic on the environment and ecology of the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh. The report highlights the over-construction, increased vehicular traffic, and associated air pollution, which have led to the deterioration of the snow caps and a fall in the amount of snowfall received by the region. The court order also mentions the adverse impact of heavy tourism on the ecosystem, including the degradation of forests, uncontrolled and unsustainable grazing, soil erosion, siltation of dams and reservoirs, and forest fires. The order emphasizes the need for reducing vehicular traffic and controlling pollution to protect the fragile ecosystem of the region.

The court order emphasizes the fundamental right of citizens to a clean and decent environment, as mandated by the Constitution of India. The court recognizes the importance of trees in hilly areas for environmental protection and soil binding, and warns against indiscriminate deforestation. The court also notes that development and protection of the environment are not enemies, and that a balance must be struck. The right to a clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right, and the state has a duty to provide it. The court has consistently taken the view that the right to life includes the right to a decent environment. The court also recognizes the need for development, but only if it is done sustainably and with stringent safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the environment.
