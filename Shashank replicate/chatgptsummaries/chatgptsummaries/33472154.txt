In the first court order, the case involves the theft of a speed indicator board and the conviction of two accused individuals. The petitioner, Sri Baban, filed a criminal petition against the State Public Prosecutor. The court considers the admissibility of a confession made by one of the accused to an RPF official and the testimony of several witnesses. The court ultimately confirms the conviction of the accused individuals and cites previous legal precedents in its decision.

The case revolves around the theft of a speed indicator board, which was reported missing from a railway station. The investigating officer received information that led to the arrest of two individuals, who were subsequently convicted of the theft. One of the accused had made a confession to an RPF official, which was used as evidence against them.

The court considered the admissibility of the confession and found that it was made voluntarily and was not obtained through coercion or inducement. The court also considered the testimony of several witnesses who had seen the accused individuals in possession of the stolen item. Based on this evidence, the court confirmed the conviction of the accused individuals.

The court cited previous legal precedents to support its decision. It noted that a confession made to a police officer is not admissible as evidence, but a confession made to an RPF official is admissible. The court also noted that the testimony of witnesses can be relied upon if it is consistent and credible.

In the second court order, the case involves the interpretation of Section 27 of the Evidence Act. This section states that if a fact is discovered during a search made on the strength of any information given by a prisoner, it is considered true. However, if the information is merely hearsay, it cannot be relied upon.

The court found that the recovery relied upon by the investigating officer could not be believed and set aside the conviction. The accused is ordered to be released and any fine paid is to be refunded.

The case involves the recovery of stolen property from the accused individual's possession. The investigating officer received information that led to the recovery of the stolen property. The accused individual was subsequently convicted of the theft based on this evidence.

The court considered the admissibility of the evidence and found that the recovery of the stolen property could not be relied upon. The court noted that the recovery was not made on the strength of any information given by the accused individual, but rather on the basis of information received from an anonymous source. The court found that this information was merely hearsay and could not be relied upon.

Based on this finding, the court set aside the conviction of the accused individual and ordered their release. The court also ordered that any fine paid by the accused individual be refunded.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of admissible evidence in criminal cases. The first court order confirms the conviction of the accused individuals based on admissible evidence, while the second court order sets aside the conviction due to the lack of admissible evidence. The court's interpretation of the Evidence Act is also crucial in determining the admissibility of evidence. These court orders serve as a reminder that the rule of law must be upheld and that justice must be served based on credible and admissible evidence.
