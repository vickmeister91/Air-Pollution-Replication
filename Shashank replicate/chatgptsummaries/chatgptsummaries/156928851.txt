The Tribunal found that the issue was identical to a previous case and decided against the Revenue. The Tribunal also decided in favor of the assessee on the second ground and remitted the third ground back to the Assessing Officer for re-consideration. The appeal was allowed for statistical purposes.

The court order pertains to an appeal filed by M/s. Crystal Granite & Marble Pvt. Ltd.
