The case against Md. Nasbulain was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Bihar Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, and the Prevention of Pollution Act. The petitioner was accused of carrying illegal sand in a truck and fleeing upon seeking Police Party. The court granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner on the condition that he furnishes bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad, subject to the condition as laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner was based on the fact that he had not been arrested yet and that he had cooperated with the investigation. The court also took into consideration the fact that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court further noted that the petitioner had a right to seek anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the grant of anticipatory bail to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offence. The section lays down certain conditions that must be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. These conditions include the requirement that the person seeking anticipatory bail must show that he has reason to believe that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offence and that he has cooperated with the investigation. The section also lays down the conditions that must be imposed on the person seeking anticipatory bail, such as the requirement to furnish bail bonds and to cooperate with the investigation.

In the present case, the court found that the petitioner had satisfied the conditions laid down under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore granted him anticipatory bail. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad. The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioner, such as the requirement to cooperate with the investigation and to not tamper with evidence.
