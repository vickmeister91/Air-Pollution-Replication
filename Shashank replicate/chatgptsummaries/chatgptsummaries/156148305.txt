The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner seeking to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track Court, Poonamallee. The petitioner had filed the petition under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking to produce a statement of accounts. However, the Court below dismissed the petition, stating that there was no necessity for the production of the statement of accounts.

The petitioner, dissatisfied with the decision of the Court below, approached the higher court seeking relief. The Court considered the arguments put forth by both parties and examined the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The Court noted that Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers a Court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the Court also observed that the power conferred under Section 91 is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought to produce a statement of accounts. The Court examined the relevance of the statement of accounts to the case and found that it was not necessary for the purposes of the investigation or trial. The Court noted that the petitioner had not provided any explanation as to how the statement of accounts was relevant to the case and had merely sought to produce it as a matter of right.

The Court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the statement of accounts before the Court below and had only sought to do so at the appellate stage. The Court held that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for the production of the statement of accounts and dismissed the petition.

The Court further noted that the dismissal of the Criminal Original Petition also rendered the connected miscellaneous petition moot. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the miscellaneous petition as well.

In conclusion, the Court held that the power conferred under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The Court also emphasized the importance of providing a clear and cogent explanation for the production of any document or thing under Section 91. In the present case, the Court found that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for the production of the statement of accounts and dismissed the petition.
