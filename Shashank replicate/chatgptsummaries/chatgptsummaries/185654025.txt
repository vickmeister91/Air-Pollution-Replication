The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Pragnesh Kantilal Patel, who sought to set aside a notice published by the Gram Panchayat and restrain the state of Gujarat from taking coercive steps against the petitioner's occupation of land and their activity of harvesting prawns on the land. The court found that the land occupied by the petitioner was declared an eco-sensitive zone and the activities of fish prawns by creating artificial ponds could not be permitted. The petition was dismissed, and the interim orders were vacated.

The petitioner, Pragnesh Kantilal Patel, had been occupying land in an eco-sensitive zone and had been engaged in the activity of harvesting prawns by creating artificial ponds. The Gram Panchayat had issued a notice to the petitioner, stating that the activity was illegal and that the petitioner should vacate the land. The petitioner had then filed a petition in the Gujarat High Court, seeking to set aside the notice and restrain the state of Gujarat from taking coercive steps against the petitioner's occupation of the land.

The court found that the land occupied by the petitioner was declared an eco-sensitive zone and that the activities of fish prawns by creating artificial ponds could not be permitted. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained any permission from the authorities to carry out the activity and that the activity was in violation of the law. The court also observed that the activity was causing damage to the environment and that it was not sustainable.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not made any efforts to obtain the necessary permissions from the authorities and that the petitioner had not taken any steps to mitigate the damage caused to the environment. The court observed that the petitioner had been occupying the land illegally and that the activity was causing irreparable damage to the environment.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner and vacated the interim orders. The court directed the petitioner to vacate the land and to stop the activity of harvesting prawns by creating artificial ponds. The court also directed the state of Gujarat to take necessary steps to ensure that the petitioner vacated the land and stopped the activity.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court's decision to dismiss the petition filed by Pragnesh Kantilal Patel is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The court's decision sends a strong message to individuals and entities that engage in activities that are harmful to the environment and that violate the law. The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions from the authorities before engaging in any activity that may have an impact on the environment. Overall, the court's decision is a positive development for the environment and for sustainable development in Gujarat.
