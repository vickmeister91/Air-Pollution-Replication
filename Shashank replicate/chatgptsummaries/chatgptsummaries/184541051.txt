The Madras High Court recently issued a common judgment on three related cases involving Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam, LA Bottlers Private Ltd., and various government entities. The cases involved unauthorized construction of a factory by LA Bottlers and the petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to remove the construction and close the factory. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a ruling on the matter.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the classification of land for a bottling unit owned by L.A. Bottlers Private Ltd. The company had purchased land classified as "Mixed Residential Zone" and applied for reclassification to "Controlled Industrial Zone" to set up the bottling unit. The application was rejected by the government, citing public resentment and unrest. The company had obtained various permissions and licenses from different authorities, except for the change of land classification. The main grievance against the factory was the drawal of groundwater in large quantities from borewells in an area where agriculture continues to exist, causing apprehensions among the public. The court remitted the matter of reclassification to the government for fresh consideration after evaluating public perception vis-a-vis the rule of law.

The court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, regarding the installation of a windmill. The court has disposed of the petition, allowing the seventh respondent to apply for permission from the local body within two weeks. The court also highlights several legal violations by the petitioner company, including unauthorized construction of a factory building, non-renewal of pollution control board consents, and failure to obtain a running license. The court emphasizes the importance of public perception and the need to protect water resources. The government's decision to reject the petitioner company's application for reclassification of land use is upheld.

The court order states that the petitioner company, LA Bottlers Private Limited, did not have the necessary approvals for the construction and installation of their factory. The company also did not have a valid land conversion approval or building plan approval. The court found that the company had circumvented basic statutory provisions to facilitate the construction and installation of the factory and machinery. The court ordered the closure and sealing of the factory and the removal of unauthorized construction. The court also noted that the water table was getting depleted due to the company's usage and that the company's undertaking to not draw water from wells dug by them would not help in the long run.

The court order discusses a dispute over the change of land use for a factory in Suriyur Village. The first respondent/writ petitioner claims that the newly elected seventh respondent has developed animosity towards them and has repeatedly visited the factory demanding that they not draw any ground water without authorization. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has granted consent to the factory, but objections have been raised by the public and the sixth respondent. The court has remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration. The writ petitioners in W.P(MD).Nos.5915 of 2017 and 11718 of 2014 have raised objections to the factory's construction without necessary permission and the depletion of ground water levels. The court has taken note of the objections and materials placed and has upheld the second respondent's decision to reject the application for land use conversion.

The court order discusses the rejection of an application for land use conversion due to concerns about the impact on groundwater levels and agricultural operations. The court considers various objections and statutory provisions and ultimately upholds the rejection. The order also discusses various permissions and certificates granted to the applicant, but notes that these do not confer the right to operate without proper land use conversion approval. The court ultimately denies the appeal and upholds the rejection of the application.

The court order discusses the various permissions and objections related to a factory in Suriyur Village. The first respondent had obtained necessary permissions from various authorities, but objections were raised by some residents and the local body. The court notes that the local body had issued a No Objection Certificate for running the factory and that the first respondent was entitled to presume that the acts done by the local body were in accordance with the law. The court also notes that the Water Resources Department had granted clearance for drawal of groundwater for the factory. The court ultimately concludes that the factory cannot be sealed merely on account of public agitation and law and order problem, and that the Director of Town and Country Planning may accord post-facto approval subject to relevant norms and regulations.

The court order lists the permitted uses for Zone 1(b) Mixed Residential Use Zone, which includes hostels, community halls, clinics, educational institutions, and various types of shops. The order also references the concept of sustainable development and the need to balance environmental protection with industrialization. The court ultimately dismisses a writ appeal and two writ petitions, stating that the project in question is a private commercial venture and not for any public purpose, and that the appellant showed scant respect for the law of the land. The order directs various government officials and entities to take appropriate action.

In summary, the Madras High Court issued a common judgment on three related cases involving Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam, LA Bottlers Private Ltd., and various government entities. The cases involved unauthorized construction of a factory by LA Bottlers and the petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to remove the
