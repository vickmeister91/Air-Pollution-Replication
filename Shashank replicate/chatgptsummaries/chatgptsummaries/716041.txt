The Vadalur Sarvodaya Nagar & Boomidhan Residents Welfare Association filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, requesting the court to issue a writ of mandamus forbidding the respondents from storing and transporting coal from or through Vadalur, Cuddalore District. The petitioner alleged that the operation of the lignite depot at Vadalur resulted in high levels of suspended and respirable particulate matter being generated, causing a high risk of serious human health impacts. The court ordered the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to inspect and submit a report to determine if the activities of the respondents were detrimental to the public in general.

The court order pertains to M/s. Chettinadu Lignite Transport Services (P) Limited in Vadalur, which was issued a consent to establish for the collection, storage, and transportation of 7000 T/Day of lignite. However, frequent public complaints were raised regarding lignite dust pollution, and the unit was issued a show cause notice for operating without the consent to operate of the Board. After complying with the directions and improvement measures suggested by the Board, the unit was inspected and found to have complied with the conditions set forth by the Board. Consent to operate was subsequently issued subject to certain conditions. The order lists the conditions and confirms that the unit has complied with them.

The court order states that the respondents have complied with the recommendations of the TNPC Board to reduce pollution caused by transportation and handling of lignite and noise pollution. The court accepts the report submitted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board that the parameters for SPM, SO2, NOx, and ANL are within the tolerance limit specified for the residential zone. The court also notes that public hearing was made optional since 3.5.1994 and that the company has been functioning for more than 10 years without any objection. The writ petition is disposed of with no order as to costs.
