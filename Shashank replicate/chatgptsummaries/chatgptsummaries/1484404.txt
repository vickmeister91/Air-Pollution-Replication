The court order pertains to multiple petitions filed by various individuals and organizations against the construction of a new Secretariat in Kottuppuram, Chennai.

The court is considering the matter.

The court order discusses the construction of a new Secretariat Complex in Tamil Nadu due to the shortage of space and poor condition of existing buildings. The government identified a suitable site and issued orders for the construction of a new complex, including the Legislative Assembly Hall. Tenders were called for and an architect was selected. The foundation stone was laid, and arrangements were made for the demolition of existing buildings. The order also mentions a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the implementation of draft notifications under the Environment (Protection) Rules.

The court order discusses a draft notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2003, which proposed amendments to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification. The notification sought to bring new construction projects and industrial estates under the purview of the assessment, subject to certain conditions. The court order also mentions two sets of writ petitions, one seeking enforcement of the notification and the other seeking its quashing. The petitioners seeking enforcement argue that the construction of a new Secretariat building would disturb educational institutions and waste public money, while the petitioners seeking quashing argue that the notification is illegal, unconstitutional, ultra vires, and unenforceable.

The court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a new Secretariat complex in Chennai, India. Petitioners opposing the construction argue that it will deplete cash reserves and have negative social and environmental impacts. They also argue that the government did not consult all stakeholders. Petitioners supporting the construction argue that the notification restricting construction only applies to industrial projects and that the government has the right to make policy decisions. The court considers issues of locus standi, justiciability, and the applicability of the notification. Ultimately, the court finds that the government has the right to make policy decisions regarding the location of its Secretariat and that the petitioners opposing the construction do not have standing to challenge the decision.

The court order states that the government has the power to decide the location of the Secretariat and the sufficiency of the present accommodation. The court also emphasizes that PIL jurisdiction should only be invoked for the enforcement of fundamental rights and not for financial or economic decisions taken by the government. The court further states that the construction of the new Secretariat complex may cause temporary discomfort to the neighbors, but it cannot be prohibited as it serves the larger public interest. The court also holds that the proposed amendments creating new obligations can only be prospective in operation. Finally, the court refuses to grant leave to file an appeal under Article 133 of the Constitution of India.
