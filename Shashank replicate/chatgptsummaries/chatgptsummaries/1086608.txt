The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by individuals seeking employment under the Noon Meal Scheme organized by the State Government. The petitioners were seeking employment for candidates recommended by them, and in some cases, challenging the appointment of respondents who were appointed contrary to the choice of the school management. The court referred the matter to a division bench to decide the nature of employment in the Noon Meal Centres and the role of private school management in having a say in the matter of appointment as a constitutional right. The division bench disposed of the matter, stating that the government had issued orders that made the question raised by the learned Single Judge in the reference order unnecessary.

The court order states that private school management does not have the power to appoint noon meal staff and are not governed by the grant in aid code. The government is directly administering both the noon meal program and Anganwadi centers under ICDS, and no power has been delegated to private school managements to select any candidate. The post of noon meal organizer, cook, and assistant cook as well as helpers in the Anganwadi centers are not created by any rule framed under Article 309 of the Constitution, but since the government took over to maintain the entire scheme and had created a separate Ministry for administering the scheme and bearing the entire cost of the scheme, it is a "public employment." The court also refers to previous decisions of the Supreme Court and clarifies that the appointment to the post must be subjected to the touchstone of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The court rejects the stand taken by the State Government and holds that the school management must have a say in the matter of appointment.

The court order states that the appointments made in Noon Meal Centres in minority and non-minority schools may be approved in accordance with a previous court judgment. However, the government argues that appointments should be made according to present government orders. The court ultimately directs the respondents to approve appointments made prior to a certain date, but any appointments made after that date will be governed by the new government order. The court also notes that previous court judgments on the matter have not fully addressed the constitutional issue of appointment and have caused confusion. The court ultimately decides not to disturb current appointments made in accordance with proper procedures.

The court order discusses the principle of natural justice and the need to prove prejudice in addition to a violation of natural justice. The order also addresses a government order that contradicts a previous court decision regarding the appointment of noon meal staff in minority schools. The court directs the state government to withdraw the new order and bring employment in line with the constitutional scheme and previous court decisions. The order dismisses all writ petitions and directs the government to comply with the court's decision within eight weeks. The order is addressed to various government officials for appropriate action and compliance.

In summary, the court order deals with the appointment of noon meal staff in government-run schools and Anganwadi centers. The court clarifies that private school management does not have the power to appoint noon meal staff and that the government is directly administering the program. The court also emphasizes that the appointment to the post must be subjected to the touchstone of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The court directs the state government to withdraw the new order and bring employment in line with the constitutional scheme and previous court decisions. The order dismisses all writ petitions and directs the government to comply with the court's decision within eight weeks.
