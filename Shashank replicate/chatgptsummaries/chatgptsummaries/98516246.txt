The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by M/s Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd against the denial of Cenvat Credit of Rs 1,52,583/- under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules 2004 by the Adjudicating Authority and the first Appellate Authority. The dispute was over whether the services provided by male nurses at the factory and colony of the appellant had any nexus with the manufacturing activity. 

The appellant argued that the services were required to be provided statutorily under the Factories Act and rules made thereunder and were admissible as input credit under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules as services provided in relation to manufacture. The court allowed the appeal, citing case laws that supported the view that Cenvat Credit with respect to medical facilities provided statutorily under the Factories Act 1948 would be admissible.

The Factories Act, 1948, is an act that regulates the working conditions in factories and provides for the health, safety, welfare, and other aspects of the workers employed in factories. The act mandates that factories employing a certain number of workers must provide medical facilities to their employees. The act also provides for the appointment of a qualified medical practitioner or a nurse to attend to the medical needs of the workers.

In the present case, the appellant argued that the services provided by male nurses at the factory and colony of the appellant were required to be provided statutorily under the Factories Act and rules made thereunder. The appellant contended that the services provided by the male nurses were admissible as input credit under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules as services provided in relation to manufacture.

The Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004, provide for the credit of duty paid on inputs and capital goods used in or in relation to the manufacture of final products. Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules defines input service as any service used by a manufacturer, whether directly or indirectly, in or in relation to the manufacture of final products and clearance of final products up to the place of removal.

The Adjudicating Authority and the first Appellate Authority had denied the Cenvat Credit claimed by the appellant on the ground that the services provided by the male nurses did not have any nexus with the manufacturing activity. The authorities had held that the services provided by the male nurses were in the nature of welfare services and were not admissible as input credit under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules.

The appellant challenged the order of the Adjudicating Authority and the first Appellate Authority before the court. The court allowed the appeal and held that the services provided by the male nurses were admissible as input credit under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules. The court relied on the case laws that supported the view that Cenvat Credit with respect to medical facilities provided statutorily under the Factories Act 1948 would be admissible.

The court observed that the services provided by the male nurses were required to be provided statutorily under the Factories Act and rules made thereunder. The court held that the services provided by the male nurses were in relation to the manufacture of final products and were admissible as input credit under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to an appeal filed by M/s Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd against the denial of Cenvat Credit of Rs 1,52,583/- under Rule 2(l) of the Cenvat Credit Rules 2004 by the Adjudicating Authority and the first Appellate Authority.
