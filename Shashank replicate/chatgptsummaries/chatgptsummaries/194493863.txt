The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the illegal transportation and possession of ganja, a type of cannabis. In the first case, two appellants were convicted and sentenced for carrying 78.9 kilograms of ganja illegally. The prosecution presented witnesses and evidence to prove the appellants' guilt, while the defense argued that they were falsely implicated in the case. The court examined the evidence and witness statements and upheld the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellants.

Similarly, in the second case, two individuals were arrested for transporting ganja in a car. The most important witness was a sub-inspector who received information about the transportation and organized a search party. The car was eventually stopped and searched, resulting in the discovery of the ganja. The court found the evidence provided by police witnesses to be reliable and upheld the conviction of the accused.

The third court order pertains to the case of Sena and others v. State of Chhattisgarh, where the prosecution has proved its case against the appellants. The court has observed that the evidence of a police officer cannot be discarded solely on the ground that he is a police officer and interested in the outcome of the case. The court has affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence, and the seized items may be disposed of according to the law and procedure. The appellants, who are reported to be in jail, shall suffer the remaining sentence imposed upon them.

In all three cases, the prosecution presented evidence and witnesses to prove the guilt of the accused, while the defense argued that they were falsely implicated. The courts examined the evidence and witness statements and upheld the convictions and sentences imposed on the appellants. The reliability of police witnesses was also a key factor in these cases, with the courts finding their testimony to be credible and admissible.

The transportation and possession of illegal drugs is a serious offense in India, and the courts have consistently upheld the law in cases involving ganja and other drugs. The penalties for such offenses can be severe, including lengthy prison sentences and fines. It is important for individuals to be aware of the consequences of engaging in such activities and to abide by the law to avoid legal repercussions.
