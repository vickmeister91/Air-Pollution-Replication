In July 2014, the court received a petition from Mahendra Kumar against Ramesh Kumar Jain. The petition was filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. because the applicant/accused was unhappy with the order passed by the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bina, District Sagar, which closed the right of defence of the applicant/accused. The court found that the reasons assigned by the trial court were just and proper, and the application was dismissed.

The case involved Mahendra Kumar and Ramesh Kumar Jain. Mahendra Kumar had filed a petition against Ramesh Kumar Jain under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The reason for the petition was that Mahendra Kumar was unhappy with the order passed by the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bina, District Sagar. The order had closed the right of defence of the applicant/accused. Mahendra Kumar had filed the petition to challenge this order.

The court heard the petition and found that the reasons assigned by the trial court were just and proper. The court dismissed the application. This meant that the order passed by the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bina, District Sagar, which closed the right of defence of the applicant/accused, would stand.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the trial court had given just and proper reasons for closing the right of defence of the applicant/accused. The court found that there was no reason to interfere with the trial court's decision. The court also noted that the applicant/accused had not been able to show any error in the trial court's decision.

Overall, the court's decision was a clear indication that it would not interfere with the decisions of lower courts unless there was a clear error or injustice. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of providing just and proper reasons for decisions, particularly in cases where the right of defence is being closed. This case serves as a reminder to all courts to ensure that they provide clear and justifiable reasons for their decisions.
