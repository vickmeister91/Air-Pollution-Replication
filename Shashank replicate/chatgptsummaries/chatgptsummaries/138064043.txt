The Karnataka High Court recently passed a court order in a criminal revision petition filed by M/S Venkateshwara Brick Works against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners had been convicted for committing an offence under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and had filed an appeal before the Sessions Court. The petitioners had also filed an application for production of copies under Section 391 of Cr.P.C, which was rejected by the Sessions Court. The High Court allowed the revision petition, stating that production of documents should have been allowed by the Sessions Court with liberty to the respondent to contest the same.

The case pertains to an offence committed by the petitioners under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners for operating a brick kiln without obtaining the necessary consent from the Board. The complaint was investigated by the Board, and it was found that the petitioners had indeed operated the brick kiln without obtaining the necessary consent. The petitioners were subsequently convicted by the Magistrate's Court and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000.

The petitioners filed an appeal before the Sessions Court, challenging their conviction. They also filed an application for production of copies under Section 391 of Cr.P.C, seeking copies of the complaint filed by the Board, the investigation report, and other documents related to the case. The Sessions Court rejected the application, stating that the documents were already in the possession of the petitioners and that there was no need to produce them again.

The petitioners then filed a criminal revision petition before the High Court, challenging the order of the Sessions Court. The High Court allowed the revision petition, stating that the Sessions Court should have allowed the production of documents under Section 391 of Cr.P.C. The High Court observed that the production of documents was necessary for the petitioners to effectively challenge their conviction before the Sessions Court. The High Court also observed that the respondent, i.e., the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, should have been given the liberty to contest the production of documents.

The court order passed by the High Court is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the right to access information in criminal proceedings. The right to access information is a fundamental right that is essential for the effective functioning of the criminal justice system. The production of documents is an important aspect of this right, as it enables the accused to effectively challenge the case against them.

The court order also highlights the importance of procedural fairness in criminal proceedings. Procedural fairness requires that all parties to a case be given a fair opportunity to present their case and challenge the case against them. The rejection of the petitioners' application for production of documents by the Sessions Court was a violation of this principle of procedural fairness. The High Court's order rectifies this violation and ensures that the petitioners are given a fair opportunity to challenge their conviction.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the Karnataka High Court in the criminal revision petition filed by M/S Venkateshwara Brick Works against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is a significant step towards ensuring the right to access information and procedural fairness in criminal proceedings. The order reaffirms the importance of the right to access information and highlights the need for procedural fairness in criminal proceedings. The order also serves as a reminder to all courts to uphold these fundamental principles of criminal justice.
