The Rajasthan High Court recently heard a revision petition against the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pali-Marwar, who had discharged the accused non-petitioners of offences under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complaint was filed by the Rajasthan Board for Prevention and Control of Pollution against M/s. Man Processors for disposing of industrial waste without permission and polluting the Bandi river. The Chief Judicial Magistrate discharged the accused due to legal objections, including the lack of a valid sanction for prosecution and the violation of Section 21(3)(b) regarding the division of samples.

The High Court found the order of discharge to be erroneous and stated that if a court finds a sanction for prosecution to be invalid or missing, the proceedings must be dropped instead of discharging the accused. The court also clarified that a sanction for prosecution was not necessary when the complaint was filed by the Board through its Member Secretary. The court order discusses the requirements for taking cognizance of an offense under the Act of 1974. Section 49 of the Act requires the court to take cognizance on a complaint made by the Board or any officer authorized by it, or any person who has given notice of not less than sixty days in the prescribed manner. The court clarifies that no sanction for prosecution is required under Section 49.

The court also notes that the complaint must be filed by the authorities or persons mentioned in Clauses (a) and (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 49. The court sets aside the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and remands the case back to him for proper inquiry into the authority of the Member Secretary to file the complaint. The court directs the Chief Judicial Magistrate to drop the proceedings if the complaint is not filed in accordance with Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 49.
