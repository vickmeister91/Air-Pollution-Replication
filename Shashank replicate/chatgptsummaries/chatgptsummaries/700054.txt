The case involved the dismissal of V. Antony, a former officer of the Bank of Cochin, who had been terminated from his position due to alleged misconduct. Antony had filed a writ petition challenging his dismissal and seeking reinstatement. However, the court held that the Bank of Cochin was not a statutory body and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable.

The court also stated that the order for reinstatement could not be given in this case. The court noted that the Bank of Cochin was a private bank and therefore, the principles of natural justice did not apply to it. The court further held that the bank had followed the proper procedure in dismissing Antony and that there was no reason to interfere with its decision.

In addition to dismissing Antony's writ petition, the court also allowed one writ appeal and dismissed another. The details of these appeals were not provided in the court's order.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the organization or entity being challenged in a writ petition. In this case, the Bank of Cochin was not a statutory body and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable. Additionally, the court's decision underscores the importance of following proper procedures in employment termination cases, even in the absence of statutory requirements.
