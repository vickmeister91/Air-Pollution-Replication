The Gujarat High Court recently granted a draft amendment and heard a case where petitioners sought a declaration that officials of respondent no.2 had no authority to take action against them in the Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The petitioners argued that respondent no.3 and respondent no.4 were the competent authorities for regulating imports/exports and transactions concerning units in the Kandla SEZ. The petitioners also claimed that the detention of their containers by respondent no.2 officials was illegal, arbitrary, and unjust.

The court examined various reports and affidavits and noted that the government notification required scrutiny and testing of plastic waste/scrap before clearance. The court found that the Customs authorities seemed to have been rendered functus officio so far as the matter pertaining to the conduct of a unit situated in SEZ was concerned. The court order states that the Customs authorities have no jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the conduct of a unit situated in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) after the SEZ Act, 2005 came into force.

The court also cited a previous case and stated that the authority issuing a Show Cause Notice must have the proper jurisdiction and cannot usurp power. The case is set to return on February 26, 2009, and ad interim relief is granted subject to compliance with provisions and further orders by the court.
