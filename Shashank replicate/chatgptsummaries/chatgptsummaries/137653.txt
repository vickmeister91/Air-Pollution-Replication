In this court case, the petitioner is seeking to quash and set aside orders that cancelled their admission to a B.Ed. course. The petitioner argues that the orders were passed without notice or hearing and that they were eligible for admission according to the rules. The respondent authorities argue that the petitioner was not eligible for admission and that granting admission would set a precedent for other ineligible candidates. Both parties cite various legal precedents to support their arguments.

The court order states that the court will not interfere in matters of admissions unless the act complained of is clearly beyond jurisdiction or contrary to the statutes, rules or regulations governing the institution, or there is a statutory duty which the authority has failed to perform or the impugned act is mala fide or arbitrary. The petitioner was granted admission by the Committee of the respondent University after conducting inquiries at three different stages, and the respondent authorities cannot take advantage of their own mistake. The decision of cancellation of the admission was taken ex-parte before which date the petitioner had started attending the classes.

The court quashes and sets aside the orders passed by the respondent authorities cancelling the admission of the petitioner in the B.Ed. Course and directs the respondent authorities to consider the case of the petitioner sympathetically and grant admission by creating an additional seat. The respondent authorities are also directed to take appropriate action against the respondent College.
