The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Santosh Dattatray Naik, had been externed from certain Tahsils for a period of two years by the Divisional Commissioner, Nashik Division, Nashik in Externment Appeal No. 34 of 2016. The petitioner had challenged the order on the grounds of violation of principles of natural justice and lack of substance in the appeal. The court heard the case and ruled that the writ petition is heard finally.

The petitioner had denied the allegations made against him and challenged the externment order on the grounds that the crimes were pending and he had not been convicted by any court. The court found that the externment order was excessive and unsustainable in law as there was no justifiable reason to ban entry of the petitioner in other areas where he had not committed any offence. The court quashed and set aside the externment order.

The court observed that the externment order was passed without any material to show that the petitioner was likely to commit any offence in the future. The court further observed that the order was passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard and without considering the relevant material on record. The court held that the order was violative of the principles of natural justice and was therefore unsustainable in law.

The court also noted that the externment order was passed on the basis of allegations made against the petitioner, which were yet to be proved in a court of law. The court held that the mere fact that the petitioner was accused of certain offences did not justify his externment from certain areas. The court observed that the externment order was passed without considering the gravity of the alleged offences and without taking into account the fact that the petitioner had not been convicted by any court.

The court further observed that the externment order was excessive and went beyond the scope of the power conferred on the Divisional Commissioner under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981. The court held that the power to extern a person from certain areas could only be exercised if there was a reasonable apprehension that the person was likely to commit any offence in the future. The court held that in the absence of any material to show that the petitioner was likely to commit any offence in the future, the externment order was unsustainable in law.

In light of the above observations, the court quashed and set aside the externment order passed against the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to the protection of his fundamental rights and that the externment order violated his right to freedom of movement. The court directed the authorities to take necessary steps to ensure that the petitioner was not prevented from entering any area where he had not committed any offence. The court also directed the authorities to expunge the externment order from the records. 

In conclusion, the court order in question highlights the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice and ensuring that the exercise of power by authorities is within the scope of the law. The court's decision to quash and set aside the externment order passed against the petitioner serves as a reminder that the protection of fundamental rights is paramount and that any infringement of these rights must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.
