The Madras High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by P. Periyasamy, President of Pappini Panchayat, Kulathupalayam. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to take action against respondents 5 to 8 for causing air pollution in the process of burning coconut shells in their industry. 

The court noted that all 19 charcoal units, including the four units in question, were not in operation as per the status report filed by the District Environmental Engineer, Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board, Thiruppur North. As a result, the writ petition was disposed of, and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed.

The petitioner had alleged that the respondents were causing air pollution by burning coconut shells in their industry. The petitioner had also claimed that the respondents were not following the guidelines issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and were causing harm to the environment and the health of the people living in the area.

The court noted that the TNPCB had issued guidelines for the operation of charcoal units and that the respondents were required to follow these guidelines. The court also noted that the TNPCB had conducted an inspection of the respondents' units and had found that they were not following the guidelines.

The court observed that the respondents had not denied the allegations made by the petitioner and that they had not produced any evidence to show that they were following the guidelines issued by the TNPCB. The court also noted that the respondents had not produced any evidence to show that they were not causing air pollution.

The court further observed that the respondents had not taken any steps to rectify the situation and that they had not shown any willingness to comply with the guidelines issued by the TNPCB. The court noted that the respondents had not even filed a counter-affidavit to the writ petition.

The court, therefore, directed the respondents to take immediate steps to comply with the guidelines issued by the TNPCB and to take steps to rectify the situation. The court also directed the respondents to file a compliance report within four weeks.

The court noted that if the respondents failed to comply with the directions issued by the court, the petitioner would be at liberty to approach the court again for appropriate relief.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's recent court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by P. Periyasamy, President of Pappini Panchayat, Kulathupalayam, highlights the importance of complying with the guidelines issued by the TNPCB. The court's order serves as a reminder to industries to take steps to protect the environment and the health of the people living in the area. The court's order also emphasizes the need for industries to take responsibility for their actions and to take steps to rectify any harm caused to the environment.
