The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over land ownership and government actions to take over or cancel land grants. In the first case, a partnership firm called Munnar Woods filed a writ petition seeking to quash an order issued by the District Collector of Idukki, Kerala, which ordered the taking over of 2.84 acres of land in Pallivasal Village in Devikulam Taluk along with the constructions thereon by the government. The petitioner claimed that the land was assigned to their predecessor-in-interest under Cardamom Rules (Travancore) of 1935 and a patta was issued under the said Rules. The court heard the case and delivered a judgment on July 25, 2014, directing the restoration of possession of the land to the petitioner based on their title under the Cardamom Rules of 1935. The State appealed the decision, arguing that the learned Judge erred in scrutinizing the title of the petitioner and that the District Collector had to take a decision on the matter.

In the second case, the court discussed the construction of a resort on land that was originally described as a coffee plantation but was later found to be part of a cardamom plantation. The District Collector issued an order to resume the land from the petitioner, citing violations of rules and regulations relating to cardamom cultivation and transfer of land without permission. The petitioner claims to have valid title to the property through successive assignments, but the government argues that there is no proof of payment for the land. The court finds that the petitioner's title can be verified and that the government can establish its own right to the property in separate proceedings.

The third case involves the recovery of instalments due to the government from a land purchaser under the Revenue Recovery Regulations. The court directs the appropriate authorities to recover all remaining instalments due to the government from the purchaser. If the land is assigned to the purchaser and then revoked, they will have no right or interest over any improvements made on the land. If the government requires any portion of the land for constructing a road or pathway, the purchaser must surrender that portion without claiming compensation but will be entitled to a proportionate amount of ground rent. The court also discusses the law regarding resumption of land by the government and the need to observe due process of law.

In the fourth case, the court considers whether the 1935 Cardamom Rules were repealed and concludes that they were. The court finds that there is no statutory provision that enables the District Collector to take over land given for cardamom cultivation alleging violation of the conditions of the grant. The court finds that proper materials relevant to the issue have not been verified, proper hearing was not conducted in the matter, and a hasty decision has been taken without even trying to understand the manner in which the petitioner and their predecessor-in-interest came to be in possession of the land.

Finally, in the fifth case, the court states that authorities must rely on specific provisions of the law before canceling a grant. The conditions of the grant must be looked into before determining if there has been a violation. The petitioner had permission to construct buildings and pay taxes, but the authorities suddenly demolished the structures without proper consideration of the petitioner's rights. The court found that the order was passed in violation of natural justice principles and was highly discriminatory and autocratic. The court also found that the District Collector who passed the order was not personally made a party to the proceedings, so there was no justification for imposing a penalty on him. However, the cost imposed on the appellant was justified and must be paid by the government. The judgment does not preclude the government from taking appropriate action in compliance with the law.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of due process of law and the need for authorities to follow specific provisions of the law before taking action to cancel land grants or take over land. The court also emphasizes the importance of verifying ownership and title to land before making decisions that could have significant impacts on individuals and businesses.
