The National Green Tribunal in Pune heard several applications related to pollution caused by brick kilns and the environmental impacts of operating them without necessary permissions from regulatory bodies. The court issued a common judgment on February 24, 2014. The applications involved several respondents, including the State of Maharashtra and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.

One of the cases pertained to pollution caused by brick kilns operating without necessary permissions from regulatory authorities. The case was brought by Sonyabapu, who sought an injunction against Sitabai for running a brick kiln without valid permission. Sonyabapu alleged that the brick kiln was being operated illegally and in violation of guidelines issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The brick kiln was also causing pollution and endangering the health and lives of nearby residents. The court heard the case on merits and ordered the illegal brick kiln to be shut down to protect the right to life and a pollution-free atmosphere under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

Another case discussed a Writ Petition that was transferred to the Tribunal. The Tahsildar and Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 denied the allegations made by the Applicant Sonyabapu. The Regional Officer explained that the MPCB is not responsible for granting Consent to establish for brick kilns. Respondent No.7, Sitabai, who runs the brick kiln, claimed that it has been run traditionally since 1988 and that she has obtained necessary permission for Non-Agricultural use. She denied that the brick kiln is being run without any lawful permission and causing pollution. The court noted that the parties have already gone through one round of civil litigation and that the present Application concerns the threat to the environment caused by the brick kiln. The court considered whether any standards are prescribed for traditional brick kilns and whether the MPCB is the licensing authority for such kind of bricks industry. The court also referred to an MPCB report dated 12-11-2006, which showed that the brick kiln was located at a distance of 2 km from the village and was run seasonally for 5 months per year.

In another case, two separate applications were filed regarding brick kilns causing environmental damage. The first application involves a brick kiln operated by Respondent No.7 Sitabai, which was ordered to be closed due to smoke causing a nuisance to nearby residents. The court found that Sitabai did not have a valid permission to operate the brick kiln and that it posed a threat to the environment. The second application involves brick kilns operated by Respondent Nos. 5 and 6, which were causing air pollution and improper disposal of solid waste. The court ordered the respondents to take necessary measures to prevent environmental damage.

In yet another case, a brick kiln was causing environmental degradation and health concerns due to improper disposal of solid waste and emissions of air pollutants. The applicant had made complaints to the authorities, but no action had been taken. The guidelines for brick kiln operation were discussed, and the respondent claimed to be operating their traditional brick kilns legally and without using banned fuels. The respondent also argued that the brick kilns had not affected the surrounding agriculture fields.

In another case, two applications were filed regarding the operation of brick kilns and their impact on agriculture fields and human health. The court considered whether the kilns were being run in breach of environmental norms and if they should be closed down. The court noted that the MPCB had issued guidelines for running brick kilns and that there were five types of kilns. The court also considered whether the directions of the CPCB regarding the classification of industries into Red, Orange, and Green categories apply to traditional country-type brick kilns and whether any particular emission standards are prescribed or likely to be prescribed. The MPCB submitted that brick kilns require consent under the Water and Air Pollution Act and that emission standards are being developed.

The court order also discussed the MPCB's change of stance regarding the regulation of brick kilns under the consent regime. The MPCB has directed all brick kilns to obtain consent from the board, but the court noted that emission standards and environmental safeguards must be established before implementing this decision. The court also referenced the "Precautionary Principle" and the concept of sustainable development in making decisions related to environmental disputes.

The court order stated that the operation of brick kilns without necessary consent and air pollution control arrangements is illegal and poses a threat to the environment. The court directed concerned respondents to stop running the brick kilns and for the other respondents to ensure that the activity is closed down. The court allowed the applications with certain conditions, including the formulation and notification of emissions standards for clamp type traditional brick kilns and the consideration of suitable rules for brick kilns. The respondents owning and operating brick kilns have the right to apply for permission or consent to establish and operate the brick kiln if it is in accordance with relevant norms. The court order was allowed and disposed of with no costs.
