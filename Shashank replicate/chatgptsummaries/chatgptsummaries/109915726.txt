The case in question involves a complaint filed by M/s Rajbux Satish Kumar against the petitioner, Mandeep Singh, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complainant had alleged that the petitioner had issued a cheque for a certain amount, which was dishonored by the bank due to insufficient funds. The complainant had then sent a legal notice to the petitioner, demanding payment of the amount due. However, the petitioner failed to make the payment, leading to the filing of the complaint.

During the course of the trial, the petitioner had requested certain records of the complainant-firm for the period of 2003 to 2007. The learned trial court had partly allowed the request, directing the complainant to produce the relevant records. However, the complainant had failed to produce the records, leading to the filing of the petition in the High Court.

The petitioner had contended that the records were necessary to establish the bona fides of the complainant-firm and to prove that the cheque in question was not issued for a genuine debt. The petitioner had argued that the complainant-firm had a history of filing false cases and that the records would reveal the true nature of the transactions between the parties.

However, the High Court dismissed the petition, stating that the relevant record had already been summoned and the rest of the documents were not relevant to the case. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to establish the relevance of the documents and that the complainant had already produced the relevant record. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any specific allegations of fraud or misrepresentation against the complainant and that the records were not necessary to establish the case.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of the learned trial court, which had partly allowed the request for records. The court observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the records from the complainant-firm and had instead chosen to file a petition in the High Court. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference in the order of the learned trial court and dismissed the petition.
