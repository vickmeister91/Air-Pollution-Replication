The Patna High Court has issued an order to the State Pollution Control Board, Patna Municipal Corporation, and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to provide an updated status report on the manufacturing units that have been issued notices to close their units. These units are located in a residential zone where the manufacturing of almirah is not permissible. The court has adjourned the matter until October 8, 2018.

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by a group of residents who live near the manufacturing units. The residents had complained about the pollution caused by the manufacturing units and the noise generated by the machinery. They had also raised concerns about the safety of the children who play in the area.

The court had earlier issued notices to the manufacturing units to close their operations as they were located in a residential zone where the manufacturing of almirah was not permissible. The manufacturing units had challenged the notices in court, arguing that they had been operating in the area for many years and that they had all the necessary permissions and licenses.

The court had asked the State Pollution Control Board, Patna Municipal Corporation, and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to provide a status report on the manufacturing units. The report was supposed to provide details about the pollution caused by the manufacturing units and the steps taken by the authorities to address the issue.

The court had also asked the authorities to provide details about the licenses and permissions granted to the manufacturing units. The authorities were supposed to provide information about the conditions attached to the licenses and permissions and whether the manufacturing units had violated any of these conditions.

The manufacturing units had argued that they had all the necessary permissions and licenses to operate in the area. They had also argued that they had taken steps to reduce the pollution caused by their operations. They had installed pollution control equipment and had taken measures to reduce the noise generated by the machinery.

The residents, however, had argued that the manufacturing units were causing a lot of pollution and noise and that they were a danger to the health and safety of the people living in the area. They had also argued that the manufacturing units were violating the zoning laws and that they should be shut down.

The court had heard arguments from both sides and had asked the authorities to provide a status report on the manufacturing units. The court had also asked the manufacturing units to provide details about the licenses and permissions granted to them.

The court has now ordered the authorities to provide an updated status report on the manufacturing units. The report is supposed to provide details about the pollution caused by the manufacturing units and the steps taken by the authorities to address the issue. The report is also supposed to provide details about the licenses and permissions granted to the manufacturing units and whether they have violated any of the conditions attached to these licenses and permissions.

The court has adjourned the matter until October 8, 2018. The manufacturing units will have to wait until then to find out whether they will be allowed to continue their operations or whether they will have to shut down. The residents will also have to wait until then to find out whether their complaints about the pollution and noise caused by the manufacturing units will be addressed.
