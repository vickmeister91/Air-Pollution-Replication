The case at hand is an appeal against a court order refusing to set aside a divorce decree passed ex parte in a divorce suit. The plaintiff had filed the suit for divorce against his wife, and the summons was sent to her by registered post, which was returned unserved. The plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that the defendant had deliberately refused to accept the summons. The court accepted the affidavit and treated the summons as properly served, and a decree ex parte was passed against the defendant. 

The defendant later filed an application to set aside the decree, which was rejected by the court. The court held that service of summons by registered post is a valid mode of service, and the defendant did not take any steps to have the decree set aside. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that the summons was duly served upon the defendant, and there will be no order as to costs of this appeal.
