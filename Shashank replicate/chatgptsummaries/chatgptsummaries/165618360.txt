Air India Ltd. had filed a petition against the Union of India and another party, challenging an order passed by the respondent no.1. The order had dismissed an appeal filed by Air India against a penalty imposed by the respondent no.2 for allegedly violating provisions of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and Rules made thereunder. The appeal was dismissed on the grounds of being filed beyond the period of thirty days from the date of the order. Air India had filed an application for condoning the delay of eight days, which was not considered by the respondent.

The case was heard by the court, which held that the respondent had the power to condone the delay and erred in not considering the application. The court observed that the delay of eight days was not a significant delay, and the respondent should have considered the application for condonation of delay. The court further held that the respondent had not given any reasons for not considering the application, which was a violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court also noted that the respondent had not considered the merits of the case and had dismissed the appeal solely on the grounds of delay. The court held that the respondent should have considered the merits of the case and then decided whether to condone the delay or not. The court observed that the respondent had failed to exercise its discretion properly and had not considered all the relevant factors.

The court, therefore, set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the respondent to consider afresh on merits uninfluenced by the delay in preferring the appeal. The court directed the respondent to consider the application for condonation of delay and to give reasons for its decision. The court also directed the respondent to consider the merits of the case and to decide the matter accordingly.

In conclusion, the court held that the respondent had erred in not considering the application for condonation of delay and had failed to exercise its discretion properly. The court, therefore, set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the respondent to consider afresh on merits uninfluenced by the delay in preferring the appeal. The court directed the respondent to consider the application for condonation of delay and to give reasons for its decision. The court also directed the respondent to consider the merits of the case and to decide the matter accordingly.
