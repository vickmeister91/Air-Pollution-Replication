The High Court of Madras received a writ petition from the Coimbatore Consumer Cause, alleging that public buildings in Coimbatore were constructed without adequate fire safety provisions and that unauthorized constructions were taking place. The petitioner requested that suitable action be taken against these violations and that officials who colluded with building owners be disciplined. The court ordered the respondents to take appropriate action against unauthorized constructions and public buildings without fire safety provisions and to initiate disciplinary proceedings against officials who violated regulations.

The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation submitted an action taken report to the court, which listed 32 buildings that were either demolished or had their violations removed. The court also received an affidavit from the District Secretary of the Coimbatore Merchants Association, who provided suggestions for improvement and development of Coimbatore City. The court also received a communication from the Office of the Divisional Officer, Fire Rescue Service, which identified several places where people could not be evacuated easily in the event of a fire accident. The court ordered that suitable action be taken against these violations and that officials who colluded with building owners be disciplined.

The court order addresses the issue of haphazard construction in Coimbatore without regard for building regulations and statutory guidelines. The Coimbatore Corporation has taken steps to address the issue, but the court hopes that their efforts will continue to prevent further violations. The order mandates the installation of fire safety measures in buildings and suggests the creation of a Coimbatore Metropolitan Development Authority to streamline building permissions and inspections. The order also includes suggestions for fines and penalties for violations of building rules and unauthorized construction.

The court appreciates the efforts of the petitioner and the Coimbatore Corporation and disposes of the writ petition with no costs. The court hopes that the order will serve as a reminder to all concerned parties to follow building regulations and guidelines to ensure the safety of the public.
