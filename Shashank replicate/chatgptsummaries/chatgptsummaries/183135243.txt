The court order pertains to two separate petitions filed by Kamla Madan against Satish Aggarwal under section 14(1) (a) of the Delhi Rent Control (DRC) Act. The first petition concerns a dispute over the non-payment of rent by the respondent, who denies that the petitioner is his landlady and claims to have taken the premises on rent from someone else. The second petition concerns the eviction of the respondent from the property in question.

In the first petition, the petitioner claims to be the landlady of a shop in a property and that the respondent has not paid the rent legally recoverable from him. The respondent denies the claim and asserts that he has taken the premises on rent from someone else. The court needs to decide whether there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. The petitioner and respondent have given their respective evidence, and the court has heard the arguments of both parties.

In the second petition, the petitioner claimed to be authorized to receive rent on behalf of other legal heirs of late Ram Saran Das, and the respondent gave her a cheque of Rs.5,000/- without suspecting her. However, Sh. Pradeep Madan, son of late Ram Saran Das, approached the respondent and instructed him not to pay any amount to the petitioner as he was having a Will of late Ram Saran Das. The court found that the petitioner is a widow and legal heir of the original landlord and became the landlady of the property in question, and the respondent paid rent to her. The court also found that the notice was duly served upon the respondent, and the petitioner sought to enhance rent by 10% w.e.f. 01.02.2008. The court found that the respondent was in arrears of rent w.e.f. 01.04.2002, and the petitioner became entitled to an eviction order under Order 14 (1) (a) of DRC Act.

After hearing both parties and examining the evidence, the court found in favor of the petitioner in both petitions. In the first petition, the court found that the respondent was indeed the tenant of the petitioner and had not paid the rent legally recoverable from him. In the second petition, the court found that the petitioner was the legal heir of the original landlord and had the right to receive rent from the respondent. The court also found that the respondent was in arrears of rent and had not paid the enhanced rent sought by the petitioner.

Based on these findings, the court ordered the respondent to pay the arrears of rent to the petitioner and to vacate the property in question. The court also awarded costs to the petitioner in both petitions.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two petitions filed by Kamla Madan against Satish Aggarwal under section 14(1) (a) of the DRC Act. The court found in favor of the petitioner in both petitions and ordered the respondent to pay the arrears of rent and vacate the property in question. The court also awarded costs to the petitioner in both petitions.
