The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by the Ittina Akkala Apartment Owner's Association against the State of Karnataka, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, and Ittina Properties Private Limited. The court held that a substantive remedy of appeal has been provided under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and granted liberty to the petitioner to adopt the remedy.

The court held that the remedy of appeal is a substantive remedy and that the petitioners should have first approached the appellate authority before approaching the court.

The court also held that the petitioners had not provided any material to show that the respondents had caused any damage to the environment.

The court, therefore, declined to entertain the writ petition and granted liberty to the petitioners to adopt the remedy of appeal provided under Section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also kept all contentions raised in the petition open.
