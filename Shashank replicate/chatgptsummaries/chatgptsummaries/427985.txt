The Orissa High Court has upheld a notification by the Government of Orissa declaring the entire state as an air pollution control area for the purpose of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court also ruled that the State Government has the power to declare the entire state as a pollution control area under Section 19 of the Act. This decision is a significant step towards controlling air pollution in the state of Orissa.

The court rejected a plea to adapt the siting criteria of neighboring states for stone crusher units, stating that each state must fix its own criteria according to its environment. The court noted that some orders directing closure of stone crusher units were passed only on the basis of alleged violation of siting criteria prescribed under the Environment Protection Act. This decision is important as it emphasizes the need for each state to develop its own criteria for controlling pollution, rather than relying on the criteria of neighboring states.

The court order also pertains to an amendment made to the order of the Government of Orissa in the Forest and Environment Department regarding the distance between two stone crusher units. The amendment omits item No. 4 of the 1998 Notification. The court upholds the validity of the Notification dated 17th/18th July 2002, declaring the entire State of Orissa as Air Pollution Control Area under Section 19 of the Act, 1981.

However, the court quashes the impugned order of closure in some of the Writ Petitions passed on the basis of alleged violation of the siting criteria fixed by the government in 1998, which has since been amended. The Opposite Parties shall make a re-survey of the sites and take appropriate decisions. This decision is important as it ensures that closure orders are not passed solely on the basis of alleged violations of outdated criteria.

Overall, the court order is a significant step towards controlling air pollution in the state of Orissa. The court's decision to uphold the notification declaring the entire state as an air pollution control area and to emphasize the need for each state to develop its own criteria for controlling pollution is important. The court's decision to quash closure orders passed solely on the basis of alleged violations of outdated criteria is also important as it ensures that closure orders are passed only after a re-survey of the sites and appropriate decisions are taken.
