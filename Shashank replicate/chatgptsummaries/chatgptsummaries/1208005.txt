The court order pertains to a petition filed by M.C. Mehta seeking protection of the river Ganga from pollution caused by tanneries. The court issued the order under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. The order directed the respondents to establish primary treatment plants for trade effluents before discharging them into the river and ordered the closure of tanneries that failed to comply. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and the duty of citizens to do so.

The court order also pertains to a public interest litigation filed by a social worker seeking a writ/order/direction in the nature of mandamus to restrain respondents from letting out trade effluents into the river Ganga until necessary treatment plants are put up to arrest pollution. The court directed the issue of notice to industrialists and local bodies to show cause as to why directions should not be issued to them. The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and cited Article 48-A and 51-A of the Constitution, as well as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment's proclamation. The court then proceeded to consider the case against tanneries near Kanpur.

The court order discusses the importance of preventing pollution to avoid irreversible damage to ecosystems and human health. It mentions the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which provide for the prevention and control of water pollution and the protection of the environment. The court notes that despite these laws, the tanneries at Jajmau in Kanpur have been discharging trade effluents into the river Ganga, causing damage to aquatic life and the people who use the water. The tanneries have formed an association to establish common effluent treatment plants, but the court finds that not enough has been done to prevent pollution.

The court order discusses the issue of treating effluents from tanneries in India. The Pollution Control Boards have mandated that all industries must treat their effluents to prescribed standards, and the leather industry is no exception. The Central Leather Research Institute has developed a Management Investment Report with flow sheets indicating treatment technologies for various types of leather processing techniques. The report recommends four types of wastewater treatment technology for tanneries: segregation or mixing of suitable sectional wastewater, primary treatment, secondary biological treatment, and disposal of solid wastes from the treatment system. The court order also references a study of tanneries in Jajmau, Kanpur, which found that each tannery should make arrangements for primary treatment of their effluent before it is discharged into a common treatment plant. The court order also discusses the pollution of the Ganga river and the need to prevent pollution from urban and industrial liquid waste.

The court order requires industries to feed their wastewaters into the city sewer for treatment, provided the waste is free from certain harmful substances. The order also requires careful examination of integrating or segregating industrial waste for conveyance and treatment, and sharing of costs between city authorities and industries. The memorandum presented by the Department of Environment explains the situation in Jajmau area of Kanpur, where tanneries are causing environmental degradation and polluting the river Ganga. The court directs certain tanneries to stop running their operations and not to discharge trade effluents into the river without subjecting them to a pretreatment process by setting up primary treatment plants.

The court order requires certain tanneries to set up primary treatment plants approved by the State Board to reduce pollution in the Ganga river. Tanneries that have already established such plants may continue production, but all tanneries must keep their plants in working order. Tanneries that have not established primary treatment plants must do so within six months or cease operations. The court emphasizes the importance of the Ganga river to Indian culture and the need for all those who reside or do business around it to ensure its purity. The order also directs the Central Government, the Uttar Pradesh Board, and the District Magistrate to enforce the order faithfully. The case is adjourned to consider the case against municipal bodies in Uttar Pradesh with jurisdiction over the areas through which the Ganga river passes.

The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and the duty of citizens to do so.
