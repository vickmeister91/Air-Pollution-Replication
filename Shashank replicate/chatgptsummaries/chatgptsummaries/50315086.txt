The petitioner filed a review petition and a curative petition, both of which were dismissed. The petitioner challenged the cancellation of the lease and subsequent actions taken by the government in the two writ petitions. The court held that the cancellation of the lease had attained finality and the petitioner had no locus to proceed with the petitions. The petitions were dismissed.

The case of Sri Ram Rao M Poal is a classic example of the legal principle of finality. The petitioner had been granted a mining lease, which was subsequently cancelled by the Apex Court in 2013. The petitioner filed a review petition and a curative petition, both of which were dismissed. The petitioner then challenged the cancellation of the lease and subsequent actions taken by the government in the two writ petitions. However, the court held that the cancellation of the lease had attained finality and the petitioner had no locus to proceed with the petitions.

The principle of finality is an important legal principle that is designed to ensure that legal disputes are resolved in a timely and efficient manner. The principle of finality holds that once a decision has been made by a court, that decision is final and cannot be challenged again. This principle is designed to prevent endless litigation and to ensure that legal disputes are resolved in a timely and efficient manner.

In the case of Sri Ram Rao M Poal, the principle of finality was applied to the cancellation of the mining lease. The court held that the cancellation of the lease had attained finality and that the petitioner had no locus to proceed with the petitions. This means that the petitioner cannot challenge the cancellation of the lease again and that the matter is now closed.

The court's decision in this case is important because it reaffirms the principle of finality and ensures that legal disputes are resolved in a timely and efficient manner. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to litigants that they must be diligent in pursuing their legal remedies and that they cannot challenge a decision once it has attained finality.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Sri Ram Rao M Poal reaffirms the principle of finality and ensures that legal disputes are resolved in a timely and efficient manner. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to litigants that they must be diligent in pursuing their legal remedies and that they cannot challenge a decision once it has attained finality.
