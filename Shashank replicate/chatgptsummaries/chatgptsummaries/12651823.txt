The court further stated that if an appeal is filed within four weeks, the learned Authority shall decide the appeal on merits, after giving opportunity of hearing to the petitioner by passing a speaking and reasoned order in accordance with law.

The case involved the rejection of an application by M/S Chaudhary Stone Crusher & Screening Plant for consent to operate a stone crusher unit. The company had applied for consent to operate the unit on a plot of land measuring 0.5 hectares in village Bajpur, District Udham Singh Nagar. The application was rejected by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB) on 15.1.2020.

M/S Chaudhary Stone Crusher & Screening Plant then filed a writ petition in the Allahabad High Court challenging the rejection of their application. The company argued that the rejection was arbitrary and without any basis in law. They also argued that the rejection violated their fundamental right to carry on their business.

The Allahabad High Court heard the arguments of both parties and examined the relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that under Section 28 of the Water Act and Section 30 of the Air Act, any person aggrieved by an order of the Pollution Control Board may file an appeal within 30 days of the order.

The court further noted that the rejection order dated 15.1.2020 did not contain any reasons for the rejection. The court held that this was a serious lapse on the part of the Pollution Control Board and violated the principles of natural justice. The court stated that the rejection order must contain reasons for the rejection so that the applicant can understand the basis for the rejection and challenge it effectively.

The court also noted that the Pollution Control Board had not given M/S Chaudhary Stone Crusher & Screening Plant an opportunity to be heard before rejecting their application. The court held that this was a violation of the principles of natural justice and the company's right to be heard.

In light of these findings, the court ordered that a copy of the rejection order be supplied to the company within 10 days so that they may file an appeal under Section 28 of the Water Act and Section 30 of the Air Act. The court further ordered that if an appeal is filed within four weeks, the learned Authority shall decide the appeal on merits, after giving opportunity of hearing to the petitioner by passing a speaking and reasoned order in accordance with law.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's order in the case of M/S Chaudhary Stone Crusher & Screening Plant highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and providing reasons for decisions. The court's order ensures that the company has an opportunity to challenge the rejection of their application and have their appeal heard on its merits.
