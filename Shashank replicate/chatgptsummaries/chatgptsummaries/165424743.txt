The Madras High Court recently passed a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by R. Ravimaran against the Union of India and other respondents. The petitioner sought a direction to effect a comprehensive clean-up and remediation of areas affected by the illegal discharge of ash by the third respondent in Ennore, in violation of the environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner also sought compensation for affected people, closure of the third respondent thermal power plant at Ennore for violations committed, and prosecution of responsible officers in terms of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court noted that the case was pending before the National Green Tribunal, but since a quorum was not available, the petitioner had approached the court. The court allowed the writ petition to be heard and passed appropriate orders. However, the court order states that the petitioner cannot seek relief from the court as the National Green Tribunal is already hearing the case. The court cites a previous judgment that environmental issues should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal and not before the court. The petitioner is directed to approach the National Green Tribunal and the writ petition is dismissed. The court hopes that the National Green Tribunal will expedite the hearing.

The court order lists the names and addresses of various individuals and organizations, including the Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, the Chief Engineer of North Chennai Thermal Power Station, the District Environmental Engineer of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the Member Secretary of Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority, and the Secretary to Government of Public Works Department. However, the purpose of the court order is not specified.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition and direct the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal is in line with previous judgments that have emphasized the importance of litigating environmental issues before specialized tribunals. The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 to handle cases related to environmental protection and conservation, and has the power to hear cases related to air and water pollution, forest conservation, and biodiversity. The tribunal has been instrumental in addressing environmental issues across the country, and has been praised for its efficiency and effectiveness.

The court's decision to list the names and addresses of various individuals and organizations is likely aimed at ensuring that they are aware of the case and can take appropriate action if necessary. The Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, the Chief Engineer of North Chennai Thermal Power Station, and the District Environmental Engineer of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board are all likely to be involved in the management and regulation of the Ennore thermal power plant, and may be responsible for ensuring that the plant operates in compliance with environmental regulations. The Member Secretary of Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority and the Secretary to Government of Public Works Department may also be involved in the management and regulation of the Ennore area, and may be responsible for ensuring that the area is protected and conserved.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of addressing environmental issues through specialized tribunals such as the National Green Tribunal, and emphasizes the need for responsible officers and organizations to take appropriate action to protect the environment. The court's decision to list the names and addresses of various individuals and organizations is likely aimed at ensuring that they are aware of the case and can take appropriate action if necessary. It remains to be seen how the National Green Tribunal will handle the case, and whether the Ennore area will be able to recover from the damage caused by the illegal discharge of ash.
