Another court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court details the facts of the case and the demands made by the petitioners, ultimately ruling on the legality of the demand notice and the responsibility for depositing the NPV.

In another court order, the petitioner and 63 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

The court order pertaining to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, involves the mining lease holders collectively submitting a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court order pertaining to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes finds that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders are required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, excluding the 62 cancelled/surrendered/lapsed leases, and to divide the common areas of transport and storage equally among the active mining lease holders. The court also directs the Mining Department to relinquish the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed leases in accordance with their policy letters.
