The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was the respondent in a criminal petition filed by Sri A R Soudagar seeking to quash a criminal case filed against him for an offense under Section 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief from the criminal proceedings initiated against him. The court granted an interim order and directed the standing counsel to take notice for the respondent. However, the petitioner failed to take steps for service of notice on the respondent, and the court passed a conditional order granting one week's time to take steps failing which the application would be dismissed.

The court allowed the application and found that the proceedings before the trial court could not be quashed or stalled on the ground of want of sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. The court held that the sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. was not required in the present case as the alleged offense was not committed in the discharge of official duty. The court observed that the petitioner was not a public servant and the alleged offense was not committed in the discharge of his official duty. Therefore, the court held that the proceedings before the trial court could not be quashed or stalled on the ground of want of sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for quashing the criminal proceedings against him. The court held that the allegations made against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court noted that the petitioner had not produced any material to show that the allegations made against him were false or baseless. Therefore, the court held that the criminal proceedings against the petitioner could not be quashed at this stage.

The court also observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the law. The court noted that the petitioner could approach the trial court and seek discharge from the criminal proceedings if he so desired. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to bypass the normal legal process and seek relief from the court at this stage.
