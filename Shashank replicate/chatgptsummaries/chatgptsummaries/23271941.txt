The Allahabad High Court received a petition for writ to have the Office of Chairman, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board vacated by respondent no. 3, Jayendra Pratap Singh (J.P.S. Rathaur), who the petitioner claims is not qualified for the position. The court did not find the allegation to be well-founded but directed the Principal Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, Department of Environment to supply the necessary details to the petitioner within 15 days. The petition for writ was disposed of on December 18, 2019.

The case in question pertains to the appointment of Jayendra Pratap Singh (J.P.S. Rathaur) as the Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had filed a writ petition seeking to have Rathaur vacate the position on the grounds that he was not qualified for the job. The court, however, did not find the allegations to be well-founded and dismissed the petition.

The court directed the Principal Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, Department of Environment to supply the necessary details to the petitioner within 15 days. This was done to ensure that the petitioner had access to all the relevant information regarding Rathaur's appointment and qualifications.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that Rathaur had been appointed to the position by the state government after a thorough selection process. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that Rathaur was not qualified for the job or that the selection process had been flawed in any way.

The court's decision to direct the Principal Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, Department of Environment to supply the necessary details to the petitioner was a measure to ensure transparency in the appointment process. The court wanted to ensure that the petitioner had access to all the relevant information regarding Rathaur's appointment and qualifications so that they could make an informed decision about whether or not to pursue the matter further.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was a balanced one. While it dismissed the petition, it also took steps to ensure transparency in the appointment process. This is an important step towards ensuring that the selection process for government positions is fair and transparent, and that qualified individuals are appointed to these positions.
