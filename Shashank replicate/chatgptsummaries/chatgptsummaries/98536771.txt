The court has granted anticipatory bail to Ramesh Taram, who was apprehensive of arrest in connection with a wildlife protection act case.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an important legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The act has been amended several times to strengthen its provisions and to address emerging issues related to wildlife conservation.

In this case, Ramesh Taram was apprehensive of arrest in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The details of the case are not clear from the court order, but it can be assumed that the allegations against the applicant relate to some violation of the provisions of the act. The court has granted anticipatory bail to the applicant, which means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with the case, as long as he complies with the conditions of the bail order.

The court has directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the like amount. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that he will appear before the court as and when required, and will not commit any further offence while on bail. A surety is a person who undertakes to produce the accused before the court when required, and to pay the bail amount in case the accused fails to appear before the court. The court has also directed the applicant to make himself available for interrogation by a police officer, which means that he must cooperate with the investigation and provide any information or evidence that may be required.

The court has further directed the applicant to abide by the conditions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, provides for the grant of anticipatory bail in certain cases. The section lays down certain conditions that must be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. These conditions include the nature and gravity of the offence, the likelihood of the applicant fleeing from justice, and the possibility of the applicant tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses. The court has considered these factors and has granted anticipatory bail to the applicant.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Ramesh Taram in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The applicant has denied being present at the place of occurrence and has expressed his willingness to cooperate in the investigation and trial. The court has directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the like amount, and to make himself available for interrogation by a police officer. The court has also directed the applicant to abide by the conditions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. The grant of anticipatory bail is a relief for the applicant, as it ensures that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with the case, as long as he complies with the conditions of the bail order.
