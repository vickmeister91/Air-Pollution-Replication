The Delhi High Court recently heard a case brought by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd against the Ministry of Environment and Forests and others. The petitioner requested a writ or order to act on their representations without delay, adopt a clarification that is harmonious with the dominant purpose of the Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006, and issue a writ of mandamus or any other writ or order or direction restraining the Respondent No.2 from issuing any further orders or directions with respect to the Petitioner's projects or activities. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately ruled in favor of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

The court order states that any project or activity with a built-up area of over 20,000 sq. mts. requires Environmental Clearance (EC) under Item 8(a) and 8(b) of the Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006. The petitioner did not apply for prior EC, but the court found that they did not act with malafide intent and ordered them to obtain ex post facto EC and comply with all terms and conditions stipulated by the EC. The court also directed the respondents not to initiate any criminal action against the petitioner and/or its Board Member/officials. The order is specific to this case and should not be treated as a precedent.
