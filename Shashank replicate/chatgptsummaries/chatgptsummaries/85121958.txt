The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently granted bail to Rajesh and Kamal Singh, who were accused of selling wild boar meat in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court considered several factors in its decision, including the lack of forensic evidence and the fact that the accused had been in custody since March 19, 2019.

The case against Rajesh and Kamal Singh began when they were arrested for allegedly selling wild boar meat in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or sale of any wild animal without a permit from the government. The accused were charged under Section 9 of the Act, which deals with the hunting or poaching of wild animals.

During the trial, the prosecution presented several witnesses who claimed to have seen the accused selling wild boar meat. However, the defense argued that there was no forensic evidence to support these claims. They also pointed out that the accused had been in custody for over a year, which was a significant amount of time for a case of this nature.

After considering all the evidence presented by both sides, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh granted bail to Rajesh and Kamal Singh. The court noted that there was no forensic evidence to support the prosecution's claims and that the accused had been in custody for a significant amount of time. The court also took into account the fact that the accused had no prior criminal record and were not likely to flee from justice.

The court ordered that Rajesh and Kamal Singh be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 20,000/- each with one solvent surety. This means that the accused will be released from custody but will have to provide a personal bond and a surety to ensure that they appear in court for all future hearings.

The decision of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has been welcomed by many, who believe that the accused were unfairly targeted and that there was no evidence to support the charges against them. However, others have criticized the decision, arguing that it sends the wrong message to those who violate wildlife protection laws.

Overall, the case of Rajesh and Kamal Singh highlights the importance of having strong evidence to support criminal charges. Without forensic evidence, it can be difficult to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is necessary for a conviction. It also underscores the need for fair and timely trials, as prolonged periods of custody can be detrimental to the accused and their families.
