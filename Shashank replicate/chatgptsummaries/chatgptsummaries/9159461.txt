The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a criminal petition filed by Muthoot Finance Limited against the Circle Inspector of Police. The petition was filed in connection with a notice issued under Sections 91 and 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The notice had called upon the petitioner to produce certain gold articles in connection with a case registered for the offences punishable under Sections 420, 468, 471 r/w. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and also Sections 3 and 4 of Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978.

The petitioner, Muthoot Finance Limited, is a non-banking financial company that provides loans against gold. The company had received a notice from the police asking them to produce certain gold articles that were allegedly pledged with them by the accused in the case. The police had claimed that the accused had obtained the gold articles by cheating and had pledged them with the petitioner.

The petitioner had challenged the notice on the grounds that the police had not provided any evidence to show that the gold articles were actually purchased by the accused and thereafter pledged with the petitioner. The petitioner had argued that the police cannot simply assume that the gold articles were obtained by cheating and had been pledged with them.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, quashed the notice issued by the police. The court held that the police must first secure material that the items were actually purchased by the accused and thereafter pledged with the petitioner. The court observed that the police cannot simply assume that the gold articles were obtained by cheating and had been pledged with the petitioner.

The court also gave the police the liberty to invoke Sections 91 and 161 of the Cr.P.C. later if necessary. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a police officer to examine any person who is supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of a case.

The court's decision is significant as it reiterates the principle that the police cannot simply assume that an accused has obtained certain items by cheating and has pledged them with a financial institution. The police must first secure material to prove their case before issuing notices to financial institutions asking them to produce the pledged items.

The judgment also highlights the importance of due process and the need for the police to follow the procedures laid down in the Cr.P.C. before issuing notices to financial institutions. The court's decision will have far-reaching implications for cases where the police have issued notices to financial institutions asking them to produce pledged items without providing any evidence to support their case.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's decision in the criminal petition filed by Muthoot Finance Limited against the Circle Inspector of Police is a significant one. The court's decision reiterates the principle that the police cannot simply assume that an accused has obtained certain items by cheating and has pledged them with a financial institution. The police must first secure material to prove their case before issuing notices to financial institutions asking them to produce the pledged items. The judgment also highlights the importance of due process and the need for the police to follow the procedures laid down in the Cr.P.C. before issuing notices to financial institutions.
