The Karnataka High Court issued a court order on December 26, 2012, in the case of M/S Parvati Stone Crusher vs State of Karnataka. The petitioner, M/s Parvathi Stone Crusher, was running a stone crushing unit under a valid license issued by the competent authority. However, the Karnataka Pollution Control Board issued a closure notice to the petitioner, which prompted the petitioner to seek a writ of certiorari to quash the closure notice and a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit.

The court considered the petitioner's arguments and quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board. The court also allowed the petitioner to operate the crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had a valid license to operate the crushing unit and that the closure notice was issued without proper consideration of the petitioner's application. The court also noted that the petitioner had taken steps to address the concerns raised by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and had submitted a revised plan of action to address the pollution caused by the crushing unit.

The court's decision was a significant victory for the petitioner, as it allowed them to continue operating the crushing unit while their application was being considered by the licensing authority. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of due process and proper consideration of applications before issuing closure notices.

In contrast, the second court order lacks any meaningful information and is incomplete, making it impossible to summarize. However, the first court order highlights the importance of following due process and considering applications before issuing closure notices. It also emphasizes the need for businesses to comply with environmental regulations and take steps to address any concerns raised by regulatory authorities.
