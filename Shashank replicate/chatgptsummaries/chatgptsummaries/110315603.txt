In a recent court order, an interlocutory application was allowed to amend the prayer portion in the main application filed by Saryu Yadav. The main application sought to quash the entire criminal proceeding against them, including the orders by which bailable/non-bailable warrant of arrest has been issued. The court granted the application to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and ordered that the interlocutory application be treated as a part of the main application.

Furthermore, the court stayed the proceeding in connection with G.F. Case No. 35 of 2016 until further orders. This means that the case will not proceed until the court issues further orders. The case was listed after four weeks, and the opposite party was granted four weeks' time to file a counter affidavit.

The court's decision to allow the amendment of the prayer portion in the main application is significant as it allows Saryu Yadav to include additional requests in their application. This could potentially strengthen their case and increase the likelihood of the entire criminal proceeding being quashed.

The court's decision to stay the proceeding in connection with G.F. Case No. 35 of 2016 is also significant as it provides Saryu Yadav with temporary relief from the ongoing criminal proceeding. This allows them time to prepare their case and potentially negotiate a settlement with the opposite party.

Overall, the court's order is a positive development for Saryu Yadav as it allows them to strengthen their case and provides them with temporary relief from the ongoing criminal proceeding. However, it is important to note that the case is still ongoing and further orders from the court will be required before a final decision is reached.
