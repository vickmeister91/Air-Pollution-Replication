Two court orders have been issued in relation to motor accident claims appeals. The first case involves an appeal by Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. against an award given by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in Pathanamthitta. The appellant had argued that the injured party was a gratuitous passenger and not covered under the policy. The court referred to Sections 146 and 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1994, which require insurance policies to cover third-party risks and specified persons. The court held that the injured party was not covered under the policy as he was not an owner of the goods or an authorized representative carried in the vehicle. The court also referred to a previous case where the liability of the insurer towards a spare driver was explained.

The second case pertains to an employee who was injured while travelling in a vehicle as a spare driver. The appellant argued that there was no insurance coverage for spare drivers in the policy. The court held that the policy only covers liability in respect of death or bodily injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment, and not all kinds of employees. The injured employee was not driving the vehicle and was not engaged in driving the vehicle at the time of the accident, and therefore, was not covered by the policy. The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the award passed by the tribunal.
