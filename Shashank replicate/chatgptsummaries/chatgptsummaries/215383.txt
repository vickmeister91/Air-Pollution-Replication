The court order under discussion pertains to the procedural law and the scope of provisions contained in Sections 91, 227, and 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court explains the marked and sharp change in the procedure of the Sessions trial in the new Code compared to the old Code. The court concludes that under the procedural law, the accused does not have the right to invite the court to consider any additional material other than the one collected by the police, lodged with the Magistrate, and forwarded to the Court of Session, on which the prosecution wants to rely for the purpose of claiming a discharge. The prosecution must be given an opportunity to present their case, and the accused cannot lead any evidence in the committal proceeding or in the Sessions Court before the scheduled point of time.

The court order further states that the defence cannot wholesale accept material that conflicts with legally admissible material produced by the prosecution. The burden of proof is on the defence to substantiate their plea of alibi, and the prosecution must be given an opportunity to challenge it. The defence cannot simply present documents without giving the prosecution an opportunity to challenge their genuineness and truthfulness. The court also discusses the provisions of Section 91, which allows the defence to call for documents, but notes that these documents cannot be used until the appropriate stage of the trial. The court allows for exceptions where the defence may need to confront prosecution witnesses with certain documents, but these documents cannot be considered before the framing of charges.
