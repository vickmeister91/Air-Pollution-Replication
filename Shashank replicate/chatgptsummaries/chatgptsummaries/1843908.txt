The Gauhati High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Modern Lube Industries, which challenged the order of the Pollution Control Board, Assam. The order directed the petitioner to close down its industrial unit with immediate effect. The petitioner's industry was engaged in the trade of re-refining of used and waste lubricants, which are branded and characterized as hazardous wastes. The Pollution Control Board, Assam directed the petitioner to close down its unit on the basis of the intimation from the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi that the petitioner's industry is yet to be registered with the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi as a recycler or re-refiner of hazardous wastes.

The court held that the petitioner cannot undertake any activity of recycling or re-refining without obtaining a proper certificate of registration under Rule 19 of the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 from the Central Pollution Control Board. The court directed the Pollution Control Board, Assam to forthwith take steps to close the petitioner's industrial unit.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining proper certification and registration before undertaking any activity related to hazardous waste management. The Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989, provide for the proper management and handling of hazardous wastes in the country. The rules require all industries engaged in the handling, generation, and disposal of hazardous wastes to obtain a certificate of registration from the Central Pollution Control Board.

The court's decision in this case is in line with the provisions of the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989. The rules aim to prevent and control the generation, handling, and disposal of hazardous wastes. The rules also provide for the safe and environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes.

The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of the rules related to hazardous waste management. The Pollution Control Board, Assam, acted in accordance with the rules when it directed the petitioner to close down its industrial unit. The board's action was based on the intimation from the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi, which highlighted the petitioner's failure to obtain proper registration and certification.

The case also highlights the need for greater awareness and education about hazardous waste management. Industries engaged in the handling, generation, and disposal of hazardous wastes must be aware of the rules and regulations related to hazardous waste management. They must also take steps to ensure that they comply with these rules and regulations.
