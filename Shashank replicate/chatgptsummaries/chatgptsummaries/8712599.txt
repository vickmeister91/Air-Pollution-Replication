In a recent court order, the issue at hand was the illegal transportation of sand by a truck, which was subsequently seized by the police. The applicant, who is the registered owner of the vehicle, sought interim custody of the truck and its release on supurdiginama. The court has directed that the interim custody of the vehicle be given to the applicant subject to certain conditions.

The conditions set by the court include the furnishing of a personal bond and a bank guarantee, as well as an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used in any anti-social activities. The court has also directed the applicant to produce the original registration and sale-letter of the vehicle and get it photographed in the presence of a responsible officer.

The order cites previous cases where vehicles were released on supurdiginama even if confiscation proceedings were pending before the competent court. This indicates that the court is willing to consider releasing the truck to the applicant, despite the ongoing legal proceedings.

The court's decision to grant interim custody of the vehicle to the applicant is significant, as it allows the applicant to continue using the truck for their business or personal needs. However, the conditions set by the court ensure that the vehicle is not used for any illegal activities.

The requirement for a personal bond and a bank guarantee is a common practice in such cases, as it provides a financial incentive for the applicant to comply with the court's orders. The undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used in any anti-social activities is also a standard condition, as it ensures that the vehicle is not used for any illegal purposes.

The court's directive to produce the original registration and sale-letter of the vehicle and get it photographed in the presence of a responsible officer is also significant. This ensures that the vehicle is properly documented and that there is no dispute over its ownership.

Overall, the court's order is a balanced one, as it allows the applicant to retain custody of the vehicle while ensuring that it is not used for any illegal activities. The conditions set by the court are reasonable and standard in such cases, and the order is in line with previous cases where vehicles were released on supurdiginama even if confiscation proceedings were pending before the competent court.
