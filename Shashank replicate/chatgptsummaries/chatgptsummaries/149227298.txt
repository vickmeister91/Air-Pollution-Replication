The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Punau Vishwakarma, who has been arrested in connection with a forest crime case. The prosecution alleges that Vishwakarma, along with other co-accused persons, hunted bison using live electricity wire and has been charged under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. Vishwakarma's counsel argues that he has been falsely implicated and that the charge sheet has already been filed, leaving no chance of tampering with evidence. However, the court denies the bail application, citing the severity of the offence and the fact that Vishwakarma was absconding for a period of time.

The case against Vishwakarma and his co-accused persons is a serious one, as it involves the illegal hunting of a protected species using a cruel and inhumane method. The use of live electricity wire to hunt bison is not only illegal but also poses a significant risk to the safety of both the hunters and the animals. The Wild Life Protection Act, under which Vishwakarma has been charged, is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect and conserve India's rich biodiversity. The Act provides for stringent penalties for offences related to the hunting, poaching, and trade of wildlife.

Vishwakarma's counsel has argued that he has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no chance of tampering with evidence, as the charge sheet has already been filed. However, the court has rejected this argument, stating that the severity of the offence and the fact that Vishwakarma was absconding for a period of time make him a flight risk. The court has also noted that the use of live electricity wire to hunt bison is a particularly heinous crime and that the accused persons must be held accountable for their actions.

The court's decision to deny Vishwakarma's bail application is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. The court has taken into account the seriousness of the offence and the potential harm that could be caused to both the environment and the community. The court has also considered the fact that Vishwakarma was absconding for a period of time, which suggests that he may not be willing to cooperate with the authorities. By denying Vishwakarma's bail application, the court has sent a strong message that wildlife crimes will not be tolerated and that those who engage in such activities will be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Punau Vishwakarma, who has been arrested in connection with a forest crime case. The court has denied Vishwakarma's bail application, citing the severity of the offence and the fact that he was absconding for a period of time. The case against Vishwakarma and his co-accused persons is a serious one, as it involves the illegal hunting of a protected species using a cruel and inhumane method. The court's decision to deny Vishwakarma's bail application is in line with the principles of justice and fairness and sends a strong message that wildlife crimes will not be tolerated.
