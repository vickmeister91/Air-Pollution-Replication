The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a group of writ petitions filed by quarrying permit holders who had not obtained a no-objection certificate from the District Collector as required under sub-rule (5) of rule 5 of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1967 before they applied for the grant of quarrying permits. The court held that the quarrying permits were not issued to the petitioners after following the prescribed procedure and were therefore liable to be cancelled or revoked.

The court clarified that the judgment would not stand in the way of the petitioners from moving the District Collector for the grant of no-objection certificates. In the event of the District Collector granting a no-objection certificate, it would be open to those petitioners who are issued a no-objection certificate to move the Geologist for the grant of a fresh quarrying permit.

The Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1967, govern the grant of quarrying permits in the state of Kerala. Rule 5 of the said rules provides for the procedure for the grant of quarrying permits. Sub-rule (5) of rule 5 requires the applicant to obtain a no-objection certificate from the District Collector before applying for the grant of a quarrying permit.

The petitioners in the present case had not obtained a no-objection certificate from the District Collector before applying for the grant of quarrying permits. The petitioners contended that they were not aware of the requirement of obtaining a no-objection certificate from the District Collector and that they had applied for the grant of quarrying permits in good faith.

The court, however, held that ignorance of the law is not an excuse and that the petitioners were bound to comply with the requirements of the law. The court further held that the quarrying permits were not issued to the petitioners after following the prescribed procedure and were therefore liable to be cancelled or revoked.

The court also observed that the grant of quarrying permits is subject to the condition that the permit holder shall comply with the provisions of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1967, and the conditions of the permit. The court held that the petitioners had failed to comply with the provisions of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1967, and the conditions of the permit and were therefore liable to have their permits cancelled or revoked.

The court clarified that the judgment would not stand in the way of the petitioners from moving the District Collector for the grant of no-objection certificates. The court observed that the grant of a no-objection certificate is a prerequisite for the grant of a quarrying permit and that the petitioners would have to comply with the requirements of the law before applying for the grant of a quarrying permit.
