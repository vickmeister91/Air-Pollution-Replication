The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Kaptan Singh against an order passed by the SDM, Model Town. The order directed the SHO Police Station Model Town to remove the submersible pump installed at Singh's property if no permission was shown by the owner. Singh challenged the order on the grounds that the mandate of Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 had not been observed and that the principles of natural justice had not been followed.

The court found that the SDM had not followed due process of law and set aside the impugned order. The court's decision was based on the fact that the SDM had not given Singh an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The court also found that the SDM had not followed the principles of natural justice, which require that a person be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against them.

The court's decision is significant because it reaffirms the importance of due process of law and the principles of natural justice. These principles are fundamental to the functioning of a fair and just legal system. The court's decision also highlights the need for government officials to follow the law and observe the principles of natural justice when making decisions that affect the rights of citizens.

The court's decision is also important in the context of environmental protection. The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 are designed to protect the environment and ensure that development activities are carried out in a sustainable manner. The court's decision reinforces the importance of these rules and the need for government officials to follow them when making decisions that affect the environment.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the rule of law and the principles of natural justice. It reaffirms the importance of due process of law and the need for government officials to follow the law when making decisions that affect the rights of citizens. It also highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for government officials to follow the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 when making decisions that affect the environment.
