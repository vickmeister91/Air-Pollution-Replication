The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri. Rajashekar against Smt. Vidyarani for quashing an order passed by the family court in Belgaum. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon the salary documents and bank account details of the respondent. However, the Trial Court rejected the application on the ground that the purpose of the bank account details was not specified.

The petitioner then approached the High Court with a writ petition seeking to quash the order of the Trial Court. The High Court, however, dismissed the writ petition without reference to the respondent.

The court observed that if the respondent fails to produce the bank account details, the petitioner can ask the Trial Court to draw adverse inference against the respondent. This means that if the respondent fails to produce the bank account details, the Trial Court can assume that the respondent has something to hide and can draw an adverse inference against her.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the purpose of Section 91 Cr.P.C. is to enable the court to compel the production of documents that are necessary for the just decision of a case. The court noted that the petitioner had not specified the purpose for which the bank account details were required. Therefore, the Trial Court was justified in rejecting the application.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any attempt to obtain the bank account details through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the bank. The court noted that the petitioner had not even made a request to the respondent to produce the bank account details voluntarily.

The court's decision highlights the importance of specifying the purpose for which documents are required when making an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. It also emphasizes the need for parties to make reasonable efforts to obtain the documents they require before approaching the court.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to litigants that they must be diligent in their efforts to obtain the documents they require and must provide a clear and specific purpose for their request. Failure to do so may result in their application being rejected by the court.
