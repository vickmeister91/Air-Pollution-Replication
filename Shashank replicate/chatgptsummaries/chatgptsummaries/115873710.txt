The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by multiple petitioners against the Government of Tamil Nadu, the District Forest Officer, and Indian Oil Corporation. The petitioners sought the renewal of their leasehold area of 50 cents in Chennimalai Village, Perundurai Taluk, Erode District, which was rejected by the respondents. The petitioners argued that they were dealers of Indian Oil Corporation and were running a petrol and kerosene bunk on the leased property. The court heard the arguments and reserved its judgment.

Another court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner who runs a petrol and kerosene bunk on leased land. The petitioner had applied for renewal of the lease, which was rejected by the government citing that the land was a reserved forest area and could not be leased out for commercial purposes. The petitioner challenged this decision, arguing that a Panchayat Union Office building was functioning adjacent to the leased area. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately upheld the government's decision, citing legal precedents that prohibit habitation or commercial activity in reserved forest areas.

The court order states that the government intends to develop naturally grown forests on a piece of land and can only do so if they take possession of it. The Forest Conservation Act applies to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification, and the term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in government records. The court reiterates that this is the settled position and any state government that has failed to appreciate the correct position in law should correct its stance.

In another court order, the court has ordered all State Governments to immediately cease any non-forest activity within any forest without prior approval from the Central Government. The court also rejected a writ petitioner's claim for renewal of lease in a Reserved Forest Area, stating that no habituation or otherwise must be permitted in the Reserved Forest Area. The court ordered the eviction of the petrol and kerosene bunks and the Panchayat Union Office from the Reserved Forest Area and for appropriate steps to be taken to shift the Panchayat Union Office to any other suitable place. The court emphasized the need to protect Reserved Forest Areas in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The court order confirms an earlier decision to evict the writ petitioner from premises in a Reserved Forest Area within 30 days. If the petitioner does not vacate, the respondents are authorized to evict with police assistance. The respondents are also directed to move the Panchayat Union Office from the Reserved Forest Area to another suitable location and to remove any other constructions or buildings in the area. The petitioner must pay any arrears of lease amount. The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

In summary, the court orders pertain to various writ petitions filed by petitioners seeking renewal of their leasehold area in a Reserved Forest Area. The court has upheld the government's decision to reject the renewal of lease citing legal precedents that prohibit habitation or commercial activity in reserved forest areas. The court has also ordered the eviction of petrol and kerosene bunks and the Panchayat Union Office from the Reserved Forest Area and emphasized the need to protect Reserved Forest Areas in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court has also ordered all State Governments to immediately cease any non-forest activity within any forest without prior approval from the Central Government. The court has confirmed an earlier decision to evict the writ petitioner from premises in a Reserved Forest Area within 30 days.
