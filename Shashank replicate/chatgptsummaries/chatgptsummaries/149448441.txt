The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) filed a petition seeking to quash an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that restrained the State of Punjab and various authorities from cutting any tree in the entire state without specific permission. The petitioner argued that the order had stalled several critical and time-bound projects of public importance, causing huge loss to the government exchequer and public inconvenience. The court disposed of the writ petition in terms of the order passed by the Supreme Court in an appeal arising out of the same order passed by the learned Tribunal. The Supreme Court suspended the impugned order for a period of four months to enable the State Government to execute ongoing projects and other projects likely to be affected by the order.

The court order states that the Tribunal has the freedom to pass a new order regarding approved projects after considering any new evidence presented by the State of Punjab. The order concerning NH-71 is suspended temporarily to avoid delays in serving notice to the respondent. The petitioner can raise any legal contentions after the Tribunal receives the necessary information. The operation of the impugned order is suspended for four months to allow the petitioner to execute ongoing projects. The parties can approach the Tribunal to raise any legal contentions. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
