The court has dismissed a writ petition filed by T. Rajam @ Kaveri Kutty, upholding the order passed by the Government in respect of the vesting of lands to the share of the respective respondents. The lands in question were assigned to political sufferers and were subsequently sold to the appellant through a registered sale deed, which was subsequently cancelled by the Government. The appellant argued that the cancellation was done behind their back and that the purchaser should have been put on notice before effecting cancellation of the assignment. However, the court held that the original assignee had violated the conditions of assignment, and the competent authority had passed the cancellation order. As the assignee had not been impleaded as a party, the petitioner had no locus standi.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the ownership of a piece of land that was sold by the 7th respondent to other parties. The land was originally assigned to someone else, but the government had resumed it due to a violation of the conditions of assignment. The appellant, who had purchased the land from the original assignee, challenged the resumption order on the grounds of jurisdiction and lack of notice. However, the court found that the appellant had no locus standi to question the resumption proceedings, as the same is only between the original assignee and the government. The court also rejected the appellant's arguments that the alleged violation of principles of natural justice had occurred.

The court order states that there is no evidence linking the deceased Radhakrishnan to the lands assigned by the government, and the death certificate produced is not sufficient to prove ownership. The appellant's case is weakened by the fact that they did not implead the legal heirs of Radhakrishnan. The resumption of the lands by the government is deemed legal, and the appellant has no right to challenge it. The court directs the government to investigate the grant of patta to the 7th respondent and consider resuming the lands if the grant is not supported by records. The sale executed in favor of the appellant is deemed void, and they have no right to question the resumption. However, if the sale is bona fide, the appellant can approach the government for allotment of the lands. The writ appeal is dismissed, and there is no order as to costs.
