The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Mukesh Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them to ensure they are free of contamination. The state is also ordered to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination. The court imposes a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to impose damages or compensation on such persons. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records related to the case. The state is directed to submit a comprehensive plan for removing encroachments and preventing contamination, failing which a fine will be imposed. The District Collector of Ganga Nagar is ordered to be present with relevant records on the next hearing date. The state is also directed to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas.

The court order discusses the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and the steps being taken to mark and remove them. The court directs the state to remove all encroachments within one month and provides a list of officials who must provide assistance and monitor the removal. The court also orders the state to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to remove existing structures causing contamination of canal water. The state is directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, and a compliance report is to be filed. The court expresses concern over the state's lethargic attitude and warns of appropriate action if the order is not implemented.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The court has given multiple opportunities to the state authorities to comply with the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to remove encroachments and collect compensation from the encroachers. However, the authorities have been slow in taking action, and the court has directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and relevant records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief, as it has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if the inferior court or tribunal of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the proceedings in a manner that is contrary to the rules of natural justice.

The court order states that before approaching a writ court with an allegation that a tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, all other remedies must be exhausted. The original applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not yet been decided. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until December 31, 2016. After that, the State is free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT.
