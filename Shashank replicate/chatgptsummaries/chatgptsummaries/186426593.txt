In a recent court order, a petitioner who had applied for a retail outlet dealership at a specific location had their request denied. The Divisional Forest Officer had issued a notice to cancel the conditional 'No Objection Certificate' issued to the petitioner on the grounds that the installation of the petrol pump had affected trees of the Forest Department and plantation, and that there was already another petrol pump within a 4 km radius. 

The petitioner had prayed for the issuance of a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the orders issued by respondent no.3 asking the petitioner to deposit the amount and also asking respondent no.2 to cancel the 'No Objection Certificate' issued to the petitioner. However, the court dismissed the petition and upheld the charges imposed on the petitioner. 

This case highlights the importance of environmental concerns and the impact that businesses can have on the natural world. The court's decision to uphold the cancellation of the 'No Objection Certificate' shows that the government is taking steps to protect the environment and prevent further damage. 

It is also important to note that the court's decision was based on the fact that there was already another petrol pump within a 4 km radius. This suggests that the government is taking steps to prevent over-saturation of petrol pumps in a particular area, which can have negative effects on the environment and the local community. 

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder that businesses must take into account the impact they have on the environment and the local community. It also highlights the importance of government regulations and the role they play in protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development.
