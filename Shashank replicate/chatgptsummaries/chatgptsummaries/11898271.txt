The court order pertains to a dispute over the installation of electric transmission lines on a piece of land. The plaintiff, a private limited company, has already constructed a site for storing hazardous waste on the land, which has been leased to them by the Haryana Environmental Management Society. The defendant, the Electricity Department, has obtained technical approval and sanction from the Ministry of Power to use the land for transmission lines without acquiring it. The court notes that both projects are of national importance and that the jurisdiction of the civil court is debatable. The court sets aside the interim direction of status quo and instructs the lower appellate court to consider the issue in accordance with the law without being influenced by any statement of fact recorded in the order.

The court order pertains to two civil revision petitions filed by M/S Power Grid Corporation of India against M/S Gujarat Enviro Protection & Infrastructure Haryana(Pvt.) Ltd.
