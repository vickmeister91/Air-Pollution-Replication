The court order pertains to six different writ appeals filed by The Corporation of City of Gulbarga and The State of Karnataka against the State government and various individuals. The appeals seek to set aside an order/judgment passed by a learned single judge of the High Court of Karnataka in writ petitions related to land acquisition. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the appeals.

In one of the appeals, the court order requires the Corporation and the concerned party to settle their dispute amicably, with the concerned party retaining 14 plots of land and withdrawing all cases pending before the Civil Court and City Survey Office. The Corporation is allowed to deal with the remaining plots and open space. The concerned party is entitled to have their name entered in the Corporation records and is free to deal with the 14 plots retained by them. The order was made to resolve a long-standing litigation over the land. The order was challenged in writ petitions filed by 14 petitioners. The learned Single Judge observed that the view taken in the impugned order was based on misleading information/facts placed on record by the petitioners.

In another appeal, the court order discusses a dispute between the Corporation of City of Gulbarga and the erstwhile owner of a property, Seshagiri Rao. The Corporation agreed to let Rao retain 14 plots of land, and the Commissioner of the Corporation filed a petition to transfer the plots to Rao's name. The State Government subsequently passed an order to review the transfer, but the court found that there was no evidence of fraud and that the compromise was approved by the government. The court also found that the Corporation had taken possession of the land in question and that the acquisition was completed in 1947-48. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners who had purchased the plots from Rao.

In yet another appeal, the court order discusses a case where fraud was committed in the acquisition of land by Sri Seshagiri Rao and interested parties in the Corporation. The court found that the Corporation and the Government were misled by false information, and the acquisition was complete in 1947-48. The court also found that the principles of natural justice were not violated, and even if the petitioners were granted a hearing, it would be an empty formality. The court held that the interest of the people at large is paramount and cannot be ignored, and the petitioners cannot be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the resolution obtained by fraud. The court also referred to various judgments of the Supreme Court in support of its decision.

In another appeal, the court order discusses the principles of natural justice and the power of the government to cancel resolutions or orders passed by the Corporation. The court concludes that the principles of natural justice need not be observed in this case as the petitioners claiming interest in the property acquired it through a person who had no authority in law. The court also states that the government has the power to cancel resolutions or orders if they are in contravention of the law or prejudicial to the interest of the Corporation. The court rejects the petitioners' claim to ownership of the land and suggests that they should proceed against the landlord or the Corporation for appropriate relief.

In the final appeal, the court order allows the appeals and sets aside the previous order passed by the learned Single Judge. The order passed by the Government is confirmed. The petitioners are allowed to file proceedings for appropriate relief, but the court does not recognize any rights of the petitioners in that regard. Any such proceedings will be considered on merits in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court order deals with various disputes related to land acquisition and ownership in the city of Gulbarga. The court has heard arguments from both sides and has made decisions based on the facts and evidence presented before it. The court has also referred to various judgments of the Supreme Court in support of its decisions. The order aims to resolve long-standing litigations and disputes related to land ownership and acquisition in the city.
