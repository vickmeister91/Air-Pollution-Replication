The court order in question pertains to a case where an advocate reported no instructions on behalf of his clients, resulting in an ex parte decree. The advocate later attempted to set aside the decree using the same Vakalath, which was deemed improper as it had been withdrawn when he reported no instructions. The court upheld the decision of the lower courts, citing previous cases that equated reporting no instructions to the withdrawal of the Vakalath. The petition was dismissed with costs.

The case in question revolves around the use of a Vakalath, which is a document that authorizes an advocate to represent a client in court. In this case, the advocate in question reported no instructions on behalf of his clients, which resulted in an ex parte decree being issued against them. An ex parte decree is a legal order that is issued in the absence of one of the parties involved in the case.

The advocate later attempted to set aside the ex parte decree using the same Vakalath that had been used to represent his clients in the original case. However, the court deemed this to be improper as the Vakalath had been withdrawn when the advocate reported no instructions on behalf of his clients. This meant that the advocate no longer had the authority to represent his clients in court.

The court upheld the decision of the lower courts, citing previous cases that equated reporting no instructions to the withdrawal of the Vakalath. This means that if an advocate reports no instructions on behalf of their clients, they are effectively withdrawing their authority to represent them in court. As a result, any subsequent attempts to use the same Vakalath to represent those clients would be deemed improper.

The petition in this case was dismissed with costs, meaning that the advocate in question would be responsible for paying the legal fees associated with the case. This serves as a reminder to advocates to be diligent in their representation of clients and to ensure that they have clear instructions before proceeding with a case.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Vakalath in legal proceedings and the consequences of not properly withdrawing it when necessary. It also serves as a reminder to advocates to be diligent in their representation of clients and to ensure that they have clear instructions before proceeding with a case.
