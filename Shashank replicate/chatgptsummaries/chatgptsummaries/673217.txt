The case at hand involves a petitioner who filed a private complaint against the respondents for alleged offences under Sections 408 and 420 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The petitioner requested the Magistrate to issue summonses to the respondents to produce documents, which was rejected by the Magistrate. The petitioner then filed a petition against this order, arguing that the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court is not binding upon this Court.

The Court, however, held that the later decision of the Supreme Court is binding and that the summonses could not be issued in view of the law pronounced by the Supreme Court in Shyamlal's case. The application was dismissed.

To understand the significance of this ruling, it is important to delve into the legal background of the case. Section 408 of the IPC deals with criminal breach of trust by a clerk or servant, while Section 420 deals with cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. Section 34 of the IPC deals with acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.

The petitioner had alleged that the respondents had committed these offences by misappropriating funds and cheating the petitioner. In order to prove their case, the petitioner had requested the Magistrate to issue summonses to the respondents to produce documents.

However, the Magistrate had rejected this request, citing a decision of the Supreme Court in Shyamlal's case. In that case, the Supreme Court had held that a Magistrate cannot issue summonses to a person to produce documents in a private complaint case. The Court had reasoned that the power to issue summonses to produce documents is only available to a Magistrate in a complaint case instituted by a public servant.

The petitioner had argued that the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court in R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta had overruled the decision in Shyamlal's case. In that case, the Supreme Court had held that a Magistrate can issue summonses to a person to produce documents in a private complaint case.

However, the Court in the present case held that the decision in Shyamlal's case was still binding, as it had not been overruled by a larger bench of the Supreme Court. The Court noted that the decision in R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta had been rendered by a bench of two judges, while the decision in Shyamlal's case had been rendered by a bench of three judges.

The Court also noted that the decision in Shyamlal's case had been followed by several High Courts, and that there was no reason to depart from it. The Court held that the summonses could not be issued in view of the law pronounced by the Supreme Court in Shyamlal's case, and dismissed the application.

In conclusion, the Court's ruling in this case reaffirms the principle of stare decisis, which means that lower courts are bound by the decisions of higher courts. The Court held that the decision in Shyamlal's case was still binding, and that the subsequent decision in R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta had not overruled it. This ruling has important implications for future cases involving the power of Magistrates to issue summonses to produce documents in private complaint cases.
