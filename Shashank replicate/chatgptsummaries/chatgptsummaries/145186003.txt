The High Court has issued an order in a case involving the illegal transportation of sand and various offences registered against the owner of the vehicle involved. The owner had filed an application seeking interim custody of the vehicle, which was dismissed by the lower court. The High Court has now directed that the vehicle be released on supurdiginama, a type of custody, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions set by the High Court include the furnishing of a personal bond and a bank guarantee, as well as a prohibition on the use of the vehicle for any anti-social activities. The applicant has also been directed to produce the original registration and sale-letter of the vehicle.

The order has been sent to the trial court for compliance. This means that the trial court will need to ensure that the conditions set by the High Court are met before releasing the vehicle to the owner.

The case involves the illegal transportation of sand, which is a serious offence in many parts of the world. Sand is a valuable resource that is used in construction and other industries, and its illegal transportation can lead to environmental damage and other negative consequences.

The owner of the vehicle involved in this case had filed an application seeking interim custody of the vehicle. However, the lower court had dismissed this application, leading the owner to appeal to the High Court.

The High Court has now directed that the vehicle be released on supurdiginama, which is a type of custody that involves the transfer of possession of the vehicle to a third party. This is a common practice in cases where the ownership of a vehicle is in dispute or where there are concerns about the use of the vehicle.

The conditions set by the High Court are designed to ensure that the vehicle is not used for any illegal or anti-social activities. The personal bond and bank guarantee are intended to provide financial security in case the conditions are not met.

The requirement to produce the original registration and sale-letter of the vehicle is also significant. This is because it helps to establish the ownership of the vehicle and ensures that it is not being used illegally.

Overall, the High Court's order in this case is an important step in ensuring that the illegal transportation of sand is dealt with appropriately. By setting conditions for the release of the vehicle, the court has taken steps to prevent any further illegal activities from taking place. The order also highlights the importance of proper documentation in establishing ownership and preventing the use of vehicles for illegal purposes.
