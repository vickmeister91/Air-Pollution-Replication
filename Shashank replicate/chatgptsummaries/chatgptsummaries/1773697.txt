The recent court order pertains to a case where a mining company's lease had expired, but it continued mining operations on forest land without prior approval from the state government. The court had to decide whether the company could continue mining under a legal provision that allowed for deemed extension of the lease until the state government passed an order on renewal. The court held that the Forest Conservation Act prohibits non-forest activities on forest land without prior approval from the central government, and therefore the mining company could not continue mining without complying with this requirement.
