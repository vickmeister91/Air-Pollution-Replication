Two court orders have been discussed in the given summaries. The first case is K.S. Bhatnagar vs State & Anr. where the petitioner filed a petition to quash a complaint and summoning order against him under Section 409 read with Section 34 IPC. The complaint alleged that the petitioner had taken the original property papers of the complainant. The petitioner argued that the complaint was false and frivolous, and even if there was a failure to return the papers, it did not constitute an offense under Section 405 or 409 IPC. The court referred to previous cases and ultimately quashed the complaint and summoning order.

In the second case, the petitioner was accused of misappropriating documents related to a property. The court found that the second complaint filed by the complainant was not maintainable as it was filed during the pendency of the first complaint and did not disclose the dismissal of the first complaint. The court also noted that the complainant had failed to obtain any sanction from the Sanctioning Authority and that the prosecution of the petitioner was bad in law. The court quashed the impugned order and dismissed both complaints as false, frivolous, and unnecessary.
