The recent judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been cited as the reason for the dismissal of a writ petition challenging an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The petitioners had sought to challenge the order, but the court held that the writ petition was not maintainable due to the existence of a statutory forum for redressal of grievances.

The court observed that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. The court noted that an appeal would be maintainable under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court dismissed the writ petition and no costs were awarded.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, with the objective of providing effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment.

The dismissal of the writ petition by the court highlights the importance of statutory forums for redressal of grievances. The existence of such forums ensures that disputes are resolved in a timely and efficient manner, without the need for recourse to the courts. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures that the expertise of the statutory forum is utilized in resolving disputes.

The court's decision also underscores the need for litigants to be aware of the statutory remedies available to them. In this case, the petitioners could have appealed the order of the National Green Tribunal under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. By failing to do so, they were left with no recourse but to file a writ petition, which was ultimately dismissed by the court.

The dismissal of the writ petition also serves as a reminder of the limitations of the writ jurisdiction of the courts. While the writ jurisdiction is a powerful tool for the protection of fundamental rights, it is not a substitute for the statutory remedies available to litigants. The courts have consistently held that the writ jurisdiction should not be invoked where an alternative remedy is available to the petitioner.

In conclusion, the dismissal of the writ petition challenging the order of the National Green Tribunal highlights the importance of statutory forums for redressal of grievances and the need for litigants to be aware of the statutory remedies available to them. The decision also underscores the limitations of the writ jurisdiction of the courts and the need for litigants to exhaust all available remedies before resorting to writ petitions.
