In a recent court case, the defendants had requested that a suit for rent in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Khulna be stayed during the pendency of an appeal in the higher court. The defendants argued that the second suit must be stayed under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, as the title to the land in question was not conclusively determined in the previous suit. However, the court ruled that Section 10 did not apply as the matters in issue were different in the two suits and the section only applies to cases clearly within its language and intendment. The Rule was discharged with costs.

The case involved a dispute over the title to a piece of land, which was the subject of two separate suits. The first suit had been filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Khulna, and had resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendants. The second suit was filed in the higher court, and the defendants argued that it should be stayed under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908.

Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, provides that "no court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit is pending in the same or any other court in Bangladesh having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed."

The defendants argued that the title to the land in question was not conclusively determined in the previous suit, and therefore the second suit should be stayed under Section 10. However, the court ruled that Section 10 did not apply in this case, as the matters in issue were different in the two suits.

The court noted that the first suit was a suit for possession of the land, while the second suit was a suit for rent. The court held that the two suits were not directly and substantially in issue, and therefore Section 10 did not apply.

The court also noted that Section 10 only applies to cases clearly within its language and intendment. The court held that the present case was not such a case, and therefore Section 10 did not apply.

The court therefore discharged the Rule with costs. The defendants were ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.

In conclusion, the court ruled that Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, did not apply in this case, as the matters in issue were different in the two suits. The court held that Section 10 only applies to cases clearly within its language and intendment, and that the present case was not such a case. The Rule was discharged with costs.
