The case of M. Ganesan v. State of Tamil Nadu and Others was brought before the Madras High Court by the petitioner, M. Ganesan, who filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to ensure that no aquaculture industrial activity is carried on in the villages in Sirgazhi Taluk. The petitioner claimed that aquaculture activities carried out by respondents 5 to 8 were causing systematic destruction of prime agriculture wetlands.

The court noted that subsequent legislation had been enacted, and two of the private parties had already closed their business, while the third had obtained permission under the Coastal Aquaculture Authority Act, 2005. The court held that the petition had become infructuous and disposed of it accordingly.

The case highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the judiciary in ensuring that laws are enforced. The petitioner's concern for the destruction of prime agriculture wetlands is a valid one, and the court's recognition of the issue is commendable. However, the fact that subsequent legislation had been enacted and two of the private parties had already closed their business shows that progress is being made in addressing the issue.

The Coastal Aquaculture Authority Act, 2005, is an important piece of legislation that regulates the establishment and operation of coastal aquaculture farms in India. The act aims to ensure that aquaculture activities are carried out in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. The fact that one of the private parties had obtained permission under the act shows that the government is taking steps to regulate the industry and ensure that it operates within the bounds of the law.

Overall, the case of M. Ganesan v. State of Tamil Nadu and Others highlights the importance of environmental protection and the role of the judiciary in ensuring that laws are enforced. While the petitioner's concerns are valid, the fact that progress is being made in addressing the issue is a positive development. The Coastal Aquaculture Authority Act, 2005, is an important piece of legislation that regulates the industry and ensures that it operates in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner.
