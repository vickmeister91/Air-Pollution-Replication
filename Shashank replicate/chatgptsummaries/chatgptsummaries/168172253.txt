The Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. had filed 32 writ petitions against the order of Permanent Lok Adalat, which had allowed the complaint of residents of Kanwar Avenue Amritsar. The residents had become owners of property in the colony approved by the Municipal Corporation Authorities and had applied for the release of a temporary electric connection. The connection was granted, but the permanent connection was not released on the premise that the layout of the LD system had not been approved by the Chief Electrical Inspector.

During the hearing, the court was informed that the Punjab Pollution Control Board had issued a direction to close the project due to violation by the builders, and that certain documents were deficient. The builder had complied with some requirements and was contemplating to do so with others, and the permanent connection would be released on completion of the same.

The court dismissed the writ petitions and upheld the order of the Lok Adalat, which required the Electricity Board to provide electricity to residents of the colony. The builder had already submitted the necessary documents and was contemplating depositing any dues owed to the Electricity Board. The court also issued a direction to the Electricity Board to comply with the requirements of the builder within a month, failing which the court may take action.

The court noted that some residents had obtained an interim injunction against disconnection notices. The court order was a significant victory for the residents of Kanwar Avenue Amritsar, who had been struggling to get a permanent electric connection for their homes.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the builder had complied with some requirements and was willing to comply with others.

The court's decision was a clear indication that the rights of the residents could not be ignored, and that the Electricity Board had to comply with the requirements of the builder.
