The Madras High Court has recently passed an order in two writ petitions filed by M/s. Madura Coats Private Limited against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and other respondents. The first petition seeks to quash the impugned proceedings of the first respondent, while the second petition seeks to forbear the respondents from initiating any coercive action against the petitioner without following the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Environment (Protection) Rule, 1986 and Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016.

The petitioner, M/s. Madura Coats Private Limited, is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and exporting industrial yarns and threads. The company has a manufacturing unit in the state of Tamil Nadu, which is regulated by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). The TNPCB is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and other environmental laws in the state.

The petitioner had received a show cause notice from the TNPCB, alleging that the company had violated the provisions of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. The TNPCB had also issued a closure order, directing the petitioner to shut down its manufacturing unit. The petitioner had challenged the show cause notice and the closure order before the Madras High Court.

The Madras High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, has directed the Chairman of the TNPCB to withdraw the closure order and show cause notice issued to the petitioner. The court has also directed the respondents to proceed in accordance with the law. The court has observed that the TNPCB had not followed the due process of law while issuing the closure order and show cause notice to the petitioner.

The court has held that the TNPCB had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before issuing the closure order. The court has also held that the TNPCB had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, while issuing the show cause notice. The court has observed that the TNPCB had not conducted any inspection or analysis of the samples collected from the petitioner's manufacturing unit before issuing the show cause notice.

The court has further held that the TNPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while issuing the show cause notice. The court has observed that the show cause notice had been issued on the basis of a report submitted by a third party, without giving the petitioner an opportunity to cross-examine the author of the report. The court has held that the principles of natural justice require that the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to cross-examine the author of the report before issuing the show cause notice.

The court has also observed that the TNPCB had not followed the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Environment (Protection) Rule, 1986, while issuing the show cause notice. The court has held that the TNPCB had not given the petitioner a reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of the Act and the Rules before issuing the show cause notice.

In light of these observations, the court has directed the Chairman of the TNPCB to withdraw the closure order and show cause notice issued to the petitioner. The court has also directed the respondents to proceed in accordance with the law. The court has observed that the respondents are at liberty to proceed in accordance with the law, which includes following the due process of law and giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before taking any coercive action.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court has passed an order in two writ petitions filed by M/s. Madura Coats Private Limited against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and other respondents. The court has directed the Chairman of the TNPCB to withdraw the closure order and show cause notice issued to the petitioner. The court has also directed the respondents to proceed in accordance with the law, which includes following the due process of law and giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before taking any coercive action.
