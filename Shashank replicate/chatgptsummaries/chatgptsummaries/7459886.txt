The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by K. Senguttuvan under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct Nathella Sampath Jewelery Private Limited to deposit a sum equivalent to the money due to its investors under various promotional schemes. The petitioner has also sought a recovery mechanism for the investors who have invested their money in various gold schemes with Nathella Sampath Jewellery Private Limited. The petitioner has contended that the company has shut down its outlets and has not repaid the investors.

The court has considered the maintainability of the petition as a public interest litigation and has referred to various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on public interest litigations. The court discusses the concept of public interest litigation (PIL) and emphasizes that it should only be used for genuine public grievances and not for personal gain or political motives. The court warns against the abuse of PILs by busybodies or meddlesome interlopers and stresses the importance of verifying the credentials and intentions of the petitioner.

The court notes that the judiciary must be careful not to encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature. The order provides guidelines for the entertainment of PILs and warns that the misuse of PILs can create a bottleneck in the superior court, preventing other genuine violations of fundamental rights from being considered.

The court emphasizes that personal grudges and enmity cannot be enforced through the process of the court under Article 32 of the Constitution in the guise of public interest litigation. Public interest litigation is meant for the vindication or enforcement of fundamental rights of a group of persons or community who are not able to enforce their fundamental rights due to incapacity, poverty, or ignorance of law. The court must discourage such petitions and ensure that the course of justice is not obstructed or polluted by unscrupulous litigants invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court for personal matters.

The court must be careful in entertaining public interest litigations and reject applications of busybodies at the threshold itself. The court should filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique motives. The court must strike a balance between two conflicting interests and act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public-spirited holy men. The court must be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest, an ugly private malice, vested interest, and/or publicity seeking is not lurking. Each case has to be examined on its own facts.

The court order references a previous case where a writ petition filed by an Assistant Medical Officer was entertained by the High Court, despite being filed for personal reasons, because it brought to light malpractices in a premier university and was deemed to be a matter of public interest. The court order then states that the current writ petition, filed as a public interest litigation, cannot be maintained as the petitioner has personal interest in the matter. The petitioner is not remediless as they can appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The court dismisses the writ petition and no costs are awarded.

In summary, the court order discusses the concept of public interest litigation and emphasizes that it should only be used for genuine public grievances and not for personal gain or political motives. The court warns against the abuse of PILs by busybodies or meddlesome interlopers and stresses the importance of verifying the credentials and intentions of the petitioner.
