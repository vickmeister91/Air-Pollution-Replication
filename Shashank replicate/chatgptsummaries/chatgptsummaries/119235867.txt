In a recent case, a petitioner filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to direct the police not to harass him based on a complaint he made. The police had issued a summons to the petitioner under Section 160 and 91(1) Cr.P.C. to enquire about the complaint. The petitioner argued that the summons was illegal and that it was issued with the intention of harassing him.

The court examined the case and found that there was no illegality in the summons issued by the police. The court noted that the police had the power to issue summons under Section 160 and 91(1) Cr.P.C. to enquire about a complaint. The court also observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that the summons was issued with the intention of harassing him.

The court further noted that the petitioner had the option to approach the police and provide any information or evidence he had regarding the complaint. The court emphasized that the police had the duty to investigate any complaint and that the petitioner could not prevent the police from carrying out their duty.

Based on these observations, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner. The court held that the police had acted within their powers and that there was no illegality in the summons issued to the petitioner.

This case highlights the importance of understanding the powers of the police and the limitations of the court in interfering with their duties. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to cooperate with the police in their investigations and provide any information or evidence they may have regarding a complaint.
