The Kerala High Court recently passed two orders related to land possession disputes. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by 15 individuals claiming possession of land in Palakkad district. The court examined the definition of 'land' under the Kerala Land Assignment (Regularization of Occupations of Forest Lands prior to 1.1.1977) Special Rules, 1993 and found that the land occupied by the petitioners did not fall under the definition of 'land' as per the Special Rules. The court also noted that the Special Rules can only be applied to land transferred from the Forest Department to the Revenue Department and recommended to the Government of India for concurrence under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court found no merit in the claim made by the occupiers for assignment of the occupied land.

The second order states that occupiers of vested land cannot claim any rights to the land. The Special Rules 1993 can only be applied to identified lands mentioned in the judgment and not to any other category of land. The court's negative finding against the occupiers is strengthened by this judgment. The appeal is dismissed.
