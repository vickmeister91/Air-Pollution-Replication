The Madras High Court received a petition from P. Rengasamy, a resident of Karattampatti Village, Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District, seeking a writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash the proceedings of the first respondent, dated 14.08.2018, granting permission to the fourth respondent for quarrying stone in Survey No.63 of Karatampatti Village, Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District and for a consequential direction to the official respondents to preserve the water body, check dam, water supply system in the said survey number. The petitioner argued that the land comprised in Survey No. 63 of Karatampatti Village is a water body, but has been wrongly shown in the revenue records as a rocky terrain. The court reserved the order on 21.10.2019 and pronounced it on 07.11.2019.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner and villagers against the grant of a stone quarry lease to a fourth respondent without proper inspection and environmental impact assessment. The petitioner argues that the quarry operation will damage the water body, check dam, trees, tank bund, graveyard, and affect drinking water supply. The court has stayed the operation of the lease and granted an injunction against quarry operations until further orders. The first respondent has filed a counter affidavit stating that the lease was granted in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959.

The court order pertains to a stone quarry in Musiri Taluk, which was identified on government land and included in the tender-cum-auction process after adhering to prescribed rules. The mining plan was approved and cleared by the District Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The land in question was classified as unassessed waste dry land and had been previously used for manual quarrying, resulting in the formation of percolation ponds. The order passed in favor of the fourth respondent imposed special conditions for safety distances from nearby structures. The court sought clarification on the distance between the quarry and nearby structures, and the first respondent filed an additional counter affidavit providing details on the proposed lease area and safety distances.

The court order discusses a dispute over a proposed quarry operation on a piece of land. The petitioner argues that the land is not suitable for quarrying and that the operation would harm the environment. The respondents argue that all necessary procedures have been followed and that the quarrying operation is lawful. The court cites a notification from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, which requires environmental clearance for new projects or activities that could have an impact on the environment. The court ultimately rules in favor of the respondents, stating that all necessary procedures have been followed and that the quarrying operation can proceed.

The court order cites legal principles from previous cases, including the right to live in a pollution-free environment and the precedence of environmental protection over economic interests. The case at hand involves a dispute over whether a proposed quarry site is actually a water body, with the petitioner presenting evidence of a sluice, tank bund, and borewell. The counter affidavit from the first respondent disputes the existence of a water body and claims that any pits are temporary formations from illegal quarrying. The court must determine the true nature of the land and balance economic interests with environmental protection.

The court order discusses a case regarding the proposed quarrying operation in a land that may contain a water body. The court finds evidence of the existence of a water body, including the construction of a sluice and the presence of a bund. The court rejects the argument that the land is classified as Parai poromboke and therefore cannot be a water body. The court also notes that even if the land is rocky terrain, it can still be a water body. The court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to show the existence of a water body and that the proposed quarry site is within the prohibited distance.

The court order pertains to a case involving the grant of permission for stone quarrying in a water body in Karattampatti Village, Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District. The court found that the selection of the site itself was illegal and that the grant of permission was arbitrary and in violation of environmental laws. The court quashed the impugned order and permanently restrained the respondents from granting any permission for quarrying stone operation or light material in the land. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and public interest over economic interest.

This is a court order with the case number W.P.(MD) No.23754 of 2018 and related to W.M.P.(MD) Nos.21515, 21516, 21517, 21518 & 21849 of 2018. The order was issued on November 7, 2019 by T.S.SIVAGNANAM and R.THARANI, judges of the court. The order can be found on the website http://www.judis.nic.in.
