The National Green Tribunal received an application from social activists challenging the construction of a road from Vitthalwadi to National Highway-4 bypass, claiming that it would cause environmental, ecological, and social damage. The construction is being carried out in the river bed, and the applicants allege that it violates the Draft Development Plan, as no permission from the Irrigation Department has been taken, and the road touches the Vitthalwadi Temple and its surrounding areas, which are Grade I Heritage Buildings. The applicants requested that the construction work be stopped immediately, and the boundaries of the river be defined and marked by the local government in conjunction with the Irrigation Department and the Archaeological Department.

In another court order, a dispute over the construction of a road in Pune, India, was discussed. The applicants argue that the road is being built on submersible land within the Mutha river bed, which will obstruct the natural flow of the river and increase the risk of flooding in nearby residential areas. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has granted consent for the project, but the Irrigation Department has not given permission for construction in the river bed. The court ultimately issues a conditional No Objection Certificate for the road's construction, with several conditions to mitigate environmental and social damages.

The court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a road and retaining wall in Pune, India. The applicant argues that the construction violates environmental and ecological regulations, while the respondent claims that all necessary permissions were obtained and that the project serves a public purpose. The court notes that the Irrigation Department did not grant permission for the construction and orders that the road and retaining wall should not be constructed. The respondent argues that the road is being constructed on private land and that the river ecosystem will not be adversely affected. The court considers the arguments of both parties and ultimately rules in favor of the applicant, prohibiting the construction of the road and retaining wall.

The court order discusses a road construction project in Pune and the need to balance the economic benefits with the potential environmental damage. The court examines whether the project required environmental clearance and concludes that it did not fall under the category that required clearance. The court also addresses objections raised regarding permission from the Archaeology and Museum Directorate and the Irrigation Department. The court ultimately finds that the project can proceed with certain conditions to protect the environment and historical monuments.

In another court order, an application for permission to construct a road project from Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass was discussed. The Irrigation Department had not granted permission for the project until April 15, 2013, and the NOC was conditional. The circular dated September 21, 1989, prohibits construction in the blue line area due to the possibility of floods. The Chief Engineer of the Irrigation Department was not authorized to overrule the circular and issue an NOC for construction on the blue line. The construction work being carried out by Respondent No.1 of the project in question was not in accordance with the law.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a construction project should be allowed to continue despite not obtaining necessary clearances and permissions. The court emphasizes the importance of balancing development with environmental protection, and the concept of sustainable development. The court must exercise judicial discretion to strike a balance between the two, and ensure that development does not cause irreparable damage to the environment. The court cites various principles and judgments to support its decision-making process. Ultimately, the court must decide whether to permit the completion of the project subject to certain conditions or to order its demolition and abandonment.

The court order emphasizes the principle of sustainable development, which includes the precautionary principle and the principle of proportionality. The court states that while development is important, it should not compromise environmental interests. The burden of proof is on the developer to show that their actions are environmentally benign. The court also mentions the doctrine of public trust, which affirms the state's duty to protect public property for public purposes. The court applies these principles to a specific case involving the construction of a road in a river bed and highlights the potential environmental disadvantages of such construction.

In another court order, a proposed road project that would encroach on flood plains and cause environmental damage was discussed. The court imposes conditions on the project, including constructing the road on elevated pillars within the blue line, removing debris, undertaking massive plantation, and preventing unauthorized constructions. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and ecology and imposes these conditions in the interest of public safety and the constitutional mandate to safeguard and protect the environment. The application is partly allowed with the directions stated, and the parties are left to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed various disputes over road construction projects in Pune, India, and the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The courts emphasized the principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, and proportionality, and the burden of proof was on the developers to show that their actions were environmentally benign. The courts imposed conditions on the projects to mitigate environmental and social damages and protect public safety and the constitutional mandate to safeguard and protect the environment. The courts also highlighted the potential environmental disadvantages of constructing roads in river beds and flood plains and prohibited such construction in some cases.
