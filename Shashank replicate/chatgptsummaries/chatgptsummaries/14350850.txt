In a recent case, a renowned golfer filed an application to quash an order retaining his passport in a wildlife protection case. The court heard the case and found that the Forest Officials had falsely implicated the applicant and that no evidence had been recovered from him or his car. The court also noted that the complaint had been filed under Section 55 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and that the trial court had no authority to impound the passport.

The court allowed the application and quashed the order, directing the passport to be handed over to the applicant. However, the opposite party was allowed to approach the Passport Authority for impounding the passport in accordance with the law.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that evidence is properly collected before implicating someone in a crime. In this case, the court found that the Forest Officials had falsely implicated the applicant, which is a serious violation of justice.

The court's decision to quash the order and direct the passport to be handed over to the applicant is a clear indication that justice has been served. However, the court also recognized the importance of following the law and allowed the opposite party to approach the Passport Authority for impounding the passport in accordance with the law.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder that justice must be served, but it must also be done in accordance with the law. The court's decision to quash the order and direct the passport to be handed over to the applicant is a step in the right direction, but it is important to ensure that all parties involved follow due process and respect the law.
