The first court order pertains to a case where a person died due to electrocution while operating a motor pump in an agriculture field. The legal representative of the deceased filed a claim for relief under the Public Liability Insurance Act, which was rejected by the Collector on the grounds of negligence. The court examined whether the Collector was justified in rejecting the claim and concluded that the use of electricity is a hazardous substance and falls under the ambit of the Act. The court also noted that the Act provides for relief in cases of accidents while handling hazardous substances, and the use of electricity falls under this definition. Therefore, the court held that the Collector was not justified in rejecting the claim and ordered relief to be granted to the legal representative of the deceased.

The court order highlights the importance of the Public Liability Insurance Act in providing relief to victims of accidents involving hazardous substances. The Act defines hazardous substances as any substance or preparation which is defined as hazardous under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and includes any substance which may cause harm to human beings, other living creatures, plants, microorganisms, property, or the environment. The use of electricity is considered a hazardous substance under the Act, and any accident resulting from its use is eligible for relief under the Act.

The court also notes that the Collector's rejection of the claim on the grounds of negligence is not justified. The Act provides for relief in cases of accidents involving hazardous substances, regardless of whether the accident was due to any wrongful act or neglect. The court's decision reinforces the principle that the use of hazardous substances carries inherent risks, and those risks must be accounted for in providing relief to victims of accidents.

The second court order discusses liability for death, injury, or damage resulting from an accident. The owner of the property where the accident occurred is liable to provide relief as specified in the Schedule, and the claimant does not need to prove that the accident was due to any wrongful act or neglect. The court cites the case of Rylands v. Fletcher to establish the principle of strict liability for hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, regardless of negligence or fault. The court orders the respondent to pay the claimant as per the Schedule within 30 days, with interest.

The court order highlights the principle of strict liability for hazardous or inherently dangerous activities. The principle holds that those who engage in such activities are liable for any harm caused, regardless of whether they were negligent or at fault. The court cites the case of Rylands v. Fletcher, which established this principle in English law. The principle has been adopted in Indian law as well, and the court's decision reinforces its importance in providing relief to victims of accidents.

The court also notes that the claimant does not need to prove that the accident was due to any wrongful act or neglect. This is because the liability for accidents resulting from hazardous or inherently dangerous activities is strict, and the focus is on the activity itself rather than the conduct of those engaged in it. The court's decision reinforces the importance of this principle in providing relief to victims of accidents.

In conclusion, both court orders highlight the importance of providing relief to victims of accidents involving hazardous substances or inherently dangerous activities. The Public Liability Insurance Act provides for such relief in cases of accidents involving hazardous substances, and the principle of strict liability applies in cases of accidents resulting from inherently dangerous activities. The court's decisions reinforce these principles and emphasize the need to account for the risks associated with such activities in providing relief to victims.
