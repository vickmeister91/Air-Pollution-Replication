The court order pertains to the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, which was enacted to acquire forest lands for agrarian reform without providing compensation to the owners. The Act was challenged in court, but ultimately upheld. However, the forest lands have not been assigned as contemplated by the Act, and the enactment of the Forest (Conservation) Act has made it impossible to achieve the Act's objectives. The petitioners seek a declaration that the Kerala Act is unconstitutional and a direction to restore the private forests to their erstwhile owners.

The court considers whether the Act is a measure of agrarian reform or a mere measure of expropriation of private property. The court cites the opinion of Krishna Iyer, J. in Gwalior Rayons to emphasize that the court will closely study the substance of the statutory proposal and not its mere outward form to determine whether it is a scheme of agrarian reform or a verbal subterfuge. The court notes that the Act was enacted to acquire forest lands for agrarian reform without providing compensation to the owners. The court observes that the Act does not provide for any compensation to the owners of the forest lands, and that the acquisition of the lands is not for any public purpose. The court concludes that the Act is a measure of expropriation of private property and not a measure of agrarian reform.

The court discusses the requirements for agrarian reform and the acquisition of forest lands for this purpose. It states that the property itself must be acquired for carrying out agrarian reform, not just the income from the property. The court also addresses concerns about the government potentially using the forest lands for revenue without implementing agrarian reform, stating that legal action can be taken if the government fails to carry out the provisions of the statute.

The court dismisses writ petitions and upholds a previous decision regarding the ownership of leased land. The order also discusses an ordinance that extended the period of limitation for the State to apply for review of judgments related to private forest lands. The court notes that the ordinance was enacted to provide relief to the State in cases where it had failed to apply for review within the prescribed period. The court observes that the ordinance does not affect the rights of the parties to the litigation, and that it does not confer any new rights on the State.

The court order discusses a review petition filed by the State of Kerala to review a judgment related to private forests. The court can review its order on three grounds, including failure to produce relevant data or other particulars. The State's review petition was based on this ground, but the court found that the State did not provide any new data or particulars that were not already presented in the original appeal. Therefore, the court set aside the impugned judgment and restored the judgment of the Division Bench. The validity of successive ordinances was not considered. No costs were awarded.

In conclusion, the court order discusses the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, which was enacted to acquire forest lands for agrarian reform without providing compensation to the owners. The court considers whether the Act is a measure of agrarian reform or a mere measure of expropriation of private property and concludes that it is the latter.
