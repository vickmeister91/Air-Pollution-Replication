The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Susetha, a resident of Thoraipakkam, against the Union of India and various state authorities. The petitioner sought to quash a tender notification issued by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board for the construction of residential flats in Survey No. 403/2,3,4,5,6 at Okkiam Thoraipakkam Village. The petitioner argued that the proposed construction was impermissible in the Coastal Regulation Zone and would cause irreparable damage to the eco-system. The state authorities contested the petitioner's claims and argued that the land was not a marsh/swamp and that the construction of slum tenements had been approved by the CMDA and had received environmental clearance. The court appointed an Expert Committee to determine whether the construction would lead to waterlogging and aggravate the ecological balance of the area.

The court order discusses a dispute over the construction of housing on land in Tamil Nadu. The court notes that the Coastal Zone Management Plan prepared by the coastal state is the relevant plan for identifying and classifying Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas. The court also considers arguments from both sides regarding the nature of the land and the legality of the construction. The petitioner argues that the state has flouted rules and regulations, while the respondents argue that the petitioner has filed the writ petition with a mala fide intention. The court cites previous judgments on public interest litigation and the need to balance development with environmental protection. Ultimately, the court does not come to a final decision on the matter.

The court order discusses a writ petition filed under Public Interest Litigation guidelines issued by the Honourable Apex Court. The petitioner argues that the proposed construction by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board is illegal as it falls within the Coastal Regulatory Zone. The court examines the material documents and maps provided by both parties to determine whether the proposed area falls within the prohibited zone. The court notes that the subject survey Nos.403/2,3,4,5 and 6 of Okkiam Thoraipakkam village are situated at a distance of about 13 km. East from Velachery-Pallikarnai swamp and the area termed as 'Okkiam Maduvu' is situated at about a distance of 3 km. from the subject matter land. The court also notes that to the South of the proposed site of construction, in S.Nos.403/5 and 6, S.No.403/2 situates, wherein already 15,000 tenements were constructed by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance, most of which are already occupied by the beneficiaries. The court examines various judgments and arguments made by both parties and lists the points that arise for consideration in this writ petition.

The court order discusses a case regarding the construction of tenements in Okkiam Thoraipakkam Kannagi Nagar. The petitioner claimed that the proposed site was a prohibited area due to its proximity to the coast and that the land was marshy and a water body. However, the court found that the area was completely developed and not within the prohibited limits. The court also emphasized the duty of the state to provide clean and hygienic living conditions to its citizens, not just shelters. The court directed the state and the Slum Clearance Board to attend to the basic needs and requirements of the residents of the area, including providing regular water supply and addressing the law and order situation. The court also discussed the classification of the land as assessed waste wetland and rejected the findings of an expert committee that had exceeded its jurisdiction. Finally, the court considered the definition of a marsh and found that the subject land was not a marshy land.

The court order concludes that the proposed area for the construction of additional tenements by the Tamil Nadu State Slum Clearance Board does not fall within the prohibited zone and is not a marshy land, water body, or backwater area. The court also criticizes the Expert Committee appointed by the First Bench of the Court for over-stretching its hands and rendering recommendations and conclusions that are not relevant to the issue at hand. The writ petition filed by the petitioner lacks bonafides, and the court dismisses it. However, the State Government and the Slum Clearance Board are directed to attend to the basic needs and requirements of the residents of the already existing area of Kannagi Nagar and the surrounding areas.
