The court order pertains to three cases involving disputes over the right of tenants to purchase agricultural land from landlords. The cases revolve around the interpretation of provisions contained in sections 32-F and 32-G of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1948 and the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands Act.

In the first case, the tenant failed to exercise his right to purchase the land within the specified period, and the purchase became ineffective. The landlord, who was a minor at the time of the tillers' day, approached the Agricultural Lands Tribunal to declare the purchase ineffective and order summary eviction of the tenant. The tribunal upheld the landlord's claim, and the tenant appealed to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal, and the tenant approached the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Agricultural Lands Tribunal and the High Court. The court held that the tenant had failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of giving an intimation to the landlord within the prescribed period under sub-section (1A) of Section 32-F. The failure to comply with this requirement resulted in the tenant having failed to avail the right to purchase conferred on him. The court also rejected the argument that the provisions of sub-section (1A) of section 32-F are only directory in nature and not mandatory.

In the second case, the court discussed the provisions of section 32-F of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands Act, which confers the right of purchase of land on tenants. The tenant had failed to give an intimation to the landlord within the prescribed period under sub-section (1A) of Section 32-F. The landlord approached the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, which ordered the summary eviction of the tenant under section 32-P(1) of the Act. The tenant appealed to the High Court, which upheld the order of the tribunal. The tenant then approached the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court and the Agricultural Lands Tribunal. The court held that the requirement for the tenant to give an intimation to the landlord within the prescribed period under sub-section (1A) of Section 32-F is mandatory in nature. The failure to comply with this requirement results in the tenant having failed to avail the right to purchase conferred on him. The court also upheld the summary eviction of the tenant under section 32-P(1) of the Act.

In the third case, the court found no legal issues with the High Court's judgment and dismissed the appeal without any orders for costs. The case involved a minor landlord and non-compliance of a specific section.

In all three cases, the court emphasized the mandatory nature of the requirement for the tenant to give an intimation to the landlord within the prescribed period under sub-section (1A) of Section 32-F. The failure to comply with this requirement results in the tenant having failed to avail the right to purchase conferred on him. The court also upheld the summary eviction of the tenant under section 32-P(1) of the Act.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of complying with the mandatory requirements of the law. Tenants must give an intimation to the landlord within the prescribed period under sub-section (1A) of Section 32-F to avail the right to purchase agricultural land. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in the tenant losing the right to purchase and facing summary eviction under section 32-P(1) of the Act.
