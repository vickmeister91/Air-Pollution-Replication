The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues of water pollution and encroachment on canals in the state of Rajasthan, India. The first order relates to a civil writ petition filed by Manjeet Kaur and Gurdev Singh against the State of Rajasthan and various water resource authorities. The petitioners raised concerns about the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially heard by the Rajasthan High Court, which issued several directions. However, the case was later transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication.

The NGT passed various orders, directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances into the canal and to remove platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court order also mentions the transfer of another related case from the High Court to the NGT.

The second court order pertains to the pollution caused in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal and Ganga Nahar itself. The State has been directed to come out with comprehensive short-term and long-term schemes to render the canal and its distributories free of encroachments on the water bodies and consequent contamination in a given time frame. The State Pollution Control Board has been directed to collect water samples from the distributories and potable water rendered therefrom, analyze the same, and place before the court the analysis reports. The court has also directed the State/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found throwing waste or contaminating any distributory or canal water in any manner whatsoever per incidence and recover the same from such person by invoking the polluter pays principle. The case has been listed for the next hearing on 9th October 2015.

The third court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state government was also directed to issue notices to persons causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report was to be filed by January 29, 2016. The court further directed the state government to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, failing which appropriate action would be taken.

The fourth court order ordered the removal of structures causing contamination of canal water and directed the State to file a compliance report. The Chief Engineer's affidavit revealed that the government had not taken all necessary actions, including collecting compensation from encroachers. The court gave the State another opportunity to respond and scheduled a hearing for further consideration. In a separate case, the court directed the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal to provide information on the removal of encroachments and penalties for polluting the water. The court suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The court also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued.

The fifth court order states that even if an appeal or revision is available, a writ court can be approached if an inferior court or tribunal has committed an error that cannot be cured by other remedies. However, if the inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, the doctrine of alternative remedy may be ignored. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the issue was within the jurisdiction of the tribunal and that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 was efficacious. The writ petition was dismissed with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT after December 31, 2016.

In summary, these court orders all relate to issues of water pollution and encroachment on canals in Rajasthan, India. The courts have directed the state government to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canals and to remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The courts have also imposed penalties on individuals found to be contaminating the water and have suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The courts have emphasized the importance of complying with their directions and have warned of appropriate action if the state government fails to do so.
