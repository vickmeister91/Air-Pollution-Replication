The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by two individuals seeking a declaration that the 5th respondent has no authority to conduct public hearing under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011. They also seek to quash certain notices and issuance of a direction requiring the 3rd respondent to prepare the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan of Kerala. The court heard arguments from various parties and addressed objections raised regarding the public hearing process and the competence of the Pollution Control Board in conducting it. The court ultimately found that the grievance with regard to Thiruvananthapuram District had been redressed and that the Pollution Control Board had been entrusted with a limited scope of work.

The court has ordered that the task of public hearing for the KCZMA be entrusted to the Kerala State Pollution Control Board due to a lack of manpower. The Pollution Control Board's scope of work is limited to recording objections and suggestions made at the public hearing and making them available to the KCZMA. The court finds that this arrangement does not violate any notification and is supported by principles outlined in a previous court case.
