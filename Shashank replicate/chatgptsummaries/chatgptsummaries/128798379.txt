The court order pertains to three different cases, each with its unique set of circumstances and legal issues. The first case concerns the establishment of forest check gates for the collection of compensatory fees from trucks transporting minerals in unclassified forests under the jurisdiction of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council. The second case deals with mining activities in Meghalaya and the need for a comprehensive scheme and fund for reclamation to rectify damage caused to the environment. The third case discusses the parameters for invoking the review jurisdiction under Order 47 CPC.

In the first case, the court dismissed the review petition filed by the State of Meghalaya and private individuals against a judgment and order passed in a writ petition. The writ petition concerned the establishment of forest check gates for the collection of compensatory fees from trucks transporting minerals in unclassified forests under the jurisdiction of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council. The review petitioners sought to modify or review the judgment and order, but the court dismissed the petitions, citing various legal precedents and the need to comply with statutory provisions.

The court held that the review jurisdiction is limited to correcting a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for any other sufficient reason. The court cannot rehear a dispute because a party did not highlight all aspects of the case or argue them more forcefully. The court can only review a decision for patent error. The scope for exercise of review jurisdiction is provided in Section 114 and Order XLVII Rule 1 of the CPC. The court can deal with issues not directly impugned in the writ petition while passing the judgment if the grounds and pleadings of the writ petition warrant the directions. The court can pass a judgment or grant relief even in the absence of a specific prayer.

In the second case, the court discussed a writ petition regarding mining activities in Meghalaya and the need for a comprehensive scheme and fund for reclamation to rectify damage caused to the environment. The court dismissed the writ petition and directed that all mining activities, except those with existing licenses or lease deeds, must stop and future mining activities must consult with the CEC, draw a comprehensive scheme, and create a fund for reclamation. The court also discussed the unique land tenure system in Meghalaya and the economic impact of the cessation of quarrying activities.

The court considered the scope of review jurisdiction and cited various judgments to clarify that review is not an appeal in disguise and can only be exercised for correction of a mistake, not to substitute a view. The court modified the impugned judgment to a limited extent and declined to consider the prayer for review of certain directions. Both review petitions were disposed of with limited indulgence.

In the third case, the court discussed the parameters for invoking the review jurisdiction under Order 47 CPC. The court can make an order as it thinks fit, but the review jurisdiction is limited to correcting a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for any other sufficient reason. The court cannot rehear a dispute because a party did not highlight all aspects of the case or argue them more forcefully. The court can only review a decision for patent error.

The court held that the scope for exercise of review jurisdiction is provided in Section 114 and Order XLVII Rule 1 of the CPC. The court can deal with issues not directly impugned in the writ petition while passing the judgment if the grounds and pleadings of the writ petition warrant the directions. The court can pass a judgment or grant relief even in the absence of a specific prayer. The court modified the impugned judgment to a limited extent and declined to consider the prayer for review of certain directions. Both review petitions were disposed of with limited indulgence.

In conclusion, the court order discusses three different cases, each with its unique set of circumstances and legal issues. The court clarified the scope for exercise of review jurisdiction and cited various judgments to emphasize that review is not an appeal in disguise and can only be exercised for correction of a mistake, not to substitute a view. The court also discussed the need for a comprehensive scheme and fund for reclamation to rectify damage caused to the environment and the economic impact of the cessation of quarrying activities. The court modified the impugned judgment to a limited extent and declined to consider the prayer for review of certain directions. Both review petitions were disposed of with limited indulgence.
