The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Sukhdeo Dangi, who is accused of cutting trees in a forest area in violation of the Indian Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleges that 43 pieces of logs were recovered from the place of occurrence and that Dangi was seen cutting trees with others. Dangi's counsel argues that there is no mention of his involvement in the offence report and that he has been in custody since May 4, 2018.

After hearing both sides, the court grants bail to Dangi on the condition that he furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of the same amount each, and deposits Rs. 10,000 in the office of the D.F.O., Wild Life Division, Hazaribagh, producing the receipt at the time of filing his bail bonds.

The court's decision to grant bail to Dangi is based on several factors. First, the court notes that Dangi has been in custody for a significant period of time, since May 4, 2018. This suggests that he is not a flight risk and is unlikely to abscond if released on bail. Second, the court takes into account the fact that there is no mention of Dangi's involvement in the offence report. This suggests that the prosecution's case against him may not be strong. Finally, the court imposes several conditions on Dangi's bail, including the requirement that he deposit a sum of money with the Wild Life Division. This is intended to ensure that Dangi complies with the conditions of his bail and does not abscond.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Dangi is a balanced one that takes into account the various factors at play in the case. While the prosecution has alleged that Dangi was involved in cutting trees in a forest area in violation of the law, the court has found that there may be some doubt as to his involvement. At the same time, the court has taken steps to ensure that Dangi complies with the conditions of his bail and does not abscond.
