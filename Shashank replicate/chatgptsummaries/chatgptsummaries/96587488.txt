The three court orders pertain to cases filed under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, for illegal trade and possession of animal articles. The first case involves four accused persons who were found in possession of wildlife articles during a raid conducted by the Wildlife Inspector. An FIR was registered, and the complainant examined six witnesses. However, the court found that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. As a result, two of the accused were acquitted, while proceedings against one were abated, and one was discharged.

In the second case, the accused were found in possession of wildlife articles, including leopard nails and jackal nails. The prosecution argued that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt based on the testimony of witnesses and identification of the accused and case property. However, the defense argued that the accused were falsely implicated, and there were material contradictions in the statements of witnesses. The court referred to relevant provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and noted that the case was initiated at the instance of PFA activists. However, the court did not provide a final verdict in the order.

The third case involves a raid conducted by a team at the instance of PFA activists. The accused were charged under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the members of the raiding party have given contradictory and incorrect versions of the proceedings, and there is no explanation for the said contradiction of the time period of conducting the raid. The court finds that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused are acquitted.
