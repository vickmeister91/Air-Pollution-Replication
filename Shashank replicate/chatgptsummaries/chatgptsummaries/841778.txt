The court order pertains to seven revision petitions filed against an order passed by the Civil Judge in Jaipur. The plaintiffs had filed a suit for permanent injunction and declaration, seeking to restrain the defendants from interfering in their mining activity. The court dismissed the application for temporary injunction but later passed an order directing the defendants to allow the plaintiffs to remove machinery and minerals already excavated but lying on the mining land in dispute within seven days. The State Government filed revision petitions against this order, citing the directions given by the Supreme Court in T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India, which required prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest.

The court examined the impugned order and the legal position and concluded that the plaintiffs were rightly permitted to remove machinery and excavated minerals lying over their respective mining lease areas within seven days, in consonance with the Mineral Rules of 1980. The court upheld the impugned orders with slight modification, allowing for a reasonable amount of time for the lease holder to remove their machinery and minerals from the disputed site.

The court order requires the removal of minerals within 15 days, after which they will become property of the state and can be sold. The lease holder must remove all extracted minerals within 15 days of lease termination or they will be forfeited to the government. The court's decision is in line with the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, which state that the lease holder is responsible for the removal of minerals from the leased area.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the removal of minerals from disputed mining areas. The court has upheld the rights of the lease holder to remove machinery and minerals from their respective mining lease areas within a reasonable time frame. The court has also emphasized the importance of adhering to the Mineral Rules and the Mineral Concession Rules, which provide a framework for the extraction and removal of minerals from leased areas.

The court's decision is also in line with the Supreme Court's directions in T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India, which require prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. The court has taken into account the environmental concerns raised by the State Government and has ensured that the removal of minerals is done in a manner that is in consonance with the law and does not harm the environment.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the seven revision petitions filed against the order passed by the Civil Judge in Jaipur clarifies the legal position on the removal of minerals from disputed mining areas. The court has upheld the rights of the lease holder to remove machinery and minerals from their respective mining lease areas within a reasonable time frame, while also ensuring that the removal is done in a manner that is in consonance with the law and does not harm the environment. The court's decision is significant as it provides clarity on the legal framework for the extraction and removal of minerals from leased areas.
