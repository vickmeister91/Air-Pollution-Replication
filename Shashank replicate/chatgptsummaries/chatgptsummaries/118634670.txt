The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Krishan Kumar Mawai and Hem Singh Bharana in a criminal complaint case filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Era Infra Engineering Ltd. and others under Sections 37 and 38 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that the petitioners had already appeared before the trial court and were only required to face trial, and that sending them to custody would not serve any useful purpose. The court accepted both petitions and made the interim bail granted to the petitioners absolute.

The case was filed against M/s Era Infra Engineering Ltd. and others for allegedly violating the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed a criminal complaint against the accused, including Krishan Kumar Mawai and Hem Singh Bharana, for causing air pollution by burning waste material in the open. The complaint was filed under Sections 37 and 38 of the Act, which deal with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act.

Krishan Kumar Mawai and Hem Singh Bharana had approached the Punjab-Haryana High Court seeking anticipatory bail in the case. The court had granted interim bail to the petitioners and had directed them to appear before the trial court. The court had also directed the trial court to consider the bail application of the petitioners on its own merits.

The petitioners had contended that they were innocent and had not violated any provisions of the Act. They had also contended that they had already appeared before the trial court and were only required to face trial. They had further contended that sending them to custody would not serve any useful purpose.

The Punjab-Haryana High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the petitioners had already appeared before the trial court and were only required to face trial. The court also found that sending them to custody would not serve any useful purpose. The court, therefore, accepted both petitions and made the interim bail granted to the petitioners absolute.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Krishan Kumar Mawai and Hem Singh Bharana has been welcomed by their supporters. They have hailed the decision as a victory for justice and have expressed hope that the trial court will also consider their case on its own merits.

The case highlights the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act in protecting the environment and the health of the people. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution and lays down the penalties for contravention of its provisions. The Act also provides for the establishment of State Pollution Control Boards to implement its provisions.

The case also highlights the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of the citizens. The judiciary plays a crucial role in ensuring that justice is done and that the rights of the citizens are protected. The decision of the Punjab-Haryana High Court to grant anticipatory bail to Krishan Kumar Mawai and Hem Singh Bharana is a testament to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
