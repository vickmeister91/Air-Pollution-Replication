The Supreme Court of India recently issued a final order in the case of Larsen & Toubro Ltd. v. The State of Bihar and Ors. The petitioner, Larsen & Toubro Ltd., had secured a turnkey contract from Indian Oil Corporation Limited and was registered as a dealer in commercial tax. The petitioner submitted their books of accounts and other details to finalize the assessment for the period under the Bihar Finance Act and the Central Sales Tax Act. The petitioner claimed that the demands made by the taxing officer were illegal and contrary to law.

The court referred to the history of legislation and the definition of works contract and gross turnover under the Bihar Finance Act. The court also noted that the property in goods when passed in a works contract, the works contractor transfers the property and virtually effect a sale of goods and is liable to tax under the tax law. The court discussed the taxation of works contracts and the deductions that can be made from the taxable turnover of a dealer. The Supreme Court has ruled that the value of goods involved in the execution of a works contract on which tax is leviable must exclude charges for supply of labor and services, and that the value of goods must be determined at the time of incorporation into the works.

The court also ruled that the State legislature cannot impose tax on sales in the course of Inter-State trade or commerce, outside sales, or sales in the course of import and export. The court also discussed the deductibility of goods not taxable under certain sections of the Central Sales Tax Act and goods exempt from tax under state sales tax legislation. The court also ruled that certain provisions of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules and the Bihar Finance Act were unconstitutional and void.

The court order discusses the issue of deductions in relation to the amount of labor and other charges in the Bihar Sales Tax Act. The court finds that while Rule 13A provides an alternative mode of assessment, it does not prescribe the deductions in relation to any other charges. The court also notes that Sub-clause (i) of Clause (a) of Section 21 (1) clearly provides two distinct and defined items, one being labor charges while the other is any other charges. The court concludes that when the law requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it must be so done, and the State cannot simply provide the manner and extent relating to labor charges and go in hibernation.

The court order states that when a law requires something to be done in a particular manner, it must be done that way. The court observed that the State Government did not have any room to have a leverage in its favor or play the game. The court also stated that the liability of the dealer shall survive and continue, and he would be liable to be taxed after the provisions are made workable. The assessment orders were quashed, and no recovery proceedings can be initiated against the petitioners nor any coercive action can be taken against them. The court also observed that the assessing officer did not act fairly and that the two assessment orders were passed in a bad manner. Both the petitions were allowed, and there shall be no order as to costs.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India issued a final order in the case of Larsen & Toubro Ltd. v. The State of Bihar and Ors.
