The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioners sought the quashing of a complaint case filed against them under Sections 32 and 33 of the Forest Act, 1927 read with Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioners argued that the activity they were carrying out was part of a scheme notified by the government and thus, prior sanction was required before any prosecution could be initiated against them. The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint case and summoning order.

The court cited Section 197(1) Cr.P.C. which mandates that in case a public servant is required to be prosecuted for an offence allegedly committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties, cognizance shall only be taken by the Court after previous sanction of the concerned State Government. The court held that the petitioners were acting in their official capacity as employees of the Forest Department and were carrying out the activities as part of a scheme notified by the government. Therefore, prior sanction was required before any prosecution could be initiated against them.

The court also noted that the scheme in question was aimed at promoting afforestation and conservation of forests, which is a matter of public interest. The court held that the petitioners were acting in the discharge of their official duties and were not acting with any malafide intention. Therefore, the court held that the complaint case and summoning order were liable to be quashed.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of prior sanction in cases where public servants are required to be prosecuted for offences allegedly committed while acting in the discharge of their official duties. The court's decision also highlights the need to balance the interests of public servants with the interests of the public at large.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development as it provides clarity on the issue of prior sanction in cases involving public servants. The court's decision also underscores the importance of promoting afforestation and conservation of forests, which is a matter of public interest. Overall, the court's decision is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that public servants are held accountable for their actions while also ensuring that the interests of the public at large are protected.
