The case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Bajrang Lal Gupta under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Special Judge, CBI Cases, Jodhpur in Criminal Case No.10/2012. Gupta is facing trial for various offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 477-A IPC and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 

Gupta had moved an application before the trial court with a prayer for summoning communication transpired between the sanctioning authority and the CBI. However, the trial court dismissed the said application while observing that the communication sought to be summoned by the petitioner is not desirable for just decision of the case. Gupta challenged the order before the High Court, which refused to interfere in the matter.

The court has granted prosecution sanction against Gupta and has dismissed their criminal misc. petition and stay petition, stating that there is no reason for interference in the case. The court also mentions that a previous case is not helpful to Gupta's situation.

It is important to note that Gupta is facing serious charges under the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The charges include cheating, forgery, using forged documents, and criminal conspiracy. These charges are not to be taken lightly and require a thorough investigation and a fair trial.

Gupta's application for summoning communication between the sanctioning authority and the CBI may have been dismissed by the trial court, but it is important to understand the reasoning behind the dismissal. The trial court observed that the communication sought by Gupta is not desirable for a just decision of the case. This suggests that the communication may not be relevant to the case or may not have any bearing on the charges against Gupta.

The High Court's refusal to interfere in the matter further supports the trial court's decision. The court has granted prosecution sanction against Gupta, which means that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial. The dismissal of Gupta's criminal misc. petition and stay petition also suggests that there is no merit to his claims.

It is important to ensure that justice is served in this case. The charges against Gupta are serious and require a fair trial. The court's decision to grant prosecution sanction against Gupta suggests that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial. It is now up to the court to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and that justice is served.
