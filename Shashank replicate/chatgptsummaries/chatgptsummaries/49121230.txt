In the first court order, the petitioner had filed an application for rectification of a judgment and decree dated 04.05.2016. The petitioner company had been transferred to M/s. Anant Raj Projects Limited during the pendency of the petition, but no amended memo of parties was filed due to a bonafide error. The court exercised powers under Section 152 and 151 CPC and rectified the judgment by correcting the memo of parties as per the amended memo filed on record. The corrected judgment was uploaded on the internet, and the decree sheet was also amended/corrected suitably. The file was consigned to the record room.

Moving on to the second court order, it pertains to a land acquisition case where the petitioner is seeking enhanced compensation for their land. The petitioner argues that their land has great commercial value due to its location and availability of amenities. However, the court finds that the evidence presented by the petitioner is insufficient to prove their claim and relies on the fair market value determined in a similar case. The court denies the petitioner's claim for enhanced compensation.

Finally, the court has fixed the market value of the land at Rs. 31,733.59 per sq. meter, which is an enhancement of Rs. 10,833.59 per sq. meter from the original compensation amount. The petitioner is also entitled to an additional amount of 12% per annum from the date of notification until the date of possession, as well as interest at the rate of 9% per annum for the first year and 15% per annum for the subsequent year until the entire payment of compensation is made. The Land Acquisition Collector has been instructed to deposit the balance amount immediately to avoid further burden upon the Government Exchequer.

In summary, the first court order dealt with the rectification of a judgment and decree, where the court exercised its powers under Section 152 and 151 CPC to correct the memo of parties as per the amended memo filed on record. The second court order pertained to a land acquisition case where the petitioner was seeking enhanced compensation for their land, but the court denied their claim due to insufficient evidence. Finally, the court fixed the market value of the land at Rs. 31,733.59 per sq. meter and awarded the petitioner an additional amount of 12% per annum from the date of notification until the date of possession, as well as interest at the rate of 9% per annum for the first year and 15% per annum for the subsequent year until the entire payment of compensation is made. The Land Acquisition Collector has been instructed to deposit the balance amount immediately to avoid further burden upon the Government Exchequer.
