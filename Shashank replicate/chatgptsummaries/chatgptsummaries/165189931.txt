The Gauhati High Court recently heard three cases involving Star Cement Ltd, Raksha Cements Pvt. Ltd, and A.G. Cement LLP against the State of Assam and various government officials. The cases relate to environmental and forest clearances for cement plants in Assam. The court order lists the parties involved and their addresses, as well as the advocates representing them.

The court order pertains to three writ petitions challenging the closure notices issued by the State respondents to close down cement manufacturing industrial units of the petitioners on the ground that they are situated within 10 km radius from the boundary of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary. The petitioners contend that they had obtained necessary clearances prior to the commencement of production and that there was no eco-sensitive zone defined and notified in and around Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary. The court admitted the case for hearing and directed the interim order to be continued. The matter raises issues of considerable public importance, and a balance needs to be struck between protecting the ecology and preventing further environmental degradation and the need for increased industrial activity and economic growth.

The court order pertains to a case where industrial units located within 10 km of the boundaries of a wildlife sanctuary were issued closure notices. The petitioner argued that there was no Supreme Court order prohibiting mining activities within 10 km of the boundaries of national parks or wildlife sanctuaries. The court referred to a previous judgment and clarified that there was no such prohibition. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had issued a notification in 2017 prohibiting new industries and expansion of existing polluting industries in eco-sensitive zones, but not existing industries. The court considered the arguments of all parties and examined relevant materials before making its decision.

The court order pertains to the notification of an eco-sensitive zone in the Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over an area of 109.99 square kilometers. The notification prohibits the establishment of new polluting industries within the eco-sensitive zone and lists activities to be prohibited or regulated. However, existing industries set up before the notification are not affected. The court has set aside closure notices issued to industrial units within the eco-sensitive zone, stating that the grounds on which the notices were issued are non-existent. The writ petitions have been disposed of.

In another case, the court heard a writ petition challenging the closure notices issued to industrial units located within 10 km of the boundaries of a wildlife sanctuary. The petitioner argued that there was no Supreme Court order prohibiting mining activities within 10 km of the boundaries of national parks or wildlife sanctuaries. The court referred to a previous judgment and clarified that there was no such prohibition. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had issued a notification in 2017 prohibiting new industries and expansion of existing polluting industries in eco-sensitive zones, but not existing industries. The court considered the arguments of all parties and examined relevant materials before making its decision.

The court order also pertains to the notification of an eco-sensitive zone in the Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over an area of 109.99 square kilometers. The notification prohibits the establishment of new polluting industries within the eco-sensitive zone and lists activities to be prohibited or regulated. However, existing industries set up before the notification are not affected. The court has set aside closure notices issued to industrial units within the eco-sensitive zone, stating that the grounds on which the notices were issued are non-existent. The writ petitions have been disposed of.

The court's decision in these cases is significant as it highlights the need to balance economic growth with environmental protection. The court has clarified that existing industries are not affected by the notification of an eco-sensitive zone, but new industries cannot be established within the zone. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on the cement industry in Assam, as it will limit the establishment of new cement plants in the eco-sensitive zone.

Overall, the Gauhati High Court's decisions in these cases demonstrate the importance of environmental protection and the need to balance economic growth with environmental concerns. The court has taken a pragmatic approach, considering the arguments of all parties and examining relevant materials before making its decision. The court's decisions are likely to have a significant impact on the cement industry in Assam and will be closely watched by other industries operating in eco-sensitive zones.
