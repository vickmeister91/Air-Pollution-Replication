The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to petitions filed by individuals seeking permission to import animal trophies into India. In the first case, the petitioner, Samir Thapar, had legally acquired various species during a hunting trip in Tanzania and had applied for a no objection certificate to import one animal trophy for personal use. The court ordered that the final no objection certificate would only be given upon examination of the goods and relevant documents at the time of import.

In the second case, the petitioner had applied for a no objection certificate to import animal trophies, including the skull and skin of a Panthera pardus, which was denied by the Deputy Director Wildlife Regional Officer. The petitioner's counsel argued that there was no provision banning the import of Panthera pardus and that the decision was arbitrary and discriminatory. The counsel cited a similar case in Bombay High Court where the petitioner was granted permission to import Panthera pardus.

The third court order pertained to a petition filed by a person seeking permission to import a trophy of a leopard into India. The petitioner argued that the decision to deny a no objection certificate was contrary to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection Act) 1972 and rules framed thereunder. The petitioner contended that administrative instructions prohibiting the import of trophies of Panthera Pardus cannot be binding on him and are discriminatory, arbitrary, and bad in law. The court has heard arguments from both sides and is yet to make a decision.

The fourth court order stated that the import of panther (Panthera pardus) skin is illegal and prohibited under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Exim Policy. The petitioner had requested a "No Objection Certificate" for the import of hunting trophies from Tanzania, but the Ministry of Environment and Forests had rejected the request due to the lookalike factor. The import and export of any item into India is governed by the provisions of Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992.

The fifth court order discussed the import of tiger and cat skin, and the prohibition of importing wild animals and their parts under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Foreign Trade Policy. The petitioner had hunted a Panthera Pardus in Tanzania and sought a "No Objection Certificate" to import the trophy into India, but the request was rejected. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that there was no bar under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and that the import of the trophy fell under a different Exim Code. The court upheld the prohibition on importing wild animals and their parts.

In the final court order, the petitioner sought permission to import trophies and animal articles, but was denied due to the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The court found that there was no room for doubt that importing certain species, such as Panthera Pardus, was prohibited. The court also noted that granting import licenses to others for similar items, such as Mahatmas, was questionable and did not justify allowing the petitioner's request. The court ultimately dismissed the petition.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to individuals seeking permission to import animal trophies into India. While some petitioners argued that there was no provision banning the import of certain species, the courts upheld the prohibition on importing wild animals and their parts under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and other relevant policies and regulations. The courts also considered the legality and justification of granting import licenses to others for similar items. Ultimately, the courts dismissed most of the petitions and upheld the prohibition on importing wild animals and their parts.
