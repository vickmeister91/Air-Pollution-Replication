The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner is accused of committing offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The petitioner had filed an application challenging two orders passed by the judge, rejecting his applications to call for a report and a document from the police station and to discharge him from the alleged offences. The court found that the judge did not provide sufficient reasons for rejecting the application and quashed the order. 

The court also considered the petitioner's application to call for a report and a document from the police station and found that the judge's rejection of the application was not justified. The court relied on a Supreme Court judgment to hold that the court has the power to call for material not made part of the charge-sheet if it has a crucial bearing on the issue of framing of charge. This is a significant ruling as it upholds the rule of law and ensures that the court has the power to summon or rely upon material of sterling quality even if it is not part of the charge sheet.

The court order also rejects the defense's invocation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and remands the matter to the lower court for re-consideration of the question of discharge. The order emphasizes the need for expediting cases under the POCSO Act and directs all High Courts to ensure that such cases are tried and disposed of by Special Courts. This is a crucial directive as it ensures that cases under the POCSO Act are given priority and are dealt with expeditiously.

The court's decision to quash the judge's order rejecting the petitioner's application to call for a report and a document from the police station is significant as it ensures that the petitioner's right to a fair trial is protected. The court's reliance on a Supreme Court judgment to hold that the court has the power to call for material not made part of the charge-sheet if it has a crucial bearing on the issue of framing of charge is also significant as it ensures that the court has the power to summon or rely upon material of sterling quality even if it is not part of the charge sheet.

The court's rejection of the defense's invocation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is also significant as it ensures that the defense cannot use this provision to delay the proceedings or to avoid providing material that is crucial to the case. The court's directive to all High Courts to ensure that cases under the POCSO Act are tried and disposed of by Special Courts is also significant as it ensures that these cases are given priority and are dealt with expeditiously.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is significant as it upholds the rule of law and ensures that the petitioner's right to a fair trial is protected. The court's reliance on a Supreme Court judgment to hold that the court has the power to call for material not made part of the charge-sheet if it has a crucial bearing on the issue of framing of charge is also significant as it ensures that the court has the power to summon or rely upon material of sterling quality even if it is not part of the charge sheet. The court's rejection of the defense's invocation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and its directive to all High Courts to ensure that cases under the POCSO Act are tried and disposed of by Special Courts are also significant as they ensure that these cases are given priority and are dealt with expeditiously.
