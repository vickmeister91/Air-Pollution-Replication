The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in a revision petition filed by M/S Aarti Poultry Feed Pvt. Ltd against M/S Prince Layer Cum Hatchery Farm and others. The revisionist had sought to set aside an order passed by the Ld. MM in a criminal complaint, which had refused to direct the police to register an FIR against the respondents. The revisionist had claimed that five vouchers had been forged and fabricated, and the signatures of the director of the petitioner company had been forged by the respondents in connivance with each other.

The court carefully examined the facts and circumstances of the case and found no illegality in the impugned order of the Ld. MM. The court observed that the Ld. MM had considered all the relevant aspects of the case and had come to a reasoned conclusion that no case for registration of FIR was made out. The court noted that the Ld. MM had taken into account the fact that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to substantiate its allegations of forgery and fabrication of vouchers and signatures.

The court also observed that the Ld. MM had rightly relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh, wherein it was held that registration of FIR is mandatory only when the information discloses a cognizable offence. The court noted that in the present case, the allegations made by the petitioner did not disclose any cognizable offence and therefore, the Ld. MM had rightly refused to direct the police to register an FIR.

The court further observed that the revisionist had failed to point out any error or illegality in the impugned order of the Ld. MM. The court noted that the revisionist had merely reiterated the same allegations that were made before the Ld. MM and had not brought any new material on record to substantiate its case. The court held that the revisionist had failed to make out a case for interference in the impugned order of the Ld. MM and accordingly, disposed of the revision petition.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court has reiterated the well-established legal principle that registration of FIR is mandatory only when the information discloses a cognizable offence. The court has also emphasized the importance of producing sufficient evidence to substantiate allegations of forgery and fabrication of documents. The judgment serves as a reminder to litigants that they must bring new material on record to substantiate their case and cannot merely rely on bald allegations to seek relief from the court.
