The Calcutta High Court recently issued an order directing the respondents to take appropriate steps to stop the operation of a brick field run by private respondents. The court also ordered the respondents to give effect to the order of the Pollution Control Board. The court stated that no brick field on agricultural land can be regularized if it has come into operation after 01.09.2000 without the consent of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

The court further directed the operation of the brick field to be stopped until consent to operate is obtained and permission is taken to convert the agricultural land in accordance with the government notification. The writ petition was disposed of with the above direction.

The order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by the petitioner, who had alleged that the brick field was operating without the necessary permissions and was causing pollution in the area. The petitioner had also alleged that the brick field was operating on agricultural land, which was not permissible under the law.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the brick field was indeed operating without the necessary permissions and was causing pollution in the area. The court also noted that the brick field was operating on agricultural land, which was not permissible under the law.

The court, therefore, directed the respondents to take appropriate steps to stop the operation of the brick field until the necessary permissions were obtained. The court also directed the respondents to give effect to the order of the Pollution Control Board, which had earlier directed the closure of the brick field.

The court further observed that no brick field on agricultural land can be regularized if it has come into operation after 01.09.2000 without the consent of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. The court, therefore, directed the respondents to obtain the necessary consent to operate and permission to convert the agricultural land in accordance with the government notification.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of obtaining necessary permissions before starting any industrial activity. The order also highlights the need to protect agricultural land from industrial activities, which can have a detrimental impact on the environment and the livelihoods of farmers.

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's order directing the respondents to stop the operation of the brick field until the necessary permissions were obtained is a welcome step towards protecting the environment and ensuring compliance with the law. The order also serves as a reminder to all industries to obtain the necessary permissions before starting any activity and to respect the rights of farmers and the environment.
