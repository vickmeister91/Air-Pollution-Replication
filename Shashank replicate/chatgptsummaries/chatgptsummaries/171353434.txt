The applicant opposed the application, stating that it was filed only to create delay. The court found no illegality or perversity in the impugned order and dismissed the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a cost of Rs. 1,000/- to be paid by the applicant to the respondent before the trial court.
