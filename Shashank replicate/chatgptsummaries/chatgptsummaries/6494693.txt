The case of Dayananda Hegde versus the State of Karnataka involved a criminal petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed on an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.PC. However, the court dismissed the petition as withdrawn as the petitioner's counsel filed a memo seeking to withdraw the petition as not pressed.

Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Similarly, Section 91 of Cr.PC empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In the present case, the petitioner had filed a criminal petition seeking to set aside an order passed on an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.PC. It is not clear from the available information what the nature of the application was or what documents or things were sought to be produced. However, the court dismissed the petition as withdrawn as the petitioner's counsel filed a memo seeking to withdraw the petition as not pressed.

The term "not pressed" means that the petitioner's counsel did not wish to pursue the petition any further. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of evidence, change in circumstances, or settlement between the parties. When a petition is withdrawn as not pressed, it is deemed to have been dismissed without prejudice, which means that the petitioner can file a fresh petition on the same grounds if he so wishes.

The dismissal of the petition as withdrawn has the effect of upholding the order passed on the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.PC. It is not clear whether the petitioner had any other remedy available to challenge the order. However, the dismissal of the petition as withdrawn indicates that the petitioner did not have a strong case or was not able to present his case effectively before the court.

In conclusion, the case of Dayananda Hegde versus the State of Karnataka involved a criminal petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, seeking to set aside an order passed on an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.PC. However, the petition was dismissed as withdrawn as the petitioner's counsel filed a memo seeking to withdraw the petition as not pressed. The reasons for the withdrawal of the petition are not clear from the available information. However, the dismissal of the petition as withdrawn has the effect of upholding the order passed on the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.PC.
