In a recent court order, a criminal revision petition filed by Sumeet Kapani was considered. The petition was filed against an order that held a prima facie case for the offense under Section 15 of The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner argued that the trial court was not competent to take cognizance of the offense as no complaint was filed by the Central Government or any authorized officer. 

The court considered the arguments presented by the petitioner and agreed with them. The court set aside the order of framing charges against the accused persons and discharged them from the case. The co-accused Sumit Kaplani was also entitled to the same benefit due to the common case of prosecution against them.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect and improve the environment. The act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution. It also provides for the conservation of natural resources and the protection of biodiversity.

Section 15 of the act deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the act. The section states that whoever contravenes any provision of the act or any rule or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both. 

In the present case, the court had to consider whether the trial court was competent to take cognizance of the offense under Section 15 of the act. The petitioner argued that the trial court was not competent to take cognizance of the offense as no complaint was filed by the Central Government or any authorized officer.

The court considered the provisions of the act and the arguments presented by the petitioner. The court noted that Section 19 of the act provides for the cognizance of offenses. The section states that no court shall take cognizance of any offense under the act except on a complaint made by the Central Government or any authorized officer.

The court also noted that the provisions of the act are clear and unambiguous. The court observed that the trial court had erred in taking cognizance of the offense without a complaint being filed by the Central Government or any authorized officer. The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and set aside the order of framing charges against the accused persons, discharging them from the case.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the procedure for taking cognizance of offenses under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has made it clear that no court can take cognizance of any offense under the act except on a complaint made by the Central Government or any authorized officer. This decision will help in ensuring that the provisions of the act are followed in letter and spirit.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the present case is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. The court has clarified the procedure for taking cognizance of offenses under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The decision will help in ensuring that the provisions of the act are followed and that the environment is protected and conserved.
