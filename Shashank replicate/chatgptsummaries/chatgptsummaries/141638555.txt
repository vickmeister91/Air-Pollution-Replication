The court order pertains to an application for eviction of a tenant under Section 14(1)(a), (b) & (j) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The petitioner, who is the landlord, sought recovery of possession of a shop from the respondents, who are the tenants, for non-payment of rent, subletting the shop without obtaining the landlord's consent, and causing substantial damage to the premises.
