The court order in question pertains to two writ petitions, both of which were filed against the Union of India and others. The first writ petition was filed by Mohd. Kausar Jah, who complained of a violation of Notification No. S.O. 1533, dated 14.09.2006, issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, in exercise of powers under sub-section 1 and clause (v) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The second writ petition was filed by Shyam Bahadur Sakhya.

The court disposed of both petitions by a common judgment, as the relief and challenges were inter-connected. The court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the facts and legal arguments presented by both parties.

The court found that the Notification No. S.O. 1533, dated 14.09.2006, was issued to regulate the use of hazardous waste in the manufacture of cement. The notification required cement plants to use only hazardous waste that had been pre-processed and pre-treated to meet certain standards. The purpose of the notification was to ensure that the use of hazardous waste in cement plants did not pose a threat to the environment or public health.

The court noted that the petitioners had alleged that certain cement plants were violating the notification by using hazardous waste that had not been pre-processed or pre-treated to meet the required standards. The petitioners had also alleged that the Union of India and other authorities had failed to take action against these cement plants.

The court found that the allegations made by the petitioners were supported by evidence. The court noted that inspections conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had revealed that some cement plants were indeed using hazardous waste that did not meet the required standards. The court also noted that the CPCB had issued show cause notices to these cement plants, but no action had been taken against them.

The court held that the use of hazardous waste in cement plants without pre-processing or pre-treatment was a violation of the Notification No. S.O. 1533, dated 14.09.2006. The court directed the Union of India and other authorities to take immediate action against the cement plants that were violating the notification. The court also directed the authorities to ensure that all cement plants in the country were complying with the notification.

The court's decision was a significant victory for environmental protection in India. The court's ruling ensured that hazardous waste would be used in cement plants only after it had been pre-processed and pre-treated to meet certain standards. This would help to prevent environmental pollution and protect public health.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertained to two writ petitions filed against the Union of India and others. The court found that certain cement plants were violating Notification No. S.O. 1533, dated 14.09.2006, which regulated the use of hazardous waste in the manufacture of cement. The court directed the authorities to take immediate action against the cement plants that were violating the notification and to ensure that all cement plants in the country were complying with the notification. The court's decision was a significant victory for environmental protection in India.
