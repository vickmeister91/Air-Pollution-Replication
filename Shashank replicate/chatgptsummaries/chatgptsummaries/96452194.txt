The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately allowed the petition, directing the concerned authority to release the vehicle on certain conditions. These conditions included the filing of a bond and an undertaking to produce the vehicle as and when directed by the trial court. The court also referred to previous cases and directives regarding the handling of seized vehicles and the need for prompt action by the authorities.
