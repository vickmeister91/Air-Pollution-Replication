The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently dismissed a writ petition and allowed the petitioners to file an appeal against the impugned orders before the prescribed Appellate Authority. The court directed that if the appeals are filed within two weeks from the date of the order, they shall be treated as filed within the prescribed period and heard on merits. The court also directed that for a further period of two weeks, disconnection of electric power shall remain stayed subject to certain conditions. The petitioners were allowed to move the Appellate Authority for interim orders.

The case in question involved a writ petition filed by the petitioners, who were aggrieved by certain orders passed by the authorities regarding the disconnection of electric power supply to their premises. The petitioners had challenged the orders on various grounds, including the lack of jurisdiction of the authorities to pass such orders, the violation of principles of natural justice, and the non-compliance with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioners to file an appeal before the prescribed Appellate Authority. The court held that the petitioners had an alternative remedy available to them under the law, and that they should have approached the Appellate Authority instead of filing a writ petition directly before the High Court.

The court also directed that if the appeals are filed within two weeks from the date of the order, they shall be treated as filed within the prescribed period and heard on merits. This was a significant relief for the petitioners, as it meant that they would not be barred from filing an appeal due to the delay caused by the filing of the writ petition before the High Court.

Furthermore, the court directed that for a further period of two weeks, disconnection of electric power shall remain stayed subject to certain conditions. This was another significant relief for the petitioners, as it meant that they would not be deprived of electric power supply during the pendency of their appeal before the Appellate Authority.

The court also allowed the petitioners to move the Appellate Authority for interim orders. This meant that the petitioners could approach the Appellate Authority for temporary relief, such as the restoration of electric power supply, while their appeal was pending before the Appellate Authority.

In conclusion, the Punjab-Haryana High Court dismissed a writ petition and allowed the petitioners to file an appeal before the prescribed Appellate Authority. The court directed that if the appeals are filed within two weeks from the date of the order, they shall be treated as filed within the prescribed period and heard on merits. The court also directed that for a further period of two weeks, disconnection of electric power shall remain stayed subject to certain conditions. The petitioners were allowed to move the Appellate Authority for interim orders. This was a significant relief for the petitioners, as it meant that they would have an opportunity to challenge the impugned orders before the Appellate Authority and seek temporary relief during the pendency of their appeal.
