The Bombay High Court recently ruled that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) exceeded its jurisdiction in a case where a petitioner invoked the tribunal's jurisdiction to ensure that the river Mula Mutha in Pune is made free from the discharge of untreated effluent. The court quashed the notice issued by the NGT to the petitioner but directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to pass a final order pursuant to the show cause notice which was issued to the petitioner by the board on March 10, 2017. The court also stated that the procedures of the law contemplated post notice issued till final order passed shall be followed.

The case in question pertains to a petition filed by a Pune-based environmental activist, who had approached the NGT seeking directions to the MPCB to ensure that the river Mula Mutha is made free from the discharge of untreated effluent. The petitioner had alleged that the MPCB had failed to take any action against the polluting industries in the area, which were discharging untreated effluent into the river, thereby causing severe pollution and posing a threat to the health of the people living in the vicinity.

The NGT had issued a notice to the petitioner, directing him to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The petitioner had responded to the notice, stating that the NGT had jurisdiction to hear the matter, as the pollution caused by the industries was affecting the environment and the health of the people living in the area.

The NGT had then issued a notice to the MPCB, directing it to file a reply to the petition. The MPCB had filed a reply, stating that it had already taken action against the polluting industries in the area and that the river was now free from the discharge of untreated effluent.

The NGT had then directed the MPCB to file an affidavit, stating the steps taken by it to ensure that the river is made free from the discharge of untreated effluent. The MPCB had filed an affidavit, stating that it had taken various steps, including the closure of polluting industries, to ensure that the river is made free from the discharge of untreated effluent.

The NGT had then directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder to the affidavit filed by the MPCB. The petitioner had filed a rejoinder, stating that the steps taken by the MPCB were not sufficient to ensure that the river is made free from the discharge of untreated effluent.

The NGT had then heard the matter and had reserved its order. However, before the NGT could pass its order, the petitioner had approached the Bombay High Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the NGT to hear the matter.

The Bombay High Court, after hearing the parties, held that the NGT had exceeded its jurisdiction in the matter. The court observed that the NGT had no jurisdiction to hear the matter, as the pollution caused by the industries was not affecting any water body falling within the jurisdiction of the NGT. The court also observed that the NGT had no jurisdiction to hear the matter, as the pollution caused by the industries was not affecting the environment in any manner.

The court, therefore, quashed the notice issued by the NGT to the petitioner. However, the court directed the MPCB to pass a final order pursuant to the show cause notice which was issued to the petitioner by the board on March 10, 2017. The court also directed that the procedures of the law contemplated post notice issued till final order passed shall be followed.

The court's ruling is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of the NGT in matters relating to pollution caused by industries. The ruling also highlights the importance of following the procedures of the law in matters relating to pollution control. The ruling is likely to have a significant impact on the way pollution control measures are implemented in the country.
