The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by Akhil Augusty and an unnamed petitioner challenging the consent to operate issued to various respondents by the Environmental Engineer, District Office, Kerala State Pollution Control Board, Kalpetta, Wayanad under section 25 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. 

In the first case, Akhil Augusty's writ petition was filed against the State of Kerala and various other respondents. The petitioner challenged the consent to operate issued to the 9th respondent and the court delivered a judgment on February 3, 2014. The court noted the exhibits submitted by both the petitioner and the respondents. 

In the second case, the unnamed petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner sought a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the Senior Environmental Engineer to consider his representation and pass appropriate orders. The court noted that there were appellate remedies available to the petitioner and declined jurisdiction, dismissing the writ petition without prejudice to the petitioner's right to invoke the appellate remedies available to him. 

Both cases dealt with the issue of consent to operate under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. These Acts were enacted to prevent and control water and air pollution, respectively. The Acts provide for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels to implement the provisions of the Acts. 

Section 25 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 provides for the requirement of consent to establish and operate any industry, operation or process that is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well or on land. Similarly, section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 provides for the requirement of consent to establish and operate any industry, operation or process that is likely to emit any air pollutant into the atmosphere. 

The consent to operate is granted by the pollution control board after verifying that the industry, operation or process complies with the prescribed standards and guidelines. The consent to operate is valid for a specified period and is subject to renewal. The pollution control board has the power to revoke or suspend the consent to operate if the industry, operation or process violates any of the prescribed standards or guidelines. 

In the first case, Akhil Augusty challenged the consent to operate issued to the 9th respondent by the Environmental Engineer, District Office, Kerala State Pollution Control Board, Kalpetta, Wayanad. The petitioner alleged that the 9th respondent was operating a quarry without obtaining the necessary clearances and was causing air and water pollution. The petitioner also alleged that the 9th respondent was operating the quarry in violation of the conditions of the consent to operate. 

The court noted that the petitioner had submitted various exhibits to support his case, including photographs of the quarry and the surrounding area. The court also noted that the respondents had submitted their own exhibits, including reports of inspections conducted by the pollution control board. 

After considering the exhibits and hearing the arguments of both parties, the court held that the petitioner had failed to establish that the 9th respondent was operating the quarry in violation of the conditions of the consent to operate. The court noted that the pollution control board had conducted inspections and had not found any violations. The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the pollution control board had acted arbitrarily or illegally in granting the consent to operate. 

In the second case, the unnamed petitioner challenged section 28 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner sought a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the Senior Environmental Engineer to consider his representation and pass appropriate orders. 

The court noted that there were appellate remedies available to the petitioner and declined jurisdiction. The court held that the petitioner could avail of the appellate remedies available to him and that the writ petition was premature. The court dismissed the writ petition without prejudice to the petitioner's right to invoke the appellate remedies available to him. 

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate writ petitions challenging the consent to operate issued by the pollution control board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the petitioner in the first case had failed to establish that the respondent was operating the quarry in violation of the conditions of the consent to operate. The court dismissed the writ petition in the second case without prejudice to the petitioner's right to invoke the appellate remedies available to him. The court's decision reinforces the importance of complying with the prescribed standards and guidelines under the Acts to prevent and control water and air pollution.
