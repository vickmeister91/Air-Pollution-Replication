Two court orders were recently issued in India, both involving the alleged possession of leopard skins by the accused. In the first case, Laxman Singh was acquitted of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, due to lack of evidence. Singh was accused of carrying three leopard cat uncured skins without a permit or license. The prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and there were material contradictions in the statements of the witnesses. The police officials who testified did not provide any DD entry in court to prove that they were patrolling in the area at the time of the incident.

In the second case, witnesses testified that the accused was apprehended with a bag containing the skins, but there were inconsistencies in the testimony and no effort was made to trace the source of the skins. The defense argued that the skins were not sent for testing and that the case property produced in court could not be linked to the recovery of the skins. The court ultimately found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In the first case, Laxman Singh was accused of violating the Act by carrying three leopard cat uncured skins without a permit or license. The prosecution argued that Singh was caught with the skins by forest officials during a routine patrol. However, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. There were material contradictions in the statements of the witnesses, and the police officials who testified did not provide any DD entry in court to prove that they were patrolling in the area at the time of the incident.

The court noted that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the skins were actually leopard cat skins. The prosecution had also failed to establish that Singh was in possession of the skins without a permit or license. The court found that the prosecution had not discharged its burden of proof and acquitted Singh of all charges.

In the second case, the accused was apprehended with a bag containing leopard skins. Witnesses testified that they had seen the accused with the bag, and the bag was produced in court as case property. However, the defense argued that the skins were not sent for testing and that the case property produced in court could not be linked to the recovery of the skins.

The court noted that there were inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses. The prosecution had also failed to make any effort to trace the source of the skins. The court found that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused of all charges.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution and that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court also emphasized the need for proper investigation and collection of evidence in cases involving wildlife crimes.

In conclusion, the court acquitted Laxman Singh and the accused in the two cases of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, due to lack of evidence. The court emphasized the importance of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt and the need for proper investigation and collection of evidence in cases involving wildlife crimes. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an important law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. It is important that the law is enforced properly to ensure the conservation of wildlife in India.
