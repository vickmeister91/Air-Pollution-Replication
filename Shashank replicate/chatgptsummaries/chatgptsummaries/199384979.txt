The court orders discussed in this article all pertain to disputes between landlords and tenants over eviction orders. In the first case, the landlady sought eviction of the tenants on the grounds of personal bona fide need for her son's business expansion. The tenants denied non-payment of rent and material impairment of the premises. The Rent Controller allowed the eviction petition on the grounds of bona fide personal need of the landlady. The tenants challenged this decision in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana.

The court found that the landlady had a genuine need for the property for her son's business expansion and upheld the eviction order. The tenants' arguments regarding non-payment of rent and material impairment of the premises were not considered relevant to the case. The court's decision was based solely on the landlady's bona fide personal need for the property.

In the second case, the petitioner sought to convert a property into a showroom for non-ferrous metal products. The petitioner's son was already running a business in the same building and wanted to expand. The court found that the property was suitable for the son's business and that the petitioner had a genuine need for it. The respondent's arguments that the petitioner should use another property or that the petitioner had not disclosed other businesses were dismissed by the court. The appellate authority also upheld the decision.

In the third case, the landlord sought eviction of a tenant on the grounds of personal necessity for her son's business expansion. The tenant challenged the eviction order on the basis that the landlord did not appear in court to depose and that her attorney holder (her son) was not competent to depose on her behalf. The court held that an attorney holder can only give formal evidence about the validity of the power of attorney and the filing of the suit, but cannot depose in place of the principal for acts or transactions of which the principal alone has personal knowledge. However, if the attorney holder has personal knowledge of such acts or transactions, he may be examined as a witness to prove those acts or transactions. The court also held that a landlord can seek eviction of a tenant not only for his or her own need but even for the need of a closely related person. The court ultimately upheld the eviction order in this case.

In the fourth case, the court found that normally, only the person concerned can give evidence and not their attorney holder. However, there is an exception where the affairs of a party are completely managed by an attorney who happens to be a close family member. In this case, the evidence of such an attorney can be accepted. The court found that the attorney holder in this case, who was the son of the landlady seeking eviction of the tenant, was in a position to substantiate the plea of personal necessity and had provided evidence that met the requirements of Section 13 of the Act. Therefore, the court upheld the eviction order.

In all of these cases, the courts considered the personal bona fide need of the landlord or their closely related person as the primary factor in deciding whether to grant an eviction order. The tenants' arguments regarding non-payment of rent or material impairment of the premises were not considered relevant to the cases. The courts also clarified the role of attorney holders in giving evidence and the circumstances under which their evidence can be accepted.
