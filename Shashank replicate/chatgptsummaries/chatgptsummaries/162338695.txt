The court has recently issued orders in three separate cases related to land allotment and rehabilitation of land-losers in Karnataka. In the first case, a writ petition was filed by several individuals against the State of Karnataka and various government officials. The petitioners claimed that they were displaced by the Hemavathi Reservoir Project and were promised alternative lands for rehabilitation. However, the lands allotted to them were later found to be a part of a forest area, and the government decided to cancel the allotment and grant alternative lands elsewhere. The petitioners challenged this decision and sought to quash the impugned letter and order. The court heard the case and reserved its order.

In the second case, the original grant of land in Bellibattada Kaval village was cancelled, and alternative lands were granted in Margonahalli village. The petitioners are seeking the allotment of lands in Bellibattada Kaval village as has been done for other displaced persons. The court notes that the State Government has not taken any concrete action to rehabilitate the petitioners, who have lost their lands for the purpose of an irrigation project. The court directs the State Government to find alternative land that is free from litigation and to grant possession of the same to the petitioners within three months. The court also notes that the State Government must obtain F.C. clearance from the Central Government before handing over possession of Sy.No.1 of Bellibettada Kaval Village to the petitioners.

In the third case, the petitioners are seeking possession of land that was granted to them in 1972 but has not been allotted to them due to delays caused by the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court directs the respondent authorities to seek FC clearance for the land within three months and submit a proposal to the Central Government for its consideration and approval. The court also notes that the State Government cannot pick and choose from among its citizens for the purpose of conferring benefits under a scheme which it has formulated for the rehabilitation of land-losers. The writ petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

In all three cases, the court has directed the State Government to take concrete action to rehabilitate the land-losers and to ensure that they are granted alternative lands that are free from litigation. The court has also emphasized the need for the State Government to obtain necessary clearances from the Central Government before handing over possession of any land to the petitioners. The court has further noted that the State Government cannot discriminate among its citizens for the purpose of conferring benefits under a scheme formulated for the rehabilitation of land-losers.

The court's orders in these cases are significant as they highlight the need for the State Government to take proactive steps to rehabilitate land-losers and to ensure that they are granted alternative lands that are free from litigation. The court's emphasis on obtaining necessary clearances from the Central Government before handing over possession of any land to the petitioners is also important as it ensures that the State Government complies with all legal requirements before taking any action. The court's observation that the State Government cannot discriminate among its citizens for the purpose of conferring benefits under a scheme formulated for the rehabilitation of land-losers is also significant as it ensures that all land-losers are treated equally and are granted the same benefits under the scheme. 

Overall, the court's orders in these cases are a step in the right direction towards ensuring that land-losers are rehabilitated and granted alternative lands that are free from litigation. The State Government must take note of these orders and take proactive steps to comply with them in order to ensure that justice is done to all land-losers.
