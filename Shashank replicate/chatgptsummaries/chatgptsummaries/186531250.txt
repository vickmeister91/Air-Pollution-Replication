The State of Karnataka filed a criminal appeal and revision petition against Sathisha and two others, charging them with various offenses including possession of a tiger hide, possession of a firearm, and theft. After examining the evidence presented by the prosecution, the court found that the accused were guilty of theft and possession of the tiger hide, but not of possession of the firearm. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the State and partially accepted the revision petition filed by the accused.

The court order also fixed the remuneration for the standing counsel in Criminal Appeal No. 194/2009 at Rs. 5,000. The order was signed by Judge SNN.

The case involved multiple charges against the accused, including possession of a tiger hide, possession of a firearm, and theft. The prosecution presented evidence to support these charges, but the court found that the evidence was only sufficient to convict the accused of theft and possession of the tiger hide. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the State, indicating that the evidence presented was not strong enough to support the charges of possession of a firearm.

The court partially accepted the revision petition filed by the accused, indicating that there were some issues with the original verdict that needed to be addressed. The court did not provide details on what these issues were, but it is likely that they related to the charges that were dismissed.

In addition to the verdict, the court also fixed the remuneration for the standing counsel in Criminal Appeal No. 194/2009 at Rs. 5,000. This is a standard practice in legal proceedings, as it ensures that the counsel is compensated for their time and effort.

Overall, the court order represents a mixed verdict for the accused and the State of Karnataka. While the accused were found guilty of some charges, they were acquitted of others. The State's appeal was dismissed, indicating that the evidence presented was not strong enough to support all of the charges. The court also fixed the remuneration for the standing counsel, ensuring that they are compensated for their work on the case.
