The court order in question pertains to an application made under Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code. This rule allows for additional evidence to be produced in an appeal under certain circumstances. The court cites a previous case where the jurisdiction for taking fresh evidence was questioned and ultimately found to be limited. The court concludes that an application for further evidence to be taken on the grounds of recently discovered evidence does not fall under the provisions of Order XLI, Rule 27.

The court then proceeds to discuss the merits of the appeal, which was ultimately allowed. The case in question involved a dispute between two parties over the ownership of a piece of land. The lower court had ruled in favor of the defendant, but the plaintiff had appealed the decision.

The plaintiff had sought to introduce new evidence in the form of a survey report that had not been available at the time of the lower court proceedings. The plaintiff argued that this report was crucial to their case and that they had only recently become aware of its existence.

The court, however, found that the plaintiff had not met the requirements for introducing new evidence under Order XLI, Rule 27. The court noted that the rule only allows for additional evidence to be produced if it is necessary for the determination of the appeal and could not have been produced earlier with reasonable diligence.

The court found that the plaintiff had not shown that the survey report was necessary for the determination of the appeal. The court also noted that the plaintiff had not shown that they had exercised reasonable diligence in obtaining the report earlier.

Having found that the plaintiff had not met the requirements for introducing new evidence, the court proceeded to consider the merits of the appeal based on the evidence that had been presented at the lower court proceedings.

The court found that the lower court had erred in its interpretation of the evidence and that the plaintiff was in fact the rightful owner of the land in question. The court therefore allowed the appeal and ordered that the plaintiff be granted possession of the land.

In conclusion, the court order discussed an application made under Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code, which allows for additional evidence to be produced in an appeal under certain circumstances. The court found that an application for further evidence to be taken on the grounds of recently discovered evidence does not fall under the provisions of Order XLI, Rule 27. The court then proceeded to consider the merits of the appeal and ultimately allowed it, finding that the plaintiff was the rightful owner of the land in question.
