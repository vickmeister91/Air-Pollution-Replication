The case of Harbir Singh, who filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, requesting the release of a tractor with a trolley on superdari in F.I.R. No. 50/2016 registered at Police Station Badi, District Dholpur, for the offenses under Sections 379, 307 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 & Section 29/51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 & Sections 41 & 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, was recently heard in court. The trial court had rejected the application for release of the vehicle, and the revision petition was dismissed by the Court of Revision. However, the petitioner's counsel argued that the vehicle was lying in police custody and would become scrap, and there was no statutory bar on the release of the vehicle on superdari during trial.

The court considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner's counsel and allowed the petition. The court ordered the release of the vehicle on superdari to the petitioner, subject to his furnishing necessary bonds to the satisfaction of the trial court. This decision was made in light of the fact that the vehicle was lying in police custody and would become scrap if not released. Additionally, there was no statutory bar on the release of the vehicle on superdari during trial.

The court's decision was based on the principle of justice and fairness. The court recognized that the petitioner had a legitimate interest in the vehicle and that the vehicle was not being used for any illegal activity. The court also recognized that the petitioner had a right to use the vehicle for his livelihood and that the continued detention of the vehicle would cause him undue hardship.

The court's decision was also based on the fact that the release of the vehicle on superdari would not prejudice the ongoing trial. The court recognized that the release of the vehicle would not affect the evidence or the witnesses in the case. The court also recognized that the release of the vehicle would not affect the outcome of the trial.

In conclusion, the court's decision to release the vehicle on superdari to the petitioner was based on the principles of justice and fairness. The court recognized that the petitioner had a legitimate interest in the vehicle and that the continued detention of the vehicle would cause him undue hardship. The court also recognized that the release of the vehicle on superdari would not prejudice the ongoing trial. The court's decision was a just and fair one, and it upheld the principles of justice and fairness that are fundamental to our legal system.
