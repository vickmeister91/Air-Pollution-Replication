The court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner was convicted under Section 51 (1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year. The petitioner challenged the judgments of the Courts below and sought a reduction in the quantum of sentence to the period already undergone. The court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by the petitioner, while maintaining the conviction. The petitioner had already undergone a sentence of 3 months and 19 days.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. Section 51 (1) of the Act deals with the punishment for offences under the Act and provides for a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000.

In the present case, the petitioner was convicted under Section 51 (1) of the Act for hunting a wild boar in a protected area without a permit. The petitioner had argued that he had not intentionally hunted the wild boar and that he had only stumbled upon it while he was out on a walk. However, the trial court had rejected this argument and convicted the petitioner.

The petitioner had then appealed to the higher courts, but his appeals were dismissed. The petitioner had then filed a revision petition before the High Court, which had also been dismissed. The petitioner had then approached the Supreme Court, which had granted him leave to appeal.

The Supreme Court had heard the petitioner's arguments and had noted that the petitioner had already undergone a sentence of 3 months and 19 days. The Court had also noted that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and that he had been convicted for a non-violent offence. The Court had therefore decided to reduce the sentence to the period already undergone by the petitioner.

The Court had also maintained the conviction of the petitioner, as it had found that the evidence on record clearly established that the petitioner had hunted the wild boar without a permit. The Court had observed that the protection of wildlife was an important public interest and that the Act had been enacted to ensure that wildlife was not exploited or harmed.

The Court had therefore upheld the conviction of the petitioner, but had reduced the sentence to the period already undergone. The Court had also directed the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000, which was the minimum fine prescribed under the Act for the offence committed by the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner was convicted under Section 51 (1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for hunting a wild boar in a protected area without a permit. The petitioner had challenged the judgments of the Courts below and sought a reduction in the quantum of sentence to the period already undergone. The court had reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by the petitioner, while maintaining the conviction. The petitioner had already undergone a sentence of 3 months and 19 days. The Court had also directed the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000. The Court had upheld the conviction of the petitioner, but had reduced the sentence in view of the petitioner's lack of criminal record and the non-violent nature of the offence committed by him. The Court had also observed that the protection of wildlife was an important public interest and that the Act had been enacted to ensure that wildlife was not exploited or harmed.
