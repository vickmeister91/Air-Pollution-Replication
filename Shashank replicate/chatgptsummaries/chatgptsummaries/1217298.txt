The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that while it has the power to review and reconsider evidence, it should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the conclusion is perverse. The court found that the appellant had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and upheld the acquittal.

The court order states that the appellant has not provided enough evidence to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The advocate for the appellant cannot provide any evidence to contradict the trial court's decision. The court finds that the trial court's decision to acquit the respondents is justified and proper, and there is no reason to interfere with it. The appeal is dismissed, and the record and proceedings are sent back to the trial court.
