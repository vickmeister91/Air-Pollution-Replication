The court order pertains to a land acquisition case in which the government of NCT of Delhi acquired land for the construction of a grade/flyover at Najafgarh Road & Patel Road Intersection near Moti Nagar, New Delhi. The petitioner, M/s Structural Fabricators Pvt. Ltd., filed a reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act against the compensation assessed by the Collector, claiming it to be too low. The petitioner argued that the land had potential value as an industrial and commercial site and that the compensation granted by the Collector was based on rates fixed in 1999 and not revised since March 2000. The petitioner prayed for enhanced compensation along with statutory solatium and interest. The Union of India filed a written statement denying the petitioner's claim and stating that the Collector had already assessed the correct market value of the land.

The court considered the evidence presented by both parties and found that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. However, the court determined that the fair market value of the land was Rs. 31,733.59 per sq. meter. The petitioner was awarded compensation at this rate, along with additional amounts for solatium, interest, and appreciation. The court ordered the Land Acquisition Collector to deposit the balance amount immediately.
