The accused, Hitesh Karamshibhai Makwana and another person, were arrested for allegedly possessing and transporting alcohol without a license.

These conditions are standard for bail applications and are intended to ensure that the accused appear for trial and do not flee the jurisdiction.

The court also directed the trial court not to be influenced by the observations made by the court while granting bail.

The court granted the bail application and imposed standard conditions to ensure that the accused appear for trial and do not flee the jurisdiction.
