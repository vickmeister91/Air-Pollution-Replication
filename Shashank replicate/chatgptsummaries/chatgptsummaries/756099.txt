Thangaraj, who complained that granite waste was being dumped into irrigation tanks in the Periyar Vaigai River Basin, causing environmental hazards and hardship to the irrigation facilities and inland fishing rights of villagers. The court considered the principles of Sustainable Development, which require the onus of proof to be on the developer to show that their actions are environmentally benign.
