The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has been at the center of a legal dispute regarding the removal of its Chairman. The case was brought before the court on appeal, with the appellant seeking to challenge the decision to remove the Chairman from his position. However, the court has now issued an order stating that the appeal has lost its significance, as the Chairman's tenure is set to expire soon and will not be extended. As a result, the appeal has been rendered infructuous and has been disposed of accordingly.

The Haryana State Pollution Control Board is a regulatory body responsible for monitoring and controlling pollution in the state of Haryana. The Chairman of the Board is a key figure in the organization, responsible for overseeing its operations and ensuring that it fulfills its mandate. However, the Chairman's tenure has been the subject of controversy in recent months, with his removal from the position sparking a legal battle.

The appeal against the Chairman's removal was brought before the court by an aggrieved party seeking to challenge the decision. The appellant argued that the Chairman's removal was unjustified and that he should be reinstated to his position. However, the court has now ruled that the appeal has lost its significance, as the Chairman's tenure is set to expire soon and will not be extended.

The court's decision to render the appeal infructuous is based on the fact that the Chairman's tenure is expiring soon. The court has noted that the issues raised in the appeal will become moot once the Chairman's tenure comes to an end, as he will no longer be in a position to influence the operations of the Board. As a result, the court has decided to dispose of the appeal as such, effectively ending the legal battle over the Chairman's removal.

The court's decision is likely to have significant implications for the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. With the Chairman's tenure set to expire soon, the Board will need to find a new leader to take over the reins. This will be a critical time for the organization, as it seeks to maintain its mandate of monitoring and controlling pollution in the state of Haryana.

Overall, the court's order regarding the appeal against the removal of the Chairman of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board is a significant development in the ongoing legal battle. The court's decision to render the appeal infructuous effectively ends the dispute, and the Board will now need to focus on finding a new leader to take over the reins. The decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that regulatory bodies are led by competent and effective leaders who can fulfill their mandate of protecting the environment and public health.
