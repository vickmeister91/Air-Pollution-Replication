The Rajasthan High Court has issued an order to the State Urban Development and other concerned authorities to complete the construction of a sewage line in the city of Ajmer by March 2020. The court has expressed its concern over the slow progress of the project, which was initiated over a decade ago. The court has also suggested that the Pollution Control Board should be involved in disconnecting water and electricity supply to residents who refuse to obtain sewerage connections.

The court's order comes in response to a petition filed by a local resident, who had raised concerns over the lack of proper sewage facilities in the city. The petitioner had argued that the absence of a proper sewage system was leading to the contamination of water bodies and posing a serious health hazard to the residents of the city.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the petitioner and the concerned authorities, has directed the State Urban Development and other authorities to complete the construction of the sewage line by March 2020. The court has also noted that the project has been progressing slowly and has expressed its dissatisfaction over the same.

The court has suggested that the Pollution Control Board should be involved in disconnecting water and electricity supply to residents who refuse to obtain sewerage connections. The court has argued that this would act as a deterrent for those who are reluctant to obtain sewerage connections and would ensure that the sewage system is used effectively.

The court has also directed the concerned authorities to take necessary steps to ensure that the sewage system is maintained properly and is not allowed to deteriorate. The court has emphasized that the proper maintenance of the sewage system is essential to ensure that the health of the residents of the city is not compromised.

The court has further directed the concerned authorities to submit a progress report on the construction of the sewage line by August 6, 2019. The court has stated that it would review the matter again on that date and would take appropriate action if necessary.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's order to complete the construction of the sewage line in Ajmer by March 2020 is a welcome step towards ensuring that the residents of the city have access to proper sewage facilities. The court's suggestion to involve the Pollution Control Board in disconnecting water and electricity supply to residents who refuse to obtain sewerage connections is also a positive step towards ensuring that the sewage system is used effectively. The court's emphasis on the proper maintenance of the sewage system is also essential to ensure that the health of the residents of the city is not compromised. The court's decision to review the matter again on August 6, 2019, is also a positive step towards ensuring that the concerned authorities are held accountable for the timely completion of the project.
