The Bombay High Court recently allowed Siddanath Stone Crusher to withdraw their petition with the liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal. The respondents argued that the petitioner had an alternate efficacious remedy under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petition was disposed of accordingly.

The case involved Siddanath Stone Crusher, who had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking relief from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The petitioner had claimed that the MPCB had issued a notice to them under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

The petitioner had also claimed that the MPCB had not followed the due process of law while issuing the notice. The petitioner had sought a direction from the court to quash the notice issued by the MPCB and to restrain them from taking any coercive action against the petitioner.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner had an alternate efficacious remedy under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. They contended that the petitioner could approach the National Green Tribunal for relief.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and observed that the petitioner had an alternate efficacious remedy under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the petitioner could approach the National Green Tribunal for relief.

In light of this, the court allowed the petitioner to withdraw their petition with the liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal. The court disposed of the petition accordingly.

The case highlights the importance of following due process of law while issuing notices under environmental laws. It also underscores the need for petitioners to exhaust all alternate remedies before approaching the courts for relief.
