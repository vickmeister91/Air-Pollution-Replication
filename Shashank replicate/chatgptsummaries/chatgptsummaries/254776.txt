The recent court order in the case between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. and the Commissioner of Income-Tax has shed light on the classification of certain items as "plant" or "furniture" for the purpose of extra shift allowance. The court was asked to determine whether bins, racks, and shelves fell under the category of "plant" or "furniture" and were therefore entitled to extra shift allowance.

In order to arrive at a decision, the court applied the functional test, which involves examining the purpose for which the item is used. The court found that the bins, racks, and shelves in question were used for storage and were therefore essential to the functioning of the factory. As such, they were classified as "plant" and entitled to extra shift allowance.

However, the court also had to consider the classification of radar equipment, which was also under dispute. The court determined that radar equipment was wireless equipment and did not fall under the category of "plant". As such, it was not entitled to extra shift allowance.

The court's decision was based on a previous ruling in favor of the Revenue regarding the provision for accrued leave salary. This ruling had established that the functional test was the appropriate method for determining whether an item was classified as "plant" or "furniture".

The court's decision in this case has important implications for companies that are seeking to claim extra shift allowance for certain items. It highlights the importance of understanding the functional test and ensuring that items are classified correctly in order to avoid disputes with the tax authorities.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides clarity on the classification of certain items as "plant" or "furniture" and underscores the importance of understanding the functional test in determining this classification. Companies should take note of this ruling and ensure that they are correctly classifying items in order to avoid potential disputes with the tax authorities.
