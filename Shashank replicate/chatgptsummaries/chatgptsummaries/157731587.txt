The court has issued two separate orders in response to Public Interest Litigation (PIL) cases filed against mining activities in Rajasthan. The first order pertains to mining activities near the Mahanal Temple, which the petitioners allege contravene the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, and pose a danger to the temple. The court had previously ordered the respondents to stop mining activities, and after hearing all parties, the court found that the Archaeological Survey of India had already issued a notice under the Act of 1958. The court ordered that no mining activities should be carried out in the area falling within 100 meters of the temple and 200 meters of the forest area.

The second court order relates to a licensee who had applied for a No Objection Certificate for mining activities. The State Pollution Control Board had granted consent to establish and operate, but issued notices for revocation of consent and prosecution. The licensee had replied to these notices and the proceedings were pending. The court believed that the concerned authorities should be allowed to make a decision in the pending matters after hearing all concerned parties. The court also ordered that the interim order passed on 13.10.2011 be made absolute and operative with the modification that the respondents shall not carry out any mining activities at the area it has been restrained from by the said notice dated 23.12.2010 until conclusion of the pending proceedings. The petitions stand disposed of with the observations and directions foregoing while leaving it open for all the parties to take recourse to the appropriate remedies in accordance with law.

In the first order, the court has taken a strong stance against mining activities near the Mahanal Temple. The court has found that the mining activities contravene the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, and pose a danger to the temple. The court has ordered that no mining activities should be carried out in the area falling within 100 meters of the temple and 200 meters of the forest area. This order is significant as it seeks to protect a historical monument and ensure that it is not damaged by mining activities.

In the second order, the court has taken a more cautious approach. The court has acknowledged that the concerned authorities should be allowed to make a decision in the pending matters after hearing all concerned parties. The court has also ordered that the interim order passed on 13.10.2011 be made absolute and operative with the modification that the respondents shall not carry out any mining activities at the area it has been restrained from by the said notice dated 23.12.2010 until conclusion of the pending proceedings. This order is significant as it seeks to ensure that the licensee does not carry out any mining activities until the pending proceedings are concluded.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of protecting historical monuments and ensuring that mining activities do not pose a danger to them. The court has taken a strong stance in the first order and a cautious approach in the second order, highlighting the need to balance the interests of all concerned parties. These orders are significant as they seek to ensure that mining activities are carried out in a responsible manner and do not pose a danger to historical monuments.
