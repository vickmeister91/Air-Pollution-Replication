The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industry. One of the petitioners is M/s. Good Luck Green Marbles. The details of the petitions and the court order are not provided in the summary.

However, one of the court orders discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner and other mining lease holders were required to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) of the forest land, which was calculated based on circulars and the stipulations made in the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra). The respondents multiplied the stipulated NPV by 281 hectares while taking into consideration the 62 mining leases, which are lying vacant and also while taking into consideration the roads and miscellaneous places used for infrastructural parking bringing the NPV to Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare. The petitioner and 63 mining lease holders deposited a sum of Rs.8,79,53,196/- on a pro-rata basis at the rate of Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare on 25.10.2017 under protest with the Mining Department.

Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court examines various documents and communications related to the case and hears arguments from both sides. The court ultimately found that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

Another court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for extended period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court heard arguments from the Additional Advocate General and noted that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and approval was given for the entire area valid up to 28.10.2017. The court also noted that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
