The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 Cr. P.C. for quashing the criminal proceeding against the petitioners in B.F. Case No. 47 of 2003 lodged under Sections 33, 41 and 42 of the Indian Forest Act read with Section 2, 3(A) and 3(B) for contravention of the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The prosecution report stated that the petitioners had extracted and mined coal from the Ghanudih protected forest area.

The court heard arguments from both sides and concluded that the petitioners had been allowed by the court to carry out mining activities earlier, and therefore, the present proceeding would amount to an abuse of the process of the court. The court quashed the entire criminal proceeding and the order taking cognizance of the offences against the petitioners.
