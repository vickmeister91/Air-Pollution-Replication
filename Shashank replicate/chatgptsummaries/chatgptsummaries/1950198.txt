The court order pertains to cases where tenants were being evicted from shops on the grounds of change of user. The court examined the grounds for eviction and held that the tenant could be evicted if the shop was being used for a purpose other than that for which it was leased, even if the new purpose was commercial in nature. The court cited several precedents to support this view.

In one of the cases, the tenant had given an undertaking to vacate the premises by a specific date, but had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. The court overruled the objection that the appeal was not maintainable due to the undertaking and proceeded to examine the grounds for eviction. The court held that the tenant could be evicted if the shop was being used for a purpose other than that for which it was leased, even if the new purpose was commercial in nature.

In another case, the court discussed various cases where tenants were held liable for eviction due to a change in the use of the premises let out to them. The court emphasized that a new business activity started by the tenant should either have some linkage with the original business or be an allied business or ancillary to that business. In the present case, the tenant had set up a restaurant in the premises let out to him for a cloth merchant business, which amounted to a change of user. However, since the tenant had reverted back to his original business during the pendency of the eviction proceedings and all other grounds for eviction were negatived, the court allowed the tenant to stay in the premises subject to paying rent at a higher rate.

The court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of adhering to the terms of the lease agreement and using the premises for the purpose for which it was leased. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for tenants to obtain the necessary permissions and approvals before changing the use of the premises.
