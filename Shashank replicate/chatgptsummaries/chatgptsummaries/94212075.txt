The three court orders discussed pertain to cases where the principles of natural justice were violated, leading to adverse orders being passed against the petitioners. The first order pertains to a case where the petitioner, who was appointed as an Anganwadi Worker, had her services discontinued by the respondents without conducting a departmental inquiry. The petitioner argued that the order was bad in law in light of the policy issued by the State Government, which required a charge-sheet or departmental inquiry. The court agreed with the petitioner and cited the principles of natural justice, which require a fair procedure to be followed while exercising decision-making powers. The court also referred to a previous judgment that emphasized the importance of giving notice and a fair opportunity to parties before passing an adverse order.

The second court order discusses the concept of natural justice and its evolution over time. It emphasizes the importance of the principles of "nemo judex in causa sua" (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side) in ensuring a fair hearing. The order notes that natural justice applies not only to judicial acts but also to administrative orders that have civil consequences. The court order also discusses the "useless formality theory" and the debate surrounding the level of proof required to show a breach of natural justice.

The third court order discusses the importance of natural justice and the principles of audi alteram partem, which require that both parties be heard before a decision is made. The court criticizes the "useless formality theory" and emphasizes that natural justice is a fundamental aspect of fair adjudication. The court quashes an order terminating the petitioner's employment, citing the failure to follow prescribed procedures and the absence of any misconduct on the petitioner's part. The petitioner is entitled to backwages and all consequential benefits. The court also directs the respondents to pay the petitioner's salary and sets aside other orders terminating the petitioner's employment.

The common thread running through all three court orders is the importance of natural justice and the principles of audi alteram partem. Natural justice is a fundamental aspect of fair adjudication, and its violation can lead to adverse orders being passed against parties. The principles of audi alteram partem require that both parties be heard before a decision is made, and this is essential to ensure a fair hearing.

The first court order highlights the importance of following prescribed procedures while exercising decision-making powers. The State Government had issued a policy requiring a charge-sheet or departmental inquiry before discontinuing the services of an Anganwadi Worker. The respondents failed to follow this policy, leading to the court quashing the order terminating the petitioner's services. The court emphasized the importance of giving notice and a fair opportunity to parties before passing an adverse order, citing a previous judgment.

The second court order discusses the evolution of natural justice and its application to administrative orders that have civil consequences. The court emphasizes the importance of the principles of "nemo judex in causa sua" and "audi alteram partem" in ensuring a fair hearing. The court notes that natural justice is not a useless formality but a fundamental aspect of fair adjudication. The court also discusses the level of proof required to show a breach of natural justice and the debate surrounding this issue.

The third court order quashes an order terminating the petitioner's employment, citing the failure to follow prescribed procedures and the absence of any misconduct on the petitioner's part. The court emphasizes the importance of natural justice and the principles of audi alteram partem in ensuring a fair hearing. The petitioner is entitled to backwages and all consequential benefits, and the respondents are directed to pay the petitioner's salary. The court sets aside other orders terminating the petitioner's employment.

In conclusion, the three court orders discussed highlight the importance of natural justice and the principles of audi alteram partem in ensuring a fair hearing. The violation of natural justice can lead to adverse orders being passed against parties, and it is essential to follow prescribed procedures while exercising decision-making powers. Natural justice is not a useless formality but a fundamental aspect of fair adjudication, and its evolution over time has led to its application to administrative orders that have civil consequences. The level of proof required to show a breach of natural justice is a matter of debate, but the principles of audi alteram partem require that both parties be heard before a decision is made.
