The case in question involved a petitioner who sought a writ, direction, or order to quash the order of termination passed by the Ratnagiri District Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. The petitioner was challenging the order of termination on various grounds. However, the court found that the bank is not a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and therefore a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot be issued for the purpose of quashing the order of termination. As a result, the writ petition was dismissed on the ground that it was not maintainable.

The petitioner's argument was that the order of termination was passed without following the principles of natural justice and that the bank had acted in a discriminatory manner. The petitioner also argued that the order of termination was passed without any valid reason and that it was arbitrary and capricious. However, the court found that these arguments were not relevant to the issue at hand, which was whether a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution of India could be issued in this case.

The court noted that the bank was not a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. Article 12 defines the term "state" for the purposes of Part III of the Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights. The court held that the bank did not fall within the definition of "state" under Article 12 and therefore a writ under Article 226 could not be issued against it.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order of termination on any other ground, such as breach of contract or violation of any statutory provision. The court held that in the absence of any such challenge, the writ petition was not maintainable.

The court's decision in this case has important implications for employees of cooperative banks. It clarifies that cooperative banks are not considered "state" for the purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and therefore employees of such banks cannot seek relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in case of termination or other employment-related disputes.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that it was not maintainable. The court held that the bank was not a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and therefore a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution of India could not be issued for the purpose of quashing the order of termination. This decision has important implications for employees of cooperative banks and clarifies the legal position with respect to their employment-related disputes.
