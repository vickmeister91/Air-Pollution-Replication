The case in question involves a petition filed by Rakesh Kumar, challenging the order of the trial court that rejected his application for summoning the income tax return of the respondent complainant. The High Court found the petition to be frivolous and aimed at delaying the trial. The respondent complainant had given a pertinent reply stating that he did not file the income tax return for the relevant year. The trial court was justified in rejecting the application, and the petitioner was ordered to pay a cost of Rs. 2000/-, which shall be deposited in the trial court by 4.1.2018. Failure to do so will result in the closure of his defense.
