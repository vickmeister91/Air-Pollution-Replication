The Madras High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two writ petitions filed in the court regarding the pollution caused by tanneries and industries in Tamil Nadu. The petitions sought compensation for affected individuals and families, closure of defaulting industries, and reversal of damage to ecology and infrastructure. The court order provides a brief history of the case, including the directions issued by the Supreme Court in 1996, which led to the constitution of the Loss of Ecology Authority. The Authority was given powers to assess compensation, recover costs from polluters, and frame schemes for reversing damage caused by pollution. The court order also mentions the formation of a "Green Bench" to deal with environmental matters.

The court order directs the state government to implement schemes to reverse the damage caused to the environment and to close down tanneries that have not complied with pollution control measures. The court has also ordered the District Collector to recover compensation from polluting industries and pay it to affected parties. The court has dismissed a probono publico petition filed by the Vellore District Environment Monitoring Committee, stating that it lacked sufficient grounds. The court has also quashed an order passed by the Loss of Ecology Authority with regard to the assessment of damage to ecology in Vellore District beyond 1998.

The court order is a significant step towards addressing the issue of pollution caused by industries in Tamil Nadu. The court has recognized the need for compensation to be paid to affected individuals and families and has directed the state government to implement schemes to reverse the damage caused to the environment. The court has also taken a strong stance against industries that have not complied with pollution control measures and has ordered their closure. The court's decision to dismiss the probono publico petition filed by the Vellore District Environment Monitoring Committee and to quash the order passed by the Loss of Ecology Authority with regard to the assessment of damage to ecology in Vellore District beyond 1998 is a clear indication that the court is committed to ensuring that only valid and well-grounded petitions are entertained.

The court order is also significant in that it provides a brief history of the case and the directions issued by the Supreme Court in 1996. This history is important in understanding the context in which the court order has been issued and the powers that have been granted to the Loss of Ecology Authority. The court order also mentions the formation of a "Green Bench" to deal with environmental matters. This is a positive development as it indicates that the court is taking environmental matters seriously and is committed to addressing them in a timely and effective manner.
