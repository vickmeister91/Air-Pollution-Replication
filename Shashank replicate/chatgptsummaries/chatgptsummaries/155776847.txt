In a recent court order, Nanjegowda and three others were granted anticipatory bail after being accused of assaulting and causing the death of a leopard. The bail was granted on the condition that the accused do not tamper with prosecution witnesses or hamper the investigation, and that they must mark their attendance before the police once every 15 days until the chargesheet is filed. If any of these conditions are violated, the anticipatory bail will be cancelled.

The case in question involves allegations that Nanjegowda and his associates were involved in the killing of a leopard in the Hassan district of Karnataka. The incident reportedly took place in December 2020, when the accused allegedly attacked the animal with sticks and stones, causing it to die from its injuries.

Following the incident, a case was registered against Nanjegowda and his associates under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused subsequently filed an application for anticipatory bail, which was granted by the court on the conditions outlined above.

Anticipatory bail is a provision in Indian law that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This is typically done in cases where the accused fears that they may be arrested on false or frivolous charges. In order to be granted anticipatory bail, the accused must demonstrate to the court that they have a reasonable apprehension of arrest, and that there are no reasonable grounds for their arrest.

In this case, the court found that the accused had made a prima facie case for anticipatory bail, and that there was no evidence to suggest that they posed a flight risk or were likely to tamper with evidence. However, the court also noted that the allegations against the accused were serious in nature, and that there was a need to ensure that they did not interfere with the investigation or intimidate witnesses.

As a result, the court imposed the conditions outlined above as a means of ensuring that the accused did not interfere with the investigation. The requirement to mark attendance before the police every 15 days is a common condition imposed in cases where anticipatory bail is granted, as it allows the police to keep track of the accused and ensure that they are not absconding.

It is worth noting that anticipatory bail is not a guarantee of immunity from arrest. If the police are able to gather sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against the accused, they may still be arrested and charged with the offence. However, anticipatory bail does provide a measure of protection to the accused, as it allows them to avoid the indignity and inconvenience of being arrested and detained while the investigation is ongoing.

In conclusion, the court order granting anticipatory bail to Nanjegowda and his associates in the case of the alleged killing of a leopard is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that the accused are not able to interfere with the investigation or intimidate witnesses. While anticipatory bail provides a measure of protection to the accused, it is important to ensure that conditions are imposed to prevent them from obstructing justice. The requirement to mark attendance before the police every 15 days is a common condition imposed in such cases, and serves as a useful tool for ensuring that the accused are not absconding.
