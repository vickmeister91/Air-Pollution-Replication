The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition that sought a mandamus to prevent interference in the functioning of a brick kiln registered in the name of M/s Akshay Int Udhyog. The Chief Standing Counsel for the State of U.P. stated that all brick kilns in the National Capital Region have stopped pursuant to an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The court found no reason to interfere in the matter and dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner could approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of his grievance.

The writ petition was filed by M/s Akshay Int Udhyog, which operates a brick kiln in the National Capital Region. The petitioner sought a mandamus to prevent interference in the functioning of the brick kiln, which was registered in its name. The petitioner argued that the brick kiln was operating in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that there was no reason for any interference in its functioning.

The Chief Standing Counsel for the State of U.P. submitted that all brick kilns in the National Capital Region had stopped pursuant to an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The order was passed in response to a petition filed by an environmental activist, who had alleged that the brick kilns were causing air pollution and were a major contributor to the smog that envelops the National Capital Region during the winter months.

The court noted that the National Green Tribunal had passed an order directing the closure of all brick kilns in the National Capital Region, and that the order was still in force. The court observed that the petitioner could approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of its grievance, and that there was no reason for the court to interfere in the matter.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, and that it was not open to the court to go into the merits of the order. The court observed that the petitioner could challenge the order before the National Green Tribunal or before the appropriate forum, but that it was not open to the court to entertain a writ petition seeking a mandamus to prevent interference in the functioning of the brick kiln.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by M/s Akshay Int Udhyog seeking a mandamus to prevent interference in the functioning of its brick kiln. The court observed that all brick kilns in the National Capital Region had stopped pursuant to an order passed by the National Green Tribunal, and that the petitioner could approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of its grievance.
