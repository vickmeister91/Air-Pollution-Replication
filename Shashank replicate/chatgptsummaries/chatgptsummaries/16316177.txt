The Rajasthan High Court recently passed an order in a criminal case where the petitioners had challenged an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge directing further investigation into the matter. The petitioners had argued that once cognizance had been taken, no direction for further investigation was permissible. The court held that the power to direct investigation vests only with the Magistrate and not the Sessions Court. 

The case in question pertained to an incident where the accused had allegedly committed offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 341, 427, 452, 307, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The police had filed a charge sheet against the accused, and the case was committed to the Sessions Court for trial. 

During the trial, the Additional Sessions Judge had directed further investigation into the matter, which was challenged by the petitioners. The petitioners had argued that once cognizance had been taken, no direction for further investigation was permissible. The court agreed with the petitioners and held that the power to direct investigation vests only with the Magistrate and not the Sessions Court. 

The court relied on the provisions of Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers a Magistrate to direct the police to investigate a cognizable offence. The court held that once the Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence, the power to direct investigation vests only with the Magistrate and not the Sessions Court. 

The court further held that the Additional Sessions Judge had exceeded his jurisdiction in directing further investigation into the matter. The court quashed the order for further investigation but allowed the prosecution to file an appropriate application for rectifying flaws in the investigation. 

The court's order is significant as it clarifies the powers of the Sessions Court in directing investigation into a criminal case. The court has held that the power to direct investigation vests only with the Magistrate and not the Sessions Court. This is in line with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers a Magistrate to direct the police to investigate a cognizable offence. 

The court's order also highlights the importance of following due process in criminal cases. The court has held that once cognizance has been taken, no direction for further investigation is permissible. This ensures that the investigation is conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and that the accused are not subjected to unnecessary harassment.
