In a recent case, a petitioner filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by a Judicial Magistrate, Rajkhera, Dhoplur, which refused to release a tractor and trolley to the petitioner. The vehicles were case property of a case registered at Police Station Diholi, Dholpur, for various offenses. The petitioner argued that the vehicles should not be left parked in the police station and relied on a Supreme Court judgment to support his argument.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the vehicles to the petitioner with certain conditions. The petitioner was required to keep the vehicles intact, produce them when required by the trial court, and execute a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court was empowered to impose any other conditions it deemed fit. The court also directed the trial court to verify that the petitioner was the registered owner of the vehicles.

The petitioner's argument was based on a Supreme Court judgment that stated that the police should not keep the seized vehicles in their custody for an indefinite period. The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and directed the trial court to release the vehicles to the petitioner. However, the court also imposed certain conditions to ensure that the vehicles were not misused or damaged.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the police should not keep the seized vehicles in their custody for an indefinite period. The court recognized that the petitioner had a legitimate interest in the vehicles and that keeping them in the police station would cause him undue hardship.

The court recognized that the petitioner had a legitimate interest in the vehicles and that he needed them for his livelihood. At the same time, the court recognized that the state had an interest in preserving the vehicles for the trial.
