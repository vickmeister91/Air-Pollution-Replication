The case in question involves a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against Nirmal Kumar Jain for constructing a farm house in violation of a notification. The accused was summoned to face trial and was admitted to bail. However, the trial court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the notification was applicable to the land of the accused and that the construction was made after the issuance of the notification. As a result, the accused was acquitted of the charge.

Following the acquittal, the complainant filed an application seeking leave to file an appeal. However, the court dismissed the application as it was filed belatedly and no justifiable reason for the delay was given.

The case highlights the importance of following regulations and notifications when it comes to construction and development. In this case, the accused was able to successfully argue that the notification did not apply to their land and that the construction was not in violation of any regulations. However, it is important for individuals and organizations to ensure that they are following all applicable regulations and obtaining the necessary permits and approvals before proceeding with any construction or development projects.

Additionally, the case also highlights the importance of timely filing of appeals and providing justifiable reasons for any delays. In this case, the complainant's application for leave to file an appeal was dismissed due to the delay in filing and the lack of a justifiable reason for the delay. This serves as a reminder that individuals and organizations must be diligent in pursuing legal remedies and ensuring that all necessary steps are taken in a timely manner.

Overall, the case serves as a cautionary tale for those involved in construction and development projects. It is important to ensure that all regulations and notifications are followed, and that all necessary permits and approvals are obtained. Additionally, it is important to be diligent in pursuing legal remedies and ensuring that all necessary steps are taken in a timely manner. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences and delays in the development process.
