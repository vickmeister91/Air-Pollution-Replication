The Delhi High Court has been actively involved in addressing the issue of air pollution in the city. The court has issued various orders to reduce pollution levels, including the phasing out of old vehicles and the switch to CNG fuel. The court has also established committees to address pollution and has rejected attempts by the government to delay or discredit the use of CNG fuel. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the precautionary and polluter pays principles. The court also criticizes the government for prioritizing the interests of private industries over public health and the environment.

The court has been particularly concerned with the use of CNG as an alternative fuel to reduce pollution. In one of its orders, the court criticized the government's proposed cut in CNG supply to punish a company whose managing director recommended CNG. The court cited scientific studies linking air pollution to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and emphasized the need to prioritize public health over private industry. The court also highlighted the inadequacy of current fuel testing standards and the prevalence of fuel adulteration in Delhi. The court ordered steps to be taken to improve air quality and reduce pollution.

In another order, the court discussed the issue of adulteration in fuel supplied to Delhi and the need to switch to gas to prevent it. The court ordered the phasing out of diesel buses and the allocation of CNG to the transport sector, with priority given to polluted cities. The government was directed to increase the supply of CNG and prepare a scheme for the supply of clean non-adulterable fuel. The court also directed the implementation of a financing scheme for CNG vans to be run as taxis for SC/ST and weaker sections of society.

The court's orders are a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure that the air in Delhi is safe to breathe. The government must take action to implement the court's orders and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment for all citizens.
