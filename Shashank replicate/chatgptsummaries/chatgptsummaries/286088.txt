In a recent court order, the higher court directed the trial court to summon the Demolition Register in a case where two accused were charged for possessing cartridges without a license. The accused had filed an application to summon the register, claiming that it would nullify the charges against them. The register allegedly showed that the recovered cartridges had been destroyed prior to their recovery from the accused.

The trial court had rejected the application, stating that there was no marking of the word "USD" on the boxes containing the cartridges. However, the higher court found that the production of the Demolition Register was necessary and relevant for the trial and directed the trial court to summon it.
