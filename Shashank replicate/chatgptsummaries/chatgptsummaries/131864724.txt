The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) against M/s Pulak Store for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. During a raid, the accused was found to be using and storing plastic bags, and the case property was seized. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable, but the DPCC argued that it was authorized to file the complaint. The court considered various judgments and relevant provisions of the law and ultimately found the complaint to be maintainable. The court also noted that the objective of the Environmental Legislation is to prevent acts detrimental to the environment and public health.

The second court order discusses two sections of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. Section 19 states that no court can take cognizance of an offense under this act unless a complaint is made by the Central Government, an authorized authority or officer, or a person who has given notice of the alleged offense. Section 24 states that the provisions of this act and its rules will have effect despite anything inconsistent in any other enactment, but if an act or omission constitutes an offense under both this act and another act, the offender will be punished under the other act. The court also cites two cases, one interpreting Section 20(1) of the act and the other discussing the delegation of powers under Section 69(1).

The third court order discusses the delegation of powers under the Municipal Act and the Calcutta Municipal Act. It states that only authorized personnel can file a complaint under the Act and cannot delegate their duties to others unless expressly authorized. The court also notes that technicalities pertaining to non-filing of complaints by authorized personnel cannot be cured at any stage of litigation. The order cites various cases to support its decision.

The fourth court order states that the present complaint filed under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 is not maintainable as it was not filed by a person authorized under the act. The authorization given by the DPCC committee to the complainant was not valid as they exceeded their power and no steps were taken to remove the defect in filing the complaint. The court also mentions that technical objections cannot be ignored and cites previous judgments to support this. As a result, the accused is discharged, and the bail bonds and surety are canceled.

In summary, these court orders deal with complaints filed under various acts and regulations. The first order deals with a complaint filed under the notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The court found the complaint to be maintainable, citing relevant provisions of the law and previous judgments. The second order discusses two sections of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and cites two cases to support its decision. The third order deals with the delegation of powers under the Municipal Act and the Calcutta Municipal Act and cites various cases to support its decision. The fourth order deals with a complaint filed under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and finds it to be not maintainable due to technical objections. Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of following proper procedures and adhering to relevant laws and regulations when filing complaints.
