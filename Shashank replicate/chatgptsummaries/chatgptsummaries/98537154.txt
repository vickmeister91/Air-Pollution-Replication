The court order pertains to multiple cases involving sugar factories in Maharashtra state. The parties involved in each case are listed, including the petitioners and respondents. The cases involve issues related to sugar production and distribution, as well as compliance with government regulations regarding minimum distance between factories.

One case involves a dispute over the setting up of a new sugar factory within a 15 km radius of existing sugar factories. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the proposed factory was more than 15 km away from existing factories, but some individuals challenged this certification. The court considered the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which specify the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory. These include obtaining a certificate from the concerned State Government that the proposed site is at a minimum distance from existing factories, and submitting a performance guarantee for implementation of the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum within a stipulated time.

The court order specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but who have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court also heard arguments regarding the grant of aerial distance certificates to Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji.

Another case involves a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other. The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their factories at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The petitioner argued that the IEM granted to one factory had become inoperative as they had not taken effective steps within the stipulated time period. The court rejected this argument and found that the IEM was still valid.

The court also heard a case involving the construction of a sugar factory on agricultural land in Maharashtra. The petitioner alleged that the factory was being constructed without obtaining necessary permissions from the relevant authorities. The court had earlier restrained the construction and directed the Collector to examine the permissions obtained by the factory owner. The Collector subsequently submitted a report stating that the necessary permissions had been obtained. The factory owner then resumed construction, but the petitioner obtained another order restraining construction on the grounds that the aerial distance certificate did not apply to the changed location of the factory.

In another case, the court found that a sugar factory's change in location was permissible under a government press note, and that the change should be treated as an amendment to the factory's initial application rather than a new application altogether. The court also noted that a public interest litigation filed against the factory was premature, as the factory had not yet begun its first crushing season at the time of the filing.

The court also addressed a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application for an amendment to their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM) to correct the location of their proposed sugar factory. The court determined that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement dated January 12, 2006, was to be treated as a fresh IEM registered in favor of Jaywant for the first time. The court also considered whether Audumbarraoji has taken effective steps within the stipulated period of two years from the date of IEM. The court found that effective steps were taken by Audumbarraoji within the stipulated time. The court also addressed the argument that the Director (Sugar) is not the authority that issues the IEM and that there is no provision for change of location in the IEM. The court found no merit in the Public Interest Litigation No. 23 of 2013 and writ petition.

The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, as long as they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji ultimately receiving one and beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and others, leading to a court order restraining Audumbarraoji from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained. The Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice for objections, and nine were received, mostly from the petitioners in the present writ petitions/PIL.

The court order also pertains to a case involving Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd. against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., and the Union of India. The petitioners have also filed a separate writ petition against various government bodies and officials. The details of the case are not provided in the summary.

In conclusion, the court order addresses multiple cases involving sugar factories in Maharashtra state. The cases involve issues related to sugar production and distribution, as well
