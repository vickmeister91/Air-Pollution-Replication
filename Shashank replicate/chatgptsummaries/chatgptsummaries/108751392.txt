The Bombay High Court recently quashed an order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to stop the activities of Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Ltd. without issuing a show cause notice or providing an opportunity of hearing. The court found the order to be a violation of the principles of natural justice and granted liberty to the board to initiate fresh proceedings after issuing a show cause notice to the petitioner. The court also directed the reconnection of electricity if it had already been disconnected.

The case was brought before the court by Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Ltd., a cement manufacturing company, which had been served with an order by the MPCB to stop its activities due to alleged violations of environmental norms. The company argued that the order was passed without giving them a chance to be heard and without following the principles of natural justice.

The court agreed with the petitioner and observed that the order passed by the MPCB was in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the MPCB had not given the petitioner a show cause notice before passing the order and had not provided them with an opportunity to be heard. The court held that the right to be heard is a fundamental principle of natural justice and cannot be denied to any person.

The court also observed that the MPCB had not followed the procedure laid down under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the MPCB had not conducted any inspection or investigation before passing the order and had relied solely on the complaints received from the local residents. The court held that the MPCB cannot pass an order without conducting an inspection or investigation and without giving the petitioner a chance to be heard.

The court further observed that the order passed by the MPCB had caused irreparable loss to the petitioner as their electricity connection had been disconnected. The court held that the MPCB cannot disconnect the electricity connection without following the due process of law and without giving the petitioner a chance to be heard.

In light of the above observations, the court quashed the order passed by the MPCB and granted liberty to the board to initiate fresh proceedings after issuing a show cause notice to the petitioner. The court also directed the reconnection of electricity if it had already been disconnected.

The judgment of the Bombay High Court is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of following due process of law. The court has made it clear that no order can be passed without giving the affected party a chance to be heard and without following the procedure laid down under the relevant laws. The judgment also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to conduct inspections and investigations before passing any order and to rely on evidence rather than complaints received from the public.
