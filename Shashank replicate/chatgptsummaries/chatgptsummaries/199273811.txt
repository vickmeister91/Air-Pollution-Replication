The case at hand involves M/s Shah Brothers, who were granted a mining lease of Iron Ore over an area of 233.99 Hectare in Karampada Reserve Forest in West Singhbhum district with effect from 10.07.1972 for a period of 30 years. The petitioner applied for the first renewal on 08.07.2001, which remained pending till Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 was enacted. The petitioner's application for renewal of lease has been rejected by Annexure-19 order dated 01.04.2016 contained in Memo No. 882 passed by the Department of Industries, Mines & Geology, Government of Jharkhand. The petitioner has challenged the order on various grounds, including non-compliance with statutory requirements and the Apex Court's interpretation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015. The petitioner has a prima facie case, and the balance of convenience lies in its favor.

The court order grants a lessee three months even if their renewal application is rejected. The order to hand over possession is also invalid. The petitioner has a strong case and will suffer irreparable loss if mining operations are shut down. The court considers the submissions of both parties and finds that there are no directions for premature termination of the lease. The petitioner is entitled to continue their lease for 50 years from the original lease date. The impugned orders are stayed, and the respondent has two weeks to seek instructions and file a counter affidavit. The case is listed for May 5th.
