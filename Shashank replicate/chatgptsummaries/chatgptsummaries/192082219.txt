The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed writ petitions filed by Mysore Fruit Products Pvt Ltd against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner had sought to quash and set aside certain orders and notices issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and to direct the respondents to restore Rajakaluves and ensure free and unobstructed flow of water. However, the court declined to entertain the writ petitions, stating that the order in question was appealable under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and that an alternative statutory remedy was available.

The case revolved around the issue of pollution control and the restoration of Rajakaluves, which are channels that carry rainwater and sewage to lakes and rivers. The petitioner, Mysore Fruit Products Pvt Ltd, had been issued notices by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board for violating pollution control norms and discharging untreated effluent into the Rajakaluves. The petitioner had challenged these notices and orders, claiming that they were arbitrary and illegal.

The court, however, held that the petitioner had an alternative statutory remedy available under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This section provides for an appeal to the National Green Tribunal against orders and notices issued by the State Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy and that the writ petitions were therefore premature.

The court also observed that the restoration of Rajakaluves and the free flow of water were important issues, but that they could not be addressed in the writ petitions. The court stated that these issues could be raised before the National Green Tribunal, which had the expertise and jurisdiction to deal with them.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following the proper legal procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the courts. It also underscores the need for effective pollution control measures and the restoration of natural water channels for the sustainable development of the environment.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's dismissal of the writ petitions filed by Mysore Fruit Products Pvt Ltd against the State of Karnataka and other respondents emphasizes the importance of following the proper legal procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the courts. The court's decision also highlights the need for effective pollution control measures and the restoration of natural water channels for the sustainable development of the environment.
