The first court order pertains to an appeal by the Department of Income Tax against Climate Systems Pvt. Ltd. for the assessment year 2005-06. The appeal concerns the allowance of depreciation on computer peripherals and accessories and the disallowance of royalty expenses. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Delhi heard the appeal and remitted the issue of depreciation to the file of the Assessing Officer (AO) to examine whether the computer peripherals could be used independently or not. The Tribunal directed the AO to keep in mind the directions issued in the case of Simaran Majumdar and Expeditors International and examine the nature and character of the computer peripherals. The AO was also directed to provide the assessee with an opportunity to be heard before deciding the issue and examine the nature of each and every item. The Tribunal directed the AO to decide whether the computer peripherals could be used independently or not and decide the issue of depreciation.

Moving on to the second court order, it discusses two issues. The first issue is related to the payment of technical know-how fee, which the court allows as a deduction since the agreement did not confer any proprietary rights on the assessee. The second issue is related to the expenditure incurred by the assessee on Secure Land Fill Systems (SLFS) for storage of hazardous waste. The court holds that the expenditure is an allowable business expenditure since it was incurred in compliance with the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989. The court also cites several case laws to support its decision.

The third court order confirms that the expenditure incurred by the assessee for managing hazardous waste is a statutory requirement enabling the assessee to carry on its business. The court cites previous cases where expenditure for promoting health and welfare of workers, water treatment plant, and plantation in factory premises were considered revenue expenditure. The court rejects the Department's appeal and partly allows it.

In summary, the court orders discussed various issues related to income tax and business expenditure. The first court order dealt with the allowance of depreciation on computer peripherals and accessories and the disallowance of royalty expenses. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal directed the Assessing Officer to examine the nature and character of the computer peripherals and decide whether they could be used independently or not. The second court order allowed the deduction of technical know-how fee and considered the expenditure incurred by the assessee on Secure Land Fill Systems (SLFS) for storage of hazardous waste as an allowable business expenditure. The third court order confirmed that the expenditure incurred by the assessee for managing hazardous waste is a statutory requirement enabling the assessee to carry on its business and rejected the Department's appeal. Overall, the court orders provide guidance on various income tax and business expenditure issues and cite relevant case laws to support their decisions.
