The case at hand involves a petitioner who is seeking relief from notices issued by the second and third respondents. These notices were issued while an appeal was pending regarding the refusal to issue a license for a pig farm. The petitioner is unhappy with the notices and has filed a writ petition seeking relief.

During the proceedings, the court grants the petitioner permission to apply for interim relief in the appeal. This means that the petitioner can seek temporary relief while the appeal is ongoing.
