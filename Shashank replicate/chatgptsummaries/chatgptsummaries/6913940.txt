The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case involving M/S Maha Laxmi Stone Crushing and the State of Uttar Pradesh regarding the operation of a mini stone crusher. The unit had been ordered to be closed by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board in 2015 for violating environmental conditions, but the closure order was later set aside. However, subsequent inspections found that the unit was located within 100 meters of a national highway, which violated applicable norms. The Chief Environment Officer of the U.P. Pollution Control Board ordered the closure of the unit in August 2019 and withdrew electricity and water supply.

The petitioner filed a writ petition, which was disposed of with the direction that the Chief Environment Officer consider the recommendations of inspection committees and any objections filed by the petitioner before making a decision. The court order allowed the petitioner to submit a detailed representation along with a certified copy of the order within two weeks. The Chief Environment Officer was then required to make a decision in accordance with the law.

The petitioner submitted a representation, but it was rejected by the Chief Environment Officer. The petitioner argued that the rejection was a violation of natural justice and discrimination. However, the court found no merit in the arguments and dismissed the petition. The court also stated that it cannot perpetuate an illegality.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to environmental norms and regulations. The closure of the unit was ordered due to its violation of environmental conditions, and subsequent inspections found that it was also in violation of applicable norms regarding its location. The Chief Environment Officer's decision to withdraw electricity and water supply was a necessary step to ensure compliance with these regulations.

The court's direction to consider the recommendations of inspection committees and any objections filed by the petitioner before making a decision is a fair and just approach. It allows for all relevant information to be taken into account before a decision is made, ensuring that the decision is based on a complete understanding of the situation.

However, the rejection of the petitioner's representation highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to natural justice. The court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments, but it is important to ensure that all parties are given a fair hearing and that decisions are made in accordance with the law.

Overall, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental regulations and the need to adhere to them. It also highlights the importance of due process and natural justice in decision-making processes.
