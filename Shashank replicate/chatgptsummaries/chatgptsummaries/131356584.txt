The Society for Promotion of Equality filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against various respondents, including the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) and the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, seeking the demolition of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in Mumbai and restoration of the stadium to its original state. The petitioner also requested an investigation into the approvals granted by the Municipal Corporation for the stadium's reconstruction and the registration of a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act against various officers. The stadium was originally a velodrome for cycling enthusiasts and was later acquired by the NSCI.

The court order discusses the promotion of sports and the construction of buildings for sports activities on a plot of land granted to the NSCI by the Municipal Corporation. The NSCI proposed the reconstruction of a dilapidated stadium and obtained permission from the State Government and the Municipal Corporation. The Municipal Corporation issued a Commencement Certificate for the reconstruction, subject to certain conditions. The Fire Department also issued a NOC for the reconstruction. The plan was approved for the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, and amended plans were submitted and approved subject to conditions.

The court order discusses a PIL filed against the construction of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium. The respondent, NSCI, raised a preliminary objection about the delay in challenging the IOD granted by the Municipal Corporation in 2003. The construction of the stadium and ancillary use is complete on the ground floor and two upper floors, and an occupation certificate is also granted by the Municipal Corporation. The court finds that there is gross delay on the part of the petitioner in filing this PIL, and the only explanation offered is unsatisfactory. The court also notes that during the period of delay, respondent no.1 has completed construction up to 90% at a huge investment and engaged several persons for the work of construction, thereby creating interests of third parties. The court considers dismissing the PIL based on these circumstances.

The court order states that delay and laches on the part of the writ petitioners can result in the dismissal of public interest litigations. The court also considers the equitable principles underlying public interest litigations and the importance of timely action in certain cases. The court then discusses the specific case at hand, where the petitioner claims that the construction of a stadium by respondent no.1, NSCI, violates various regulations and deprives the public of a recreation ground. The court notes that the petitioner's delay in bringing the matter to court is questionable and that the petition may be dismissed on this ground alone. However, the court also considers the merits of the case and the alleged violations of regulations by NSCI.

The court order pertains to a PIL filed in 2010 regarding objections to FSI (Floor Space Index) rules. The petitioner alleges that the area statement submitted for construction is incorrect and that the FSI used by respondent no.1 is higher than what is permitted under the Coastal Zone Management Plan. However, the Urban Development Department of the Government of Maharashtra granted a "No-Objection Certificate" for reconstruction of the property of SVP Stadium, subject to conditions. The petitioner also objects to the calculation of the total area available for construction on the land, stating that the procedure adopted by the Architect of respondent no.1 is incorrect and not prescribed by law. The court holds that where a statute prescribes a certain procedure for something, the same must be adhered to and there can be no deviation therefrom.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the construction of a stadium and ancillary buildings on a plot of land. The petitioner argues that the construction is beyond the legally permissible limit and that there is a violation of the lease agreement due to excavation in a Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) area. The respondents deny these allegations and argue that the construction was approved by relevant authorities and that there was no violation of the lease agreement or CRZ regulations. The court finds no merit in the petitioner's grievances and rules in favor of the respondents.

The court order pertains to a petition filed against the construction of a closed-door stadium by the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) in Mumbai. The petitioner alleged violations of lease conditions, Coastal Zone Management Plan, and public trust doctrine. The court rejected the allegations and allowed the construction to continue, stating that the interpretation of the lease conditions was incorrect, the construction was a reconstruction of the existing structure, and the NSCI had not changed the existing use of the stadium. The court also accepted the NSCI's statements regarding the future use of the premises and the commercial activities planned in the stadium.

The court order reiterates that natural resources are held by the state as a trustee on behalf of the people and cannot be transferred to private parties if it interferes with the public's right to access them. The case involves a dispute over the use of a stadium and surrounding facilities, which were leased to a private club but also meant to be open for public use. The lease deed allows for construction and use of the buildings for specific purposes, including sports and club activities, but not for any business or trade without the consent of the commissioner. The club is also permitted to run a liquor bar for its members, but must pay scheduled charges to the municipal corporation. The stadium is meant to be open for use by school children and sports organizations on non-event days and for at least fifteen special events per year.
