The court order pertains to a grievance filed by a petitioner who alleges that respondents are obstructing the installation of machinery for a resin manufacturing unit. The respondents argue that the permission granted to the petitioner is not legal and that the factory in question is not suitable for manufacturing a toxic substance. The court rules in favor of the petitioner and directs the respondents to provide police protection against any obstruction to the installation works as permitted in the permission granted. However, the court clarifies that this does not allow the petitioner to start functioning of the industrial unit unless required consents/permissions and licenses are obtained from competent authorities. The court also allows the respondents to challenge the permission granted and to object to the grant of consent or license for functioning of the industry or for commencement of production.
