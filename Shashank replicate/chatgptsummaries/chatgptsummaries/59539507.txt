In a recent court order, a truck owner filed an application under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking quashment of an order that resulted in the seizure of his truck by the police for illegal transportation of sand. The court directed that the truck be released on supurdiginama, subject to certain conditions.

The first condition was that the truck owner must furnish a personal bond and a bank guarantee. The second condition was that the owner must undertake not to transfer ownership or lease the vehicle to anyone. The third condition was that the owner must produce the original registration and sale-letter of the vehicle. Finally, the owner must get the vehicle photographed in the presence of a responsible officer.

The court order was sent to the trial court for necessary compliance. This means that the trial court must ensure that the truck owner complies with all the conditions set forth in the court order before releasing the truck.

The court's decision to release the truck on supurdiginama is significant because it allows the owner to retain possession of the vehicle while the case is pending. This is important because the owner may need the truck for his livelihood or other purposes.

However, the court's decision to impose conditions on the release of the truck is also significant. The conditions are designed to ensure that the owner does not use the truck for illegal purposes in the future. The personal bond and bank guarantee are intended to ensure that the owner appears in court when required and pays any fines or penalties that may be imposed. The undertaking not to transfer ownership or lease the vehicle is intended to prevent the owner from selling or renting the truck to someone who may use it for illegal purposes. Finally, the requirement to produce the original registration and sale-letter and get the vehicle photographed in the presence of a responsible officer is intended to ensure that the owner is the rightful owner of the vehicle and that it is not stolen or being used for illegal purposes.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is significant because it allows the truck owner to retain possession of his vehicle while the case is pending. However, the court has also imposed conditions on the release of the truck to ensure that it is not used for illegal purposes in the future. The trial court must ensure that the owner complies with all the conditions set forth in the court order before releasing the truck.
