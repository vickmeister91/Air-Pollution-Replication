In a recent court order, the petitioners requested the quashing of criminal proceedings against them for allegedly encroaching on forest land and constructing a boundary wall without permission. The court noted that there were disputes over the right, title, and interest over the land, and that the title suit was still pending. Ultimately, the court set aside the proceedings against the petitioners.

The case in question involved allegations of encroachment on forest land and the construction of a boundary wall without permission. The petitioners argued that the criminal proceedings against them should be quashed, as there were disputes over the right, title, and interest over the land in question. The court agreed, noting that the title suit was still pending and that there were significant disputes over the ownership of the land.

The court's decision to set aside the proceedings against the petitioners was based on several factors. First, the court noted that the title suit was still pending, and that until the ownership of the land was determined, it was difficult to say whether the petitioners had actually encroached on forest land. Second, the court noted that there were significant disputes over the right, title, and interest over the land, and that these disputes needed to be resolved before any criminal proceedings could be pursued.

Overall, the court's decision to set aside the proceedings against the petitioners was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case. The court recognized that there were significant disputes over the ownership of the land in question, and that until these disputes were resolved, it was difficult to say whether the petitioners had actually encroached on forest land. As a result, the court concluded that the criminal proceedings against the petitioners should be quashed.

This court order highlights the importance of resolving disputes over land ownership before pursuing criminal proceedings. In cases where there are significant disputes over the right, title, and interest over land, it may be difficult to determine whether criminal activity has actually taken place. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the facts of each case and to ensure that all relevant disputes are resolved before pursuing criminal charges.
