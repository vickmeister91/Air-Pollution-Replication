The court order pertains to a petition filed by Satish Kumar Sood against the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the Special Environment Court, Faridabad, which had summoned him to face trial for violating environmental protection rules. The petitioner argued that the company he was associated with had obtained an environment clearance certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, which was not considered by the trial court. The petitioner also relied on a previous judgment of the court to argue that the complaint against him was vague and did not disclose a cognizable offense. The court reserved its judgment on the matter.

In this case, the petitioner had obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate before starting their construction project, but a complaint was filed against them for not obtaining it. However, the complaint did not mention when the construction project was started and the petitioner had already obtained the certificate before the complaint was filed. The court found that the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioner would be an abuse of process of law and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings. The court also found that the trial court had passed the summoning order without application of judicial mind.

The court order dismisses a revision petition and sends the lower court record back. The petitioner had an opportunity to argue their case before the trial court at the stage of framing of charge. The court finds that the allegations against the petitioner are vague and orders the complaint and all subsequent proceedings to be quashed.

The above three court orders deal with cases related to environmental protection rules and regulations. In the first case, the petitioner had been summoned to face trial for violating environmental protection rules. The petitioner argued that the company he was associated with had obtained an environment clearance certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, which was not considered by the trial court. The petitioner also relied on a previous judgment of the court to argue that the complaint against him was vague and did not disclose a cognizable offense. The court reserved its judgment on the matter.

In the second case, the petitioner had obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate before starting their construction project, but a complaint was filed against them for not obtaining it. However, the complaint did not mention when the construction project was started and the petitioner had already obtained the certificate before the complaint was filed. The court found that the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioner would be an abuse of process of law and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings. The court also found that the trial court had passed the summoning order without application of judicial mind.

In the third case, the court order dismisses a revision petition and sends the lower court record back. The petitioner had an opportunity to argue their case before the trial court at the stage of framing of charge.

The common thread running through all three cases is the importance of following due process of law and ensuring that the allegations made against the accused are specific and clear. In the first case, the petitioner argued that the complaint against him was vague and did not disclose a cognizable offense. In the second case, the court found that the complaint did not mention when the construction project was started and the petitioner had already obtained the certificate before the complaint was filed.
