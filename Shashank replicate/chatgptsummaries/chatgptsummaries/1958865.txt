The case between J. Johnson and A. George revolves around a dispute over a pathway that belongs to Johnson's property. Johnson filed a suit seeking a permanent injunction against George from constructing a compound wall enclosing the pathway. The trial court granted the injunction, but the first appellate court set it aside, and Johnson appealed to the High Court.

The High Court heard the appeal and found that there was no evidence to prove the existence of the pathway from time immemorial. Therefore, Johnson was not entitled to the injunction. The court dismissed the appeal.

The dispute between Johnson and George centers around the ownership of the pathway. Johnson claims that the pathway belongs to his property and that George has no right to construct a compound wall enclosing it. George, on the other hand, argues that the pathway is a public pathway and that he has the right to construct a compound wall around it.

The trial court initially granted the injunction sought by Johnson, preventing George from constructing the compound wall. However, the first appellate court set aside the injunction, ruling that Johnson had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the pathway belonged to his property.

Johnson appealed to the High Court, arguing that the appellate court had erred in its ruling. He claimed that the pathway had been in existence from time immemorial and that he had always used it as part of his property. He also argued that George had no right to construct a compound wall around the pathway, as it would prevent him from accessing his property.

The High Court heard the appeal and considered the evidence presented by both parties. After reviewing the evidence, the court found that there was no proof that the pathway had existed from time immemorial. Therefore, Johnson was not entitled to the injunction he had sought.

The court also noted that George had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the pathway was a public pathway. However, the court found that this was not relevant to the case, as Johnson had failed to prove that the pathway belonged to his property.

In dismissing the appeal, the High Court emphasized the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims in court. The court noted that Johnson had failed to provide any evidence to prove that the pathway belonged to his property, and therefore, he was not entitled to the injunction he had sought.

The case between Johnson and George highlights the importance of establishing ownership of property in legal disputes. In order to succeed in a case like this, it is essential to provide sufficient evidence to prove ownership of the property in question. Without such evidence, it is difficult to establish a legal claim and obtain a favorable ruling from the court.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between J. Johnson and A. George highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support legal claims. In this case, Johnson failed to provide evidence to prove that the pathway belonged to his property, and therefore, he was not entitled to the injunction he had sought. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of establishing ownership of property in legal disputes and the need to provide sufficient evidence to support legal claims.
