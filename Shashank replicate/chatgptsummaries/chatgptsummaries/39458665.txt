The court has granted bail to four applicants in a criminal case, citing several factors that support their entitlement to it. The court considered the severity of punishment in case of conviction, the nature of supporting evidence, and the reasonable apprehension of tampering of witnesses. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicants, including the requirement to furnish personal bonds with two heavy sureties each and to follow certain conditions, such as not seeking adjournments and remaining present before the trial court on each date fixed.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court noted that the applicants had been charged with serious offenses, but that the severity of punishment in case of conviction did not necessarily mean that they should be denied bail. The court also considered the nature of the supporting evidence, which it found to be insufficient to establish a prima facie case against the applicants. Finally, the court noted that there was a reasonable apprehension of tampering of witnesses, which further supported the grant of bail.

In imposing conditions on the applicants, the court sought to ensure that they would not abuse the liberty of bail. The court warned that any abuse of liberty of bail would result in legal action. The court also required the applicants to furnish personal bonds with two heavy sureties each, which would serve as a guarantee of their appearance before the trial court. The court further required the applicants to follow certain conditions, such as not seeking adjournments and remaining present before the trial court on each date fixed.

The court's decision to grant bail is significant because it recognizes the importance of balancing the interests of justice with the rights of the accused. The court recognized that the applicants were entitled to the presumption of innocence and that their liberty should not be unduly restricted unless there was a compelling reason to do so. The court's decision also reflects a commitment to ensuring that the criminal justice system operates fairly and efficiently.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the four applicants in the criminal case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case.
