The National Green Tribunal (NGT) received four applications regarding the proposed widening of sectoral roads in Gurgaon, India, which involved cutting down trees in front of the National Media Centre (NMC). The project proponents were Haryana Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF Ltd. The applicants argued that cutting the trees would cause significant air and noise pollution problems due to traffic movement in the area. The NGT passed an order restraining the respondents from cutting/felling or uprooting any tree on the site. The applicants also alleged violations of numerous environmental obligations by the respondents in respect of the road widening project in Gurgaon. The respondents included the Union of India, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, and DLF Limited.

The court order discusses a dispute over the widening of a road in Gurgaon, India, which involves cutting down trees in a green belt area. The applicant argues that the National Forest Policy requires the maintenance of green belts in urban areas and accuses the Forest Department of granting permission to cut down trees without proper verification. The court orders the State of Haryana to file an affidavit clarifying whether the disputed land is part of forest land. The applicant also raises concerns about the type of trees being planted for compensatory afforestation and the need for an Environmental Clearance for the project. The court considers arguments from both sides and cites relevant laws and policies.

The court order discusses a dispute over a road widening project that involves cutting down trees in a green belt area. The project proponent argues that the Forest Conservation Act and environmental regulations do not apply, while the applicant's advocate argues that international treaties and the Indian Constitution's Article 21 are relevant. The court addresses several issues, including whether the land is forest land, whether proper permission was obtained for cutting trees, whether residents will be affected, and whether afforestation work will be undertaken. The court ultimately rules that the project can proceed with compensatory afforestation and measures to mitigate noise pollution.

The court order addresses the issue of the reduction of green cover in Gurgaon due to the cutting of trees by HUDA and other departments. The court calls for the Forest Department and HUDA to make environmental issues a necessary component of project planning and to undertake afforestation work. The court also emphasizes the concept of sustainable development and the need to balance development with environmental concerns. The court allows the widening of the road project but imposes environmental safeguards, including afforestation work, noise prevention measures, and internalization of environmental issues at the planning stage. The concerned departments are required to submit a compliance report within six months.
