The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by different companies against the Central Pollution Control Board and Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. Both petitions relate to the closure of the petitioners' units due to air pollution caused by fugitive emissions. 

In the first petition filed by M/s. Prabhu Coke Manufacturing Co., the petitioner sought to quash an order issued by the Chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board directing the closure of their unit. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without affording them an opportunity of hearing and without providing them with copies of the inspection report and laboratory test report. 

The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the impugned order was passed in violation of principles of natural justice. The court referred to Rule 4 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, which prescribes the procedure for passing orders under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court observed that the respondents had failed to bring any document on record to suggest that any opportunity of hearing was afforded to the petitioner. The court directed the respondents to comply with the procedure prescribed under Rule 4 and provide the petitioner with an opportunity of hearing. 

In the second petition, the court found that the respondent no.2 had passed the impugned order without providing any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner nor recording the reason in writing for waiving the same on the ground of likelihood of grave injury to the environment. The court quashed the impugned order and remanded the matter to the respondent no.2 to pass a fresh order after providing due opportunity of hearing to the petitioner strictly following the procedure prescribed under Rule 4 of the Rules, 1986, expeditiously. The operation of the concerned unit of the petitioner shall remain suspended till passing of the fresh order by the respondent no.2. 

Both court orders highlight the importance of following due process and providing an opportunity of hearing to the concerned parties before passing any orders under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court emphasized the need to strictly adhere to the procedure prescribed under Rule 4 of the Rules, 1986, which requires that a person concerned be served with a copy of the proposed direction and given an opportunity of not less than fifteen days from the date of service of notice to file objection before passing the direction under Section 5 of the Act, 1986. 

The court's decision to quash the impugned orders and remand the matters to the respondents to pass fresh orders after providing due opportunity of hearing to the petitioners sends a strong message to regulatory bodies to follow due process and ensure that the principles of natural justice are upheld. It also highlights the need for companies to take responsibility for their actions and ensure that they comply with environmental regulations to prevent harm to the environment and public health.
