The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industries. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court examined the facts of the case and the relevant policies and regulations before making its decision.

One of the petitions pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking relief from the demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department.

The court found that only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of Net Present Value (NPV) shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the cluster of mining leases has been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and therefore the compensation should be paid by the remaining lease holders.

Another petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

The court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court examined the facts of the case and the relevant policies and regulations before making its decision. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
