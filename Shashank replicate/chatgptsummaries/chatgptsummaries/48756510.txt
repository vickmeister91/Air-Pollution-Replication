The court order pertains to multiple criminal appeals filed by M/S. India Steel & Alloys against M/S. Venkatesa Industrial Suppliers. The complainant alleged that the respondents owed them over Rs. 1 crore for steel purchases and issued 10 post-dated cheques towards the payment, which were dishonored. The trial court convicted the respondents under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, but the appellate court reversed the decision, stating that the complainant failed to prove the existence of a legally enforceable liability. The appellant argued that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption under section 139 of the Act. The court reserved its judgment.

The court order discusses the burden of proof in a case where the appellant claims that the respondent owes them a certain amount of money. The court states that the appellant must prove the existence of a legally enforceable liability before the respondent can be expected to rebut the presumption. The court also discusses the law relating to burden of proof under sections 118 and 139 of the N.I.Act and cites several cases to support its decision. Ultimately, the court finds that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption and therefore, the appellant is entitled to the amount claimed.

In this case, the complainant alleged that the respondents owed them over Rs. 1 crore for steel purchases and issued 10 post-dated cheques towards the payment, which were dishonored. The trial court convicted the respondents under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonor of cheques. However, the appellate court reversed the decision, stating that the complainant failed to prove the existence of a legally enforceable liability.

The appellant argued that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption under section 139 of the Act, which states that in case of dishonor of a cheque, it is presumed that the cheque was issued for a legally enforceable liability. The court noted that the burden of proof is on the appellant to prove the existence of a legally enforceable liability before the respondent can be expected to rebut the presumption.

The court discussed the law relating to burden of proof under sections 118 and 139 of the N.I.Act and cited several cases to support its decision. The court noted that the burden of proof under section 118 is on the person who makes the assertion, while the burden of proof under section 139 is on the person who issues the cheque. The court also noted that the presumption under section 139 is a rebuttable presumption and can be rebutted by the respondent.

Ultimately, the court found that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption and therefore, the appellant is entitled to the amount claimed. The court held that the trial court's decision was correct and set aside the appellate court's decision.

In another case discussed in the court order, the respondent had issued cheques as security, but later claimed that they had only signed the cheques and the appellant had filled in the details. The court found that the dates on the cheques had been altered and counter-signed by the respondent, indicating that they had not been blank when signed. The court also noted that the respondent had not demanded the return of the cheques after receiving a notice to pay the amount due, which suggested that the cheques had been issued towards a legally enforceable liability.

The court held that the respondent had failed to rebut the presumption of liability and that the burden of proof had not shifted to the appellant. The court also rejected the respondent's argument that the non-production of a Memorandum of Understanding between the parties meant that there was no consideration for the cheques. The court set aside the judgments of the lower courts and sustained the convictions and sentences imposed by the trial court.

In conclusion, the court order discusses the burden of proof in cases where the appellant claims that the respondent owes them a certain amount of money. The court notes that the burden of proof is on the appellant to prove the existence of a legally enforceable liability before the respondent can be expected to rebut the presumption. The court also discusses the law relating to burden of proof under sections 118 and 139 of the N.I.Act and cites several cases to support its decision. The court ultimately finds that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption and therefore, the appellant is entitled to the amount claimed.
