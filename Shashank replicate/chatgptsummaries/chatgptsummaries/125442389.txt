The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently considered a writ petition filed by M/s Pacific Exports against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others. The petitioner had obtained necessary permissions for mining work and regularly submitted statements and paid royalties. However, the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had issued communications limiting the production capacity of minerals to 80,640 tonnes per annum. The petitioner challenged this order and sought its quashment.

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, ordered the quashment of the communications issued by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The court also referred to a previous decision in a similar case and allowed the petitioner to remove overburden and mining material already lying on the spot. The court discussed the requirement of consent from the Pollution Control Board for production of iron ore and other minerals and the need for environmental clearance from the Central Government or State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority for mining lease areas of 5 hectares or more.

The court order states that mining activities in lease areas of less than 5 hectares may be permitted subject to obtaining consent from the State Pollution Control Board. For lease areas of 5 hectares or more, clearance must be obtained from the Central Government or State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority. The order also allows for the transportation of materials excavated prior to a certain date and directs authorities to allow the removal of overburden from the spot on payment of royalty.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the requirement of consent and clearance for mining activities. The court has emphasized the need for environmental protection and has laid down clear guidelines for mining activities in the state. The court has also recognized the importance of the mining industry for the state's economy and has sought to balance the interests of all stakeholders.

The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the mining industry in the state. The order will provide clarity on the legal requirements for mining activities and will help to streamline the regulatory process. The order will also provide relief to mining companies that have been affected by the restrictions imposed by the Pollution Control Board.

The court's decision is a welcome development for the mining industry in the state. The order provides a clear framework for mining activities and will help to promote sustainable development in the state. The court has recognized the importance of environmental protection and has sought to balance the interests of all stakeholders. The matter is listed for final hearing in due course, and it will be interesting to see how the case develops.
