The court order pertains to three writ petitions that raise a common question of law regarding the procedure adopted by the Assessing Officer (AO) while referring to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) under Section 92 CA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The case involves the determination of the Arm's Length Price (ALP) of the international transaction entered into by the Petitioner Assessee with its Associated Enterprise (AE). The Petitioner Assessee challenges the legality of the reference made by the AO to the TPO under Section 92CA of the Act. The court hears arguments from both sides regarding the requirement of giving the Petitioner a hearing before making a reference to the TPO.

The court emphasizes that the AO must be satisfied that the Assessee has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction before making a reference to the TPO. If the Assessee raises an objection to the jurisdiction of the AO to make the reference, the AO must deal with such an objection on merits and give the Assessee an opportunity to be heard before making the reference. The court also discusses a previous case where the jurisdiction of the AO to make a reference was challenged.

The court further discusses the requirement for the Assessing Officer to provide the Assessee with an opportunity to be heard before making a reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) for determination of the Arm's Length Price (ALP) of international transactions. The court cites the Vodafone India Services case and the CBDT's Instruction No. 3 of 2016 as clarifying the correct legal position. The court sets aside three references made by the Assessing Officer to the TPO for determination of the ALP of international transactions involving the Petitioner and its Associated Enterprise (AE) for the AYs 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14, and orders the Assessing Officer to provide the Petitioner with an opportunity to be heard before making a fresh decision on whether to make a reference to the TPO.

In summary, the court order deals with the procedure to be followed by the Assessing Officer while referring to the Transfer Pricing Officer under Section 92CA of the Income Tax Act. The court emphasizes the importance of giving the Assessee a hearing before making a reference to the TPO and sets aside three references made by the Assessing Officer for determination of the Arm's Length Price of international transactions. The court also clarifies the correct legal position on the jurisdiction of the AO to make a reference and emphasizes the need for the AO to be satisfied that the Assessee has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction before making a reference to the TPO.
