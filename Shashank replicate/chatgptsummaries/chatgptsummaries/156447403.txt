The court order in question pertains to an application made under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) by Bhoopendra Singh, who had been arrested for possession of meat from three deer along with other items. Singh's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and that his case was identical to that of a co-accused who had been granted bail. The court allowed the application and directed Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a surety in the same amount.

The order also listed several conditions that Singh must comply with, including cooperating in the investigation/trial and not committing a similar offence. A copy of the order was sent to the court concerned for compliance.

Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the High Court or a Court of Session to grant bail in non-bailable offences. The section states that when any person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a court other than the High Court or Court of Session, he may be released on bail if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.

In this case, Singh's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and that his case was identical to that of a co-accused who had been granted bail. The court considered these arguments and allowed the application for bail, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions listed in the court order are standard conditions that are often imposed when granting bail. These conditions are designed to ensure that the accused does not abscond or interfere with the investigation/trial. The conditions also serve as a deterrent to prevent the accused from committing a similar offence while on bail.

The first condition listed in the court order is that Singh must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a surety in the same amount. This is a financial guarantee that Singh will appear in court when required and will not abscond. The second condition is that Singh must cooperate in the investigation/trial. This means that he must attend all court hearings and provide any information or evidence that is required by the investigating agency or the court.

The third condition is that Singh must not commit a similar offence while on bail. This is a standard condition that is imposed to prevent the accused from committing another offence while on bail. If Singh were to commit another offence while on bail, his bail could be revoked and he could be sent back to jail.

The court order also states that a copy of the order must be sent to the court concerned for compliance. This means that the court that is hearing Singh's case must be informed of the bail order and must ensure that Singh complies with the conditions listed in the order.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application made under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. by Bhoopendra Singh, who had been arrested for possession of meat from three deer along with other items. Singh's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and that his case was identical to that of a co-accused who had been granted bail.
