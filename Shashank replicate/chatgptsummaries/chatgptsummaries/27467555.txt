The court order in question relates to a petition that challenged an order passed by the District Judge, Puri in R.F.A.No.45 of 2008. The petitioner, who was not a party to the suit, claimed to be the adopted son of Nishamani Tripathy and was aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the learned trial court. The court quashed the order and granted leave to hear the appeal on merit.

The case at hand involved a dispute over the property of Nishamani Tripathy, who had passed away. The petitioner claimed to be her adopted son and therefore entitled to a share of her property. However, the trial court had ruled against him, stating that he had failed to prove his adoption.

The petitioner then filed an appeal before the District Judge, Puri, challenging the trial court's decision. However, the District Judge dismissed the appeal, stating that the petitioner had not provided sufficient evidence to prove his adoption.

The petitioner then filed a petition before the High Court, challenging the District Judge's order. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, quashed the order and granted leave to hear the appeal on merit.

The High Court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had produced some evidence to support his claim of adoption, which had not been considered by the lower courts. The High Court also noted that the trial court had not given the petitioner a fair opportunity to present his case.

The High Court's decision to grant leave to hear the appeal on merit means that the petitioner will now have the opportunity to present his case before the court and argue for his right to a share of Nishamani Tripathy's property. The court will consider all the evidence presented by both parties and make a decision based on the merits of the case.

Overall, the court order in question is significant because it highlights the importance of giving all parties a fair opportunity to present their case and have their evidence considered. It also emphasizes the need for courts to carefully consider all the evidence before making a decision, particularly in cases involving property disputes.
