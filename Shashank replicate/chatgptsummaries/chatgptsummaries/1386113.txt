Late Sankaran had filed an original application for the assignment of 14 cents of land for the beneficial enjoyment of his Karaima under the Amended Act 16 of 1989. However, the Land Tribunal dismissed the application on the grounds that it was hit by res judicata. Sankaran then appealed this decision by filing A.A. No. 64 of 1992 before the Appellate Authority (LR), Kozhikode. Unfortunately, the Appellate Authority confirmed the order of the Land Tribunal and dismissed the appeal.

However, the court found that the application was not hit by res judicata and set aside the judgment in A.A. No. 64 of 1992 of the Appellate Authority and the order of the Land Tribunal, Kozhikode in O.A. No. 326 of 1990. The case was then remanded before the Land Tribunal for fresh disposal in accordance with the law.

The case of Late Sankaran is an example of how the legal system can sometimes fail to provide justice to those who need it. The Land Tribunal's decision to dismiss Sankaran's application on the grounds of res judicata was clearly incorrect, as the court later found. This highlights the importance of having a fair and impartial legal system that is capable of providing justice to all.

Res judicata is a legal principle that prevents a case from being re-litigated once it has been decided by a court. In Sankaran's case, the Land Tribunal had dismissed his application on the grounds that it was hit by res judicata. However, the court later found that this was not the case and that Sankaran's application should have been considered on its merits.

The court's decision to set aside the judgment in A.A. No. 64 of 1992 and the order of the Land Tribunal, Kozhikode in O.A. No. 326 of 1990 was a victory for Late Sankaran and his family. It meant that his application for the assignment of 14 cents of land could be considered once again, and that he had a chance to receive the justice he deserved.

The legal system is designed to provide justice to all, regardless of their background or circumstances. However, it is not always perfect, and sometimes mistakes are made. In Sankaran's case, the Land Tribunal's decision to dismiss his application on the grounds of res judicata was a mistake, and it took the court's intervention to correct it.

Overall, the case of Late Sankaran highlights the importance of having a fair and impartial legal system that is capable of providing justice to all. It also shows that mistakes can be made, and that it is important to have a system in place to correct them when they occur. In the end, justice prevailed, and Sankaran's application was given the consideration it deserved.
