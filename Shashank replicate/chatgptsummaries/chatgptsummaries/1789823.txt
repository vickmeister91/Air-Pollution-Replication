The case in question involves a CRLMC filed by the petitioners seeking to quash an order passed by the Sessions Judge, Dhenkanal in a criminal trial. The trial had already commenced and some witnesses had already been examined. The petitioners sought to summon five witnesses and call for some documents, but the Court below disposed of both petitions by a common order. The Court below allowed the petitioners to examine two witnesses but did not find it necessary to summon official witnesses.

The petitioners contended that the Court below had erred in not summoning the official witnesses and that this had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. They argued that the official witnesses were necessary to prove their case and that the Court below had not given sufficient reasons for not summoning them.

The Court, however, held that the accused should be given the opportunity to adduce their evidence, and if there were documents that revealed their innocence, they could produce certified copies of those documents and get them exhibited in consonance with the Evidence Act. The Court further held that the petitioners had not shown any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order and granted liberty to the petitioners to produce certified copies of relevant documents.

The Court's decision was based on the principle that the accused should be given the opportunity to adduce their evidence and that the petitioners had not shown any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order. The Court also held that the petitioners had not shown that the official witnesses were necessary to prove their case.

The Court's decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and the Evidence Act. The accused should be given the opportunity to adduce their evidence and the petitioners should be given the opportunity to produce certified copies of relevant documents. The Court's decision also ensures that the trial is conducted in a fair and just manner.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case is based on the principles of natural justice and the Evidence Act. The accused should be given the opportunity to adduce their evidence and the petitioners should be given the opportunity to produce certified copies of relevant documents. The Court's decision ensures that the trial is conducted in a fair and just manner.
