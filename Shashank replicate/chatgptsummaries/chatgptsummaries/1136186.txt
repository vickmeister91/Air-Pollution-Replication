The Madras High Court recently passed a significant order in a case where four petitioners claimed to have a customary right to graze and pen their cattle in the Anamalai mountain range, which is a sanctuary called Indira Gandhi Wild Life Sanctuary. The Wild Life Warden had passed an order permitting grazing of the cattle without penning, but the petitioners challenged this order, claiming it violated their fundamental right. The court held that there is no provision under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, to permit permanent penning of cattle within a sanctuary, and that the petitioners' claim of a customary right was not established. The court emphasized the importance of protecting wild animals and their habitat and dismissed the writ petitions.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitat. The Anamalai mountain range is a sanctuary that is home to a variety of wild animals, including elephants, tigers, and leopards. The court recognized that allowing cattle to graze and pen within the sanctuary could have a detrimental impact on the wildlife and their habitat. The court also noted that there is no provision under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, to permit permanent penning of cattle within a sanctuary. This means that the Wild Life Warden's order permitting grazing without penning was not in line with the law.

The court also rejected the petitioners' claim of a customary right to graze and pen their cattle within the sanctuary. The petitioners had argued that they had been grazing and penning their cattle in the sanctuary for generations and that this constituted a customary right. However, the court held that the petitioners had not established this claim. The court noted that the petitioners had not produced any evidence to support their claim and that the Wild Life Warden's order permitting grazing without penning did not recognize any such customary right.

The court's order is a significant victory for wildlife conservation. It sends a strong message that the protection of wildlife and their habitat is of utmost importance and that any activity that could harm them should be prohibited. The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial piece of legislation that provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitat. The court's order reinforces the importance of this law and the need for its strict enforcement.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's order in the case of the petitioners claiming a customary right to graze and pen their cattle in the Anamalai mountain range is a significant victory for wildlife conservation. The court's decision highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitat and the need for strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws. The court's order sends a strong message that any activity that could harm wildlife should be prohibited, and that the protection of wildlife and their habitat is of utmost importance.
