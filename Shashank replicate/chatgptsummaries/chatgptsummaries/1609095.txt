The Andhra High Court recently heard three writ petitions challenging assessment orders passed under the Water (prevention and control of pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court had previously dismissed the petitions, but the Supreme Court remanded the proceedings back to the High Court to consider whether the Act could be applied to the industries in question. During the hearing, the petitioners argued that the assessing authority and the appellate authority had erred in assessing the cess and that the assessment order was cryptic and lacked due application of mind.

The court found that the authorities had not considered the plea of the assessee and had not applied their minds before recording their findings. The court set aside the assessment orders and remanded the matter to the assessing authority to assess the liability of the petitioner. The court has ordered that the petitioner's liability under Section 3(2) of the Act should be calculated by subtracting the rebate available to them under the proviso to Section 7 of the Act. The court has not given a specific mathematical direction, but has stated that an equitable arrangement should be made while the matter is remanded to the assessing authority to assess the petitioner's liability.

The court has allowed all three writ petitions and set aside the impugned assessment orders, subject to the petitioner industry depositing or paying Rs. 1,13,000/- within a month. The assessing authority has been directed to assess the petitioner's liability under Section 3 of the Act de novo in the light of this judgment and after giving a fair and reasonable opportunity to the assessee to put forth its case. No costs have been awarded.

The Water (prevention and control of pollution) Cess Act, 1977, is an important piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the levy and collection of a cess on the water consumed by industries, and the funds collected are used for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of a Central Board and State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution.
