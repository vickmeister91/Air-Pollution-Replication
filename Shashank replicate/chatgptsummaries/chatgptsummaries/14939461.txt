The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/s Jayanti Timber against the State of Haryana and others as it had become infructuous. The court noted that the closure order issued against the unit had been suspended subject to certain conditions, including obtaining a valid consent to operate permission from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner agreed to withdraw the civil suit filed against the department and further litigation with the department.

The case involved M/s Jayanti Timber, a unit located in Haryana, which had been issued a closure order by the State Pollution Control Board due to non-compliance with environmental regulations. The unit had filed a writ petition challenging the closure order, but the court noted that the order had been suspended subject to certain conditions. The conditions included obtaining a valid consent to operate permission from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board.

The court observed that the petitioner had agreed to withdraw the civil suit filed against the department and further litigation with the department. This meant that the writ petition had become infructuous and was therefore dismissed by the court.

The case highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary permissions before operating a unit. Failure to do so can result in closure orders and legal proceedings, which can be time-consuming and costly.

It is also important for companies to work with regulatory authorities and address any concerns raised by them. This can help in resolving issues and avoiding legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the dismissal of the writ petition filed by M/s Jayanti Timber serves as a reminder to companies to comply with environmental regulations and work with regulatory authorities to avoid legal proceedings.
