The Jharkhand High Court recently received a complaint from a petitioner alleging that the Pollution Control Board had issued a "No Objection Certificate" to a company to establish an industry on land adjacent to forest land, contrary to their own guidelines. The petitioner sought to quash the certificate and remove the industry from the site. 

During the hearing, the court was informed that the company had committed offenses under various forest acts and that the Pollution Control Board had kept the "Consent to Operate" in abeyance and issued a show cause notice to the company. The court found that the petitioner's grievance had been redressed and disposed of the case accordingly.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to guidelines and regulations set forth by governing bodies. In this instance, the Pollution Control Board had issued a certificate that was in violation of their own guidelines, which ultimately led to legal action being taken against the company. 

Furthermore, the case also sheds light on the need for companies to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. The company in question had committed offenses under various forest acts, which not only had legal consequences but also had negative impacts on the environment. 

It is important for companies to prioritize environmental sustainability and take necessary measures to minimize their impact on the environment. This includes obtaining necessary permits and adhering to guidelines set forth by governing bodies. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against the company, as seen in this case. 

Overall, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to dispose of the case highlights the importance of adhering to guidelines and regulations, as well as the need for companies to prioritize environmental sustainability. It serves as a reminder that legal action can be taken against those who fail to do so.
