The Telangana High Court issued a common order on January 21, 2019, regarding several cases related to alleged offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The cases involve Mr. Bibhu Prasad Acharya, an IAS officer, who is a defendant in two cases related to alleged offenses under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The court order discusses the details of the cases and the petitions to quash the proceedings against Mr. Acharya. The order also includes a list of cases referred to during the proceedings.

The court order discusses multiple petitions seeking to quash proceedings against various accused, including an IAS officer, related to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The alleged offenses are related to the allotment of land for a SEZ. The order includes statements made by Acharya regarding his role and the procedures followed for allotment of land.

The court order discusses the role of B.P. Acharya, the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of M/s APIIC Limited, in the allotment of land to Aurobindo Group Companies and Hetero Group companies. It states that Acharya abused his official position and showed undue favors to these companies by violating existing norms and procedures, causing wrongful loss to M/s APIIC Limited. The court found Acharya guilty of these charges.

The court order states that Shri B.P Acharya is guilty of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 for assisting companies in creating proceeds of crime worth Rs. 21.50 Crore and causing loss to APIIC Limited. The court also mentions that there is no sanction obtained from the government to prosecute him and that the protection U/Sec. 197 Cr.P.C is applicable as he is a public servant. However, the counter filed by the investigating officer argues that all provisions of Cr.P.C. are not applicable to the proceedings initiated by Enforcement Directorate under PML Act and that there are no grounds to quash the proceedings on the alleged ground of want of sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C.

The court order states that no sanction is required to prosecute the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PML Act) and that the quash petition is incorrect and unsustainable. The case involves a private complaint against 17 accused, including YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, for alleged offenses under Section 3 of the PML Act. The role of BP Acharya, the former Vice Chairman and Managing Director of APIIC, is mentioned in the complaint as having shown undue favors to Indu Group Companies in the allotment of land for an SEZ project, causing wrongful loss to APIIC and the government.

The court order accuses Shri B.P Acharya of violating norms and facilitating money laundering in the allocation and transfer of land for a project. The order argues that there is no need for a sanction order to prosecute the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and that the PMLA is a complete code providing its own procedure. The order also cites previous judgments to support its argument.

The court order discusses the refusal of the State to process sanctions under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which conflicts with Section 48 of the 1974 Act. The writ petitioner, Adityanath Das, seeks to quash proceedings against him as one of the accused in SC No. 2 of 2017 under the PML Act. The court refers to his statement regarding the allocation of water from Krishna and Kagna rivers to M/s. India Cements during his tenure as Secretary I & CAD.

The court order states that Adityanath Das, the former Secretary of Irrigation and Command Area Development in Andhra Pradesh, abused his official position and showed undue favors to M/s. India Cements by allotting an additional 10 Lakh Litres of water from River Kagna without referring the matter to Interstate Water Resources Authority, violating existing norms and causing wrongful loss to the government. He is guilty of the offense of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 punishable under Section 4 of PMLA, 2002. The court also discusses the definition of proceeds of crime, scheduled offenses, and the burden of proof on the accused. The order also mentions that companies can be held liable for contraventions of the provisions of the PMLA 2002.

The court order discusses a case of alleged money laundering under the PMLA, 2002. The accused, who is a government official, is accused of facilitating the allocation of additional water to a company without following due procedure. The accused has filed a quash petition, arguing that the allegations are baseless and that he followed proper procedure. He also argues that no criminality can be attributed to him and that there is no intention or knowledge on his part to commit any offense of money laundering. The court is considering the arguments made by both sides.

The court order discusses the allocation of water to companies and the requirement for sanction to prosecute public servants under the PML Act. The court references various government policies and rules regarding water allocation and concludes that there was no violation. The court also addresses the issue of money laundering and the need for sanction to prosecute the petitioners. The court determines that no prior sanction is required for prosecution under the PML Act, even for public servants.
