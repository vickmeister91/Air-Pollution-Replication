The National Green Tribunal in Chennai heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appeals were filed after the Board issued orders on July 29, 2013, to shut down the companies due to pollution concerns. The case was heard by Hon'ble Justice Shri M. Chockalingam and Hon'ble Prof. Dr. R. Nagendran.

The court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The appellants argue that their units do not cause air or water pollution and have not violated any environmental laws. They also claim that they were not given an opportunity to be heard before the closure orders were issued. The respondent/Board argues that the closure orders were issued in accordance with the law and that the appellants did not obtain necessary consents to establish or operate their units. The court will consider the arguments put forth by both parties before making a decision.

The court order states that the appellants in Appeal Nos. 98-101 of 2013 (SZ) obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts and that can be termed as illegally obtained. The Government of Karnataka issued a Notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities in the said zones. The Board has also prepared a map wherein Zone 3 specified the distance factor as 1 km from the river bank and the industries of all the appellants have been established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank and many of them even without obtaining consent for establishment. The court order also mentions that the appellants were carrying on with the industries without consent either to establish or operate and some of them were carrying on by obtaining consent from misrepresentation and the period covered by the consent in their cases was also over. The court order concludes that all the appellants were carrying on their units illegally, since they were operating the units without the consent of the Board.

The court order pertains to the closure of industries under challenge, which were issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The order was issued in violation of FEE 215 ENV 2000 dated 18.11.2003 and a government order dated 12.01.2004, which were issued to protect the TGR catchment area. The government of Karnataka had issued a notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones specifying the nature of activities in each zone. The court dismissed all the appeals and directed the appellants to remove all machinery and materials within a period of 3 months.

In summary, the National Green Tribunal in Chennai heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.
