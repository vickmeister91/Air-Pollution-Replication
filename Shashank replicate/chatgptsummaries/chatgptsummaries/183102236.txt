The court allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and directed the release of the applicants on bail on their furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 35,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.
