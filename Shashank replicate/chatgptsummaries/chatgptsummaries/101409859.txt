The first court case involves a dispute between Surjeet Kaur and Sohan Lal and Vimla Devi over a property located behind Kaur's property. Kaur alleged that the defendants had encroached on a vacant piece of land and constructed two additional rooms without her consent. She also claimed that the defendants had closed a passage that connected her property to the main street. The defendants denied the allegations.

During the trial, the court found that the prayer for permanent injunction was infructuous as the construction was already completed. However, the prayer for mandatory injunction with respect to the removal of unauthorized construction was left to be considered. The court relied on a report from the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to support Kaur's claim that the disputed site existed as a gali.

After considering the evidence presented, the court dismissed the case. The court found that the defendants had indeed constructed the additional rooms without Kaur's consent, but the prayer for permanent injunction was no longer relevant as the construction had already been completed. The only prayer left to be considered was the mandatory injunction for the removal of unauthorized construction. However, the court found that the prayer for mandatory injunction was also infructuous as the construction had already been completed, and the passage had already been closed.

The second court order involves an unauthorized construction that was demolished and sealed under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Tribunal of MCD and claimed protection under the National Capital Territory Of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Act 2017.

The plaintiff sought the removal of the unauthorized construction, but the suit was dismissed as it was not maintainable due to section 347 E barring the jurisdiction of civil court. No costs were awarded, and the file was consigned to the record room.

In summary, both court cases involve disputes over unauthorized construction. In the first case, the court found that the construction had already been completed, and the prayer for permanent injunction was no longer relevant. The prayer for mandatory injunction was also infructuous as the construction had already been completed, and the passage had already been closed. In the second case, the suit was dismissed as it was not maintainable due to section 347 E barring the jurisdiction of civil court.
