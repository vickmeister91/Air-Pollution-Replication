The case in question involves a dispute over land in Himachal Pradesh. The appellants had initiated legal proceedings for the land, but their application was withdrawn. The respondents then filed a suit for recovery of sale price, which was dismissed by the Trial Court. The respondents then filed a suit for possession, which was initially dismissed by the Trial Court but later decreed by the District Judge. The appellants appealed to the High Court, which dismissed their appeal.

The appellants argued that the subsequent suit was barred by Order 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, which states that a plaintiff cannot split a cause of action and bring separate suits in respect of different reliefs arising out of the same cause of action. However, the court found that the causes of action in the two suits were different, and therefore, the rule did not apply.

The court also rejected the appellants' argument that the finding of the Trial Court on the status of the appellants as tenants should still hold, as it had been reversed by the lower appellate court. The court order confirms that the District Judge and High Court were correct in rejecting the plea raised by the appellants regarding Order 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The court noted that the appellants are in possession of the land and ordered that a compact area of 10 bighas be left with the appellants, and the decree for possession is made executable only in respect of the remaining area of 24.9 bighas. The appellants shall be treated as Protected Tenants in respect of ten bighas of land. The Tehsildar concerned shall partition the land between the parties as directed by the court.

In summary, the court found that the causes of action in the two suits were different, and therefore, the rule of res judicata cannot be applied. The court also ordered that a compact area of 10 bighas be left with the appellants, and the decree for possession is made executable only in respect of the remaining area of 24.9 bighas. The appellants shall be treated as Protected Tenants in respect of ten bighas of land. The Tehsildar concerned shall partition the land between the parties as directed by the court.
