The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by B.S. Shrma against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C for calling certain documents from the police, which were related to an earlier investigation conducted by the C.I.D in favor of the petitioner. However, the trial court had dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner could produce certified copies or call the I.O of the case along with the case diary as a defense witness.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking the production of certain documents from the police, which were related to an earlier investigation conducted by the C.I.D in favor of the petitioner. The trial court had dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner could produce certified copies or call the I.O of the case along with the case diary as a defense witness. The petitioner had then approached the High Court, seeking relief.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition with a liberty to the petitioner to move an appropriate application at the stage of defense evidence, which the trial court is requested to deal with in accordance with the law. The court held that the trial court had not erred in dismissing the petitioner's application, as the petitioner had failed to show that the documents sought were necessary for the defense of the case.

The court further held that the trial court had correctly pointed out that the petitioner could produce certified copies or call the I.O of the case along with the case diary as a defense witness. The court noted that the trial court had not prevented the petitioner from producing any document that was necessary for the defense of the case, but had only required the petitioner to follow the proper procedure for doing so.

The court also noted that the petitioner had withdrawn the petition with liberty to file afresh during the stage of defense evidence. This meant that the petitioner could file a fresh application for the production of documents at the appropriate stage of the trial, and the trial court would be required to deal with the application in accordance with the law.
