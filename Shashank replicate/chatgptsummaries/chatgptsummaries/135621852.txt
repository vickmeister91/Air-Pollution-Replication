The Supreme Court of India has recently disposed of a civil appeal filed by Sarv Jan Kalyan Sewa Samiti against the Union of India and others. The case pertains to a proposal submitted by the fourth respondent, which was being considered by the National Green Tribunal. The Tribunal had called upon the Government of Haryana to take a final decision on the proposal, and the proceedings were still pending before the Tribunal.

The appellant had raised several objections to the proposal, which were not adequately addressed by the Tribunal. The appellant had contended that the proposal would result in the destruction of a large number of trees and would have a detrimental impact on the environment. The appellant had also argued that the proposal was in violation of various environmental laws and regulations.

The Supreme Court, while disposing of the appeal, directed the Tribunal to ensure that the objections of the appellant were duly taken note of and a reasoned order was passed on each head of the objections before the matter was disposed of. The Court emphasized that the Tribunal must consider all the objections raised by the appellant and provide a detailed response to each of them.

The Court also clarified that the finding that the area of land in question was less than 0.1 hectares shall not be treated as a conclusive or binding opinion. This means that the Tribunal cannot rely solely on this finding to dispose of the matter and must consider all the objections raised by the appellant.

The Court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of considering all objections raised by stakeholders before taking a decision on a proposal that has the potential to impact the environment. The Court's direction to the Tribunal to provide a detailed response to each objection raised by the appellant is a welcome move, as it will ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders are adequately addressed.

The Court's decision also highlights the need for strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations. The appellant had argued that the proposal was in violation of various environmental laws and regulations, and the Court's decision to direct the Tribunal to consider these objections is a clear indication that such violations cannot be overlooked.

Overall, the Supreme Court's decision in this case is a positive development for environmental protection in India. The Court's emphasis on the need to consider all objections raised by stakeholders and its direction to the Tribunal to provide a detailed response to each objection is a step in the right direction. The decision also underscores the importance of strict adherence to environmental laws and regulations, which is crucial for ensuring sustainable development in the country.
