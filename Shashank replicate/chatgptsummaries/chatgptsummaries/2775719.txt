The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The application was filed against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge Singrauli in Criminal Revision No. 40/2015. The applicant, Banarsi Prasad, had filed an application for granting Supurdginama of Tractor bearing registration No.UP 64 Q 1688 and Trolley registration No. UP 64 A 0176. However, the Chief Judicial Magistrate Singrauli dismissed the application. The revision petition filed by the applicant was also rejected by the Revisional Court.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the application and directed that the seized vehicles be delivered to the applicant on Supurdginama subject to certain conditions. The court's decision was based on the fact that the applicant had produced all the necessary documents to prove his ownership of the vehicles. The court also noted that the vehicles had been seized by the police in connection with a criminal case, but the applicant had not been named as an accused in the case.

The court further observed that the applicant had a right to possess and use his property, and the seizure of the vehicles had caused him undue hardship. The court also took into account the fact that the applicant had given an undertaking to produce the vehicles before the court whenever required.

The court, therefore, directed that the seized vehicles be delivered to the applicant on Supurdginama subject to the following conditions:

1. The applicant shall produce the vehicles before the court whenever required.

2. The applicant shall not dispose of the vehicles or create any third-party interest in them.

3. The applicant shall not use the vehicles for any illegal or unlawful purpose.

4. The applicant shall cooperate with the police in the investigation of the case.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the principle of natural justice and the right to property. The court has recognized the fact that the seizure of property can cause undue hardship to the owner, and has therefore directed that the seized vehicles be delivered to the applicant on Supurdginama subject to certain conditions. This decision is likely to have a positive impact on similar cases in the future, as it sets a precedent for the protection of the rights of property owners.
