The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by M/S. Greetings Colour Processors against an order by the Appellate Authority Tamil Nadu Pollution Control. The appeal concerned the shifting of the appellant's dyeing unit from one location to another. The appellant argued that the existing unit had achieved Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and was a member of M/s. Eastern Common Effluent Treatment Plant. The respondents argued that the appellant had not renewed their consent due to non-installation of ZLD and that the proposed site was located within 1 km of the Noyyal River, which was prohibited by government orders. The Tribunal heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses the rejection of an application by M/s. Greetings Colour Processors to shift their dyeing unit to a new location due to its proximity to River Noyyal, which is prohibited by government orders. The appellant argued that the unit is a ZLD unit and shifting it to a new location would not be considered a new industry. The court found that the order of refusal to grant consent by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the Appellate Authority cannot be sustained and set it aside. The court also noted that the shifting of an existing unit to a new location would not be considered a new industry.

The court order states that the Appellate Authority had previously ruled that shifting an existing dyeing unit to a new location does not constitute setting up a new industry. The National Green Tribunal also upheld this view in a previous case. Therefore, the court sets aside the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and allows the appellant to shift their dyeing unit to a new location under certain conditions. The court does not order any costs.
