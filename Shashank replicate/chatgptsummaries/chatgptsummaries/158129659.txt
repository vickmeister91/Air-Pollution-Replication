In a recent court case, the petitioner sought a writ, order, and direction to restrain the respondent from opening a poultry farm near a residential area. The petitioner's counsel argued that the respondent was not complying with environmental guidelines and was avoiding the interests of the villagers. The respondent's counsel, on the other hand, argued that there was no violation of any provisions and that there was no bar for opening poultry farms with less than one lakh birds.

The court examined the matter and directed the Principal Secretary of the Department of Animal Husbandry to issue appropriate directions to examine the matter in the light of the present policy, which is in existence if any permission/consent to operate poultry farm in the matter is required.

The case highlights the importance of complying with environmental guidelines and considering the interests of the local community when opening a poultry farm. The petitioner's concerns about the potential impact of the farm on the surrounding area and its residents are valid and should be taken into account.

The court's decision to direct the Principal Secretary of the Department of Animal Husbandry to examine the matter is a positive step towards ensuring that the interests of all parties are considered. It is important that any permission or consent to operate a poultry farm is granted only after a thorough examination of the potential impact on the environment and the local community.

The case also raises questions about the adequacy of existing guidelines and policies related to the operation of poultry farms. It is important that these guidelines and policies are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they are effective in protecting the environment and the interests of local communities.
