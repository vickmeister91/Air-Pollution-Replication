The court order pertains to the collection of compensatory fees from trucks transporting minerals like coal and limestone for the reclamation of un-classed forest falling within the jurisdiction of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC). The petitioner had established forest check gates for the collection of such fees, claiming that they were set up with the approval of the GHADC and were necessary for checking illegal transportation of timber and other forest produce like minerals and for realization of forest revenues. The petitioner was also granted a lease to collect compensatory fees from the trucks loaded with minerals like coal and limestone for the reclamation of un-classed forest falling within the jurisdiction of the GHADC.

The court order fixed the rate of compensatory fee to be collected at Rs. 300/- per truck, and the money receipt of the same should be issued to the concerned truck driver. The period for such collection was allotted on a trial basis for three months, and the collection of such fees should not disturb the smooth movement of other vehicles in any way. The forest check gate was set up to facilitate the collection of compensatory fees from the trucks, and the petitioner was granted the lease under the orders of the GHADC.

However, the State asserted that the matter is covered by para 9 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India, whereunder only the State Government is empowered to levy compensatory fees on transportation of forest produce particularly the minerals like coal and limestone etc. The State Government has the power to levy compensatory fees on transportation of forest produce, including minerals like coal and limestone. The State Government is also the competent authority to grant leases for extracting minerals, but is required to consult an expert body like the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) for monitoring the implementation of court orders and to suggest measures for effective implementation of the Act.

The court order recognizes that states have the authority to protect natural resources for the benefit of the general public, and must act as guardians and trustees in relation to them. The court has given directions for the protection and proper allocation of natural resources, and insists on compliance with constitutional principles. The court also established the principle that "the polluter shall pay". The court clarified that only the state government can draw a comprehensive scheme for the collection of imposts in the nature of compensatory fee. The court also noted that the law made by district councils or regional councils to the extent of being repugnant to the law made by the state legislature shall be void. The court clarified that an amendment of the Sixth Schedule can be carried out by law of the parliament, and the law amending any provision shall not be deemed to be a constitutional amendment for the purpose of Article 368.

The court order states that only one-tenth of the total members of the House are required to constitute a quorum for enacting a law. The Autonomous District Council's powers for enacting law are not the same as those available with the Parliament and State Legislatures. The source of legislative competence of the Autonomous Councils is only the Sixth Schedule which can be amended by the law enacted by the Parliament. The petitioner was not granted permission by any competent authority of the State for raising construction nor does it appear that he has raised any construction. The petitioner was only operating from the premises of a local native and using the forest check gate virtually as the toll gate for the purpose of collection. The court also discusses the legal position on the payment of compensatory fee and the element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the fee and the public authority who imposes it.

The court order discusses the concept of compensatory tax and its parameters. It states that a substantial part of the revenue generated from a cess must be spent for the purposes mentioned in Section 9, and there must be a broad correlation between the fees being realized and the services rendered. The court also discusses the difference between a tax, a fee, and a compensatory tax, and the parameters of compensatory tax. The court emphasizes that whenever a law is challenged on the ground of violation of Article 301, the Court has to examine the pith and substance of the levy and the effect and operation of the impugned law on inter-State trade and commerce as well as intra-State trade and commerce.

The court order discusses the power of the state and parliament in imposing restrictions and collecting fees for mining activities in Meghalaya. It states that the state can only collect compensatory fees for damage caused to the environment if it has a comprehensive scheme and creates a fund for reclamation. The Autonomous District Councils have no power to collect such fees. The court also directs that all mining activities must stop unless they have already been granted a license or lease deed in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions. The Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary (Forest), and Principal Chief Conservator of Forests are ordered to comply with the judgment.

In summary, the court order deals with the collection of compensatory fees from trucks transporting minerals like coal and limestone for the reclamation of un-classed forest falling within the jurisdiction of the GHADC. The court clarifies that only the state government can draw a comprehensive scheme for the collection of imposts in the nature of compensatory fee and that the Autonomous District Councils have no power to collect such fees. The court also discusses the legal position on the payment of compensatory fee and the element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the fee and the public authority who imposes it. The
