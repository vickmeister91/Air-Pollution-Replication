In a recent court order, the petitioners in a Criminal Revision case were granted interim custody of a vehicle and stock of rice that had been seized by the court in a case against them. The petitioners had filed a plea for the release of the property, which had been refused by the trial court citing a provision under the Essential Commodities Act that bars jurisdiction in certain cases. However, the Joint Collector had already stated that no proceedings were pending against the petitioners under that provision.

The court allowed the revision case and granted interim custody of the vehicle and rice to the petitioners on certain conditions. This decision was made after considering the arguments put forth by both parties and examining the relevant provisions of the law.

The case pertains to the seizure of a vehicle and stock of rice by the court in connection with a case against the petitioners. The trial court had refused to release the property citing Section 6A of the Essential Commodities Act, which bars jurisdiction in certain cases. The petitioners had argued that the provision did not apply to them as there were no proceedings pending against them under that provision.

The Joint Collector had also submitted a report stating that no proceedings were pending against the petitioners under Section 6A of the Essential Commodities Act. The petitioners had therefore filed a plea for the release of the property, which was refused by the trial court.

The petitioners then filed a Criminal Revision case before the court, challenging the order of the trial court. The court examined the relevant provisions of the law and considered the arguments put forth by both parties.

After examining the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, the court held that Section 6A did not apply to the petitioners as there were no proceedings pending against them under that provision. The court also noted that the Joint Collector had already stated that no proceedings were pending against the petitioners under Section 6A.

The court therefore allowed the revision case and granted interim custody of the vehicle and rice to the petitioners on certain conditions. The conditions included the deposit of a certain amount of money and the furnishing of a bank guarantee.

In conclusion, the court order in this Criminal Revision case granted interim custody of a vehicle and stock of rice to the petitioners, after the trial court had refused to release the property citing a provision under the Essential Commodities Act. The court examined the relevant provisions of the law and considered the arguments put forth by both parties before making its decision. The order was made on certain conditions, including the deposit of a certain amount of money and the furnishing of a bank guarantee.
