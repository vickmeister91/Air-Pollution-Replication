The court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed by the U.P. Pollution Control Board against M/S Kothari Fermentation and Biochem Ltd. and its directors for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioners have challenged the prosecution and orders on various grounds, including non-compliance with statutory provisions and lack of jurisdiction. The court has heard arguments from both sides and examined the record of the case. The statutory provisions of the APCP Act have been reproduced for reference.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act aims to prevent pollution of the environment. The court order discusses the conditions that must be met for consent to be granted to operate an industrial plant in an air pollution control area, including the installation and operation of control equipment approved by the State Board. The order also outlines the procedure for taking samples of air or emissions for analysis and the consequences of non-compliance with the Act, including imprisonment and fines. The court clarifies that once consent has been refused, no industrial plant can be established or operated without specific permission from the State Board, and that the power to issue directions under Section 31A of the Act does not apply in this case.

The court order states that a person whose consent to operate an industrial plant has been refused cannot establish or operate the plant. The court also clarifies that two distinct forums are available for a person aggrieved against the order of the Board - Section 37 for punishment of a particular offence and Section 31 for civil remedy. The court rejects the challenges to the acceptability of the analyst report and the competence of the person who filed the complaint. The court also rules that the Chairman, Directors, and managers of a company can be held responsible for the company's offence of operating an industrial plant after refusal of consent. The court finds no violation of Section 202 Cr.P.C. in the case.

The court order states that the court has jurisdiction over the area where the offense was committed, and the magistrate has conducted an inquiry before taking cognizance of the matter. The petitioner's argument that the subsequent permission granted to the company makes the prosecution an abuse of process of law is not valid. The court concludes that the petition lacks merit and should be dismissed. The court also allows the personal attendance exemption of the responsible persons of the company during the trial. The trial court is directed to expedite the hearing of the case as it is petty in nature. The order was passed on July 2, 2013.
