The court order pertains to a dispute over mining activities on Randhisar Hill in District Churu, Rajasthan. The case involves multiple writ petitions filed by M/s P.G. Stone Crushing Industries, which challenged the legality of mining activities on the hill. The main issue in the case is whether the land for which mining lease was granted is a forest land or not.

The court heard all the petitions together and decided that prior permission of the Central Government is necessary for permitting mining activities in the area. The court also ordered the appointment of a committee to ascertain whether the Randhisar Hill area is a forest area or not. The court passed an interim order to stop coercive methods until the matter is resolved.

The court's decision was based on the Forest Conservation Act, which requires prior approval for non-forest activities on forest land. The State Government claims that the land in question is forest land and therefore subject to the Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the term 'forest land' includes any area recorded as forest in the government record, regardless of ownership or classification. The court also notes that a Gazette Notification declared the land in question as protected forest.

The court order declares that the land of Randhisar Hill, including Khasara No. 536/319, has been declared a protected forest and mining activities cannot be carried out without prior permission from the Central Government. The writ petitions filed by M/s P.G. Stone Crushing Industries are dismissed, and stay petitions are also dismissed.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the definition of forest land and reinforces the need for prior approval for non-forest activities on such land. The decision also highlights the importance of protecting forest areas and the need for sustainable development practices.

The appointment of a committee to ascertain whether the Randhisar Hill area is a forest area or not is a positive step towards ensuring that the land is protected and that mining activities do not harm the environment. The interim order to stop coercive methods until the matter is resolved is also a welcome move as it prevents any further damage to the land.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of mining activities on Randhisar Hill in District Churu, Rajasthan, clarifies the definition of forest land and reinforces the need for prior approval for non-forest activities on such land. The decision highlights the importance of protecting forest areas and the need for sustainable development practices. The appointment of a committee to ascertain whether the Randhisar Hill area is a forest area or not is a positive step towards ensuring that the land is protected, and the interim order to stop coercive methods until the matter is resolved is also a welcome move.
