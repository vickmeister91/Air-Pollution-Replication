The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Nirmal Das against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In subsequent hearings, the state was criticized for not complying with previous orders and failing to remove encroachments. The court ordered the state to remove all encroachments within one month and issue show cause notices to those causing pollution. The state was also directed to submit a compliance report on their progress.

The court order directed the state to comply with the directions given by the Tribunal in letter and spirit, without failure, and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal that are causing contamination of canal water. The state was also directed to issue notices to persons who are contributing to pollution and ask them to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/-, and those who resist such claims shall be directed to be present before the Tribunal. The compliance report shall be filed on the next date of hearing. The court also ordered the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT.

The court ordered that any person resisting the action of State Authorities be directed to present before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to pollution and environment protection. The court expressed its view that the NGT should be approached before seeking a writ in the nature of certiorari. The court also emphasized the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court and stated that the deviation from this principle is permissible only in extraordinary circumstances. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner(s) to approach the NGT by moving an appropriate application/representation.

The petitioner(s) requested to withdraw their writ petition and approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The State authorities were directed not to take any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. The petitioner(s) were allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by 31st December 2016. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the delay caused in approaching it as the writ petition was pending before this Court. After 31st December 2016, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The court ordered the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal.
