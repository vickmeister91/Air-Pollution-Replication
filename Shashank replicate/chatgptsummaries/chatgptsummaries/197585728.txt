The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Ramjeet Yadav and three others in connection with a case registered under the Indian Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioners had been accused of grazing their cattle inside a planted area, but their counsel argued that the allegations were false and that they had no criminal antecedents. The court ordered that the petitioners be released on bail of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount if they surrendered or were arrested within four weeks of the order.
