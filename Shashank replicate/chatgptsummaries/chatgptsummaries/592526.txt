The Delhi High Court recently passed an order in an application filed by Bharat Gupta and another person seeking to quash a charge sheet against them under sections of the Forest Conservation Act and IPC. The applicants argued that no offense was made out against them based on the material collected by the investigating officer.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the applicants to file a discharge application within 30 days, which will be heard and disposed of expeditiously. Until then, no coercive steps shall be taken against the applicants.

The case pertains to allegations of illegal felling of trees in a forest area in Haryana. The investigating officer had filed a charge sheet against the applicants, alleging that they had conspired with others to cut down trees without permission from the forest department. The charge sheet also alleged that the applicants had transported the illegally felled trees to their sawmill in Delhi.

The applicants, however, denied the allegations and argued that they had not committed any offense. They contended that the investigating officer had not collected any evidence to show that they had conspired with others to cut down trees or that they had transported the illegally felled trees to their sawmill.

The court, after perusing the material on record, observed that the investigating officer had not collected any direct evidence to show the involvement of the applicants in the alleged offense. The court also noted that the charge sheet did not disclose any specific role played by the applicants in the alleged conspiracy.

The court, therefore, directed the applicants to file a discharge application within 30 days, which will be heard and disposed of expeditiously. The court also directed that until the discharge application is disposed of, no coercive steps shall be taken against the applicants.

The order of the court is significant as it provides relief to the applicants who were facing the prospect of being arrested and prosecuted for an offense that they claim they did not commit. The order also highlights the importance of collecting direct evidence to establish the involvement of an accused in an alleged offense.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's order in the application filed by Bharat Gupta and another person to quash a charge sheet against them under sections of the Forest Conservation Act and IPC is a significant development in the case. The court's direction to file a discharge application within 30 days and the stay on coercive steps until then provides relief to the applicants. The order also emphasizes the importance of collecting direct evidence to establish the involvement of an accused in an alleged offense.
