The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving the State of Kerala Transport and L. Srinivasa Babu and others. The case concerns a road that goes through the core area of Bandipur National Park, a major tiger reserve in India. The court noted that the road is a National Highway and that 24.5 km of it goes through the core area, with 19.7 km in Karnataka and 4.8 km in Kerala. The court also mentioned that a ban on traffic between 9 pm and 6 am has been agreed upon for another road that goes through the park, but Kerala is resisting this ban for their portion of the road. The court was presented with a report suggesting that the ban be lifted, but no decision was made in the hearing.

The court order discusses various reports and recommendations regarding the ban on night traffic through Bandipur National Park. The Kerala Forest Reserve Institute suggests a partial ban during peak hours and a convoy system for the rest of the night. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways proposes a permanent solution involving the development of NH-212 with the cooperation of both state governments. However, the Ministry of Environment Forests & CC disagrees with the proposed measures and recommends maintaining the status quo of the ban on night traffic. The National Tiger Conservation Committee also recommends maintaining the ban. The court accepts the recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries to maintain the ban for the time being, but the matter is not fully resolved.

The court has accepted the expert opinions of the Tiger Conservation Authority and the Committee of Secretaries regarding the road passing through tiger conservation areas. However, the court has also acknowledged that the road should not be permitted through the core and buffer zones of these areas. The court has directed the Ministry of Environment Forests & CC to file an affidavit within four weeks with suggestions on how to make an alternative route as good as the current route passing through the tiger reserve. The court has also suggested that State Highway No. 90 be merged into NH-275 and made at least equal to NH-212, which may be closed down in the long run.
