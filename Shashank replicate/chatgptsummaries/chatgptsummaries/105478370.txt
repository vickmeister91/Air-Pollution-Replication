The Madras High Court recently dismissed two criminal original petitions filed by K.M.A. Parveen and M. Sheik Abdul Kadher to quash the summons issued by the first respondent in DCB C.No.23/DSP/SP-DR/DCB/DGL/18, C.No.G3/236/6223/18 dated 17.03.2018. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. side) appearing for the first respondent Police submitted that a case has been subsequently registered against the petitioners and others in Crime No.7 of 2018, on 24.04.2018, under Sections 120B, 420 & 506(1) of the Indian Penal Code, before the DCB Police Station, Dindigul.

The case in question pertains to allegations of fraud and criminal conspiracy. The petitioners had sought to quash the summons issued by the police in connection with the case. However, the court dismissed their petitions, citing the subsequent registration of a case against them and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of due process in criminal cases. The petitioners had sought to avoid facing the charges against them by quashing the summons issued by the police. However, the court's decision makes it clear that they will have to face the charges in court and that due process will be followed.

The case also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. The police had issued the summons to the petitioners in connection with the case, and the court's decision to dismiss their petitions indicates that the police had followed due process in doing so. This is an important reminder that the police must act within the bounds of the law and that their actions must be subject to judicial scrutiny.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for the criminal justice system in India. It reinforces the importance of due process and accountability and sends a message that those who engage in criminal activity will be held accountable for their actions.
