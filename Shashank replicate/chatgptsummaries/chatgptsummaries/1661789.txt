The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by A.V. Anbu Chezhian against P. Ambikadass for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Chezhian had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon documents such as bills, accounts, and income tax returns relating to the period 1995-2004 to be produced by the complainant. The application was dismissed by the learned Magistrate, and Chezhian had preferred a criminal revision petition.

The court observed that no presumption arises as per Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and it is only for the trial court to decide on the basis of the evidence whether there is any legally recoverable debt. The court dismissed the revision petition, stating that no useful purpose would be served by allowing the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is an act that regulates the transfer of negotiable instruments such as cheques, promissory notes, and bills of exchange. Section 138 of the Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The section provides for a criminal offence and prescribes punishment for the same.

In the present case, A.V. Anbu Chezhian had filed a petition against P. Ambikadass for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Chezhian had also filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon documents such as bills, accounts, and income tax returns relating to the period 1995-2004 to be produced by the complainant.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

However, the learned Magistrate had dismissed the application filed by Chezhian under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The reason for the dismissal was not mentioned in the court order. Chezhian had then preferred a criminal revision petition against the order of the learned Magistrate.

The court, in its order, observed that no presumption arises as per Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Section 139 of the Act provides for a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque that it was issued for the discharge of any debt or other liability. However, the court observed that it is only for the trial court to decide on the basis of the evidence whether there is any legally recoverable debt.

The court also observed that the documents sought to be summoned by Chezhian under Section 91 Cr.P.C. were not relevant for the purpose of deciding whether there is any legally recoverable debt. The court, therefore, dismissed the revision petition filed by Chezhian, stating that no useful purpose would be served by allowing the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a petition filed by A.V. Anbu Chezhian against P. Ambikadass for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Chezhian had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon documents such as bills, accounts, and income tax returns relating to the period 1995-2004 to be produced by the complainant. The application was dismissed by the learned Magistrate, and Chezhian had preferred a criminal revision petition. The court observed that no presumption arises as per Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and it is only for the trial court to decide on the basis of the evidence whether there is any legally recoverable debt. The court dismissed the revision petition, stating that no useful purpose would be served by allowing the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C.
