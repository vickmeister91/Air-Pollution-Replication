The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Mahesh Joshi under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Joshi had requested the court to quash two orders passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the Judicial Magistrate First Class in a case where he was facing prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. 

Joshi had filed applications under Section 91 and Section 311 of the Cr.PC for summoning certain documents and recalling the complainant. However, these applications were dismissed by the Trial Court, and the criminal revision filed by Joshi also failed. 

The court found that the applications were moved just to cause delay in the proceedings of the trial and dismissed the petition. This decision was based on the fact that Joshi had not provided any valid reason for the delay caused by his applications. 

The court also noted that the trial had already been delayed due to Joshi's failure to appear before the court on multiple occasions. The court found that Joshi's actions were causing unnecessary delays in the trial and were not in the interest of justice. 

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the principle that the court should not allow the abuse of its process. The court held that the applications filed by Joshi were frivolous and were intended to delay the proceedings of the trial. 

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of expeditious disposal of cases. The court's decision to dismiss the petition sends a strong message to litigants that they cannot abuse the court's process to delay the proceedings of a trial. 

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Mahesh Joshi's petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code highlights the importance of expeditious disposal of cases. The court found that Joshi's applications were frivolous and were intended to delay the proceedings of the trial. The court's decision sends a strong message to litigants that they cannot abuse the court's process to delay the proceedings of a trial.
