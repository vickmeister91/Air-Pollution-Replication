The court order in question pertains to a case where a company named Bharat Zink is seeking the renewal of its import license for zinc ash/skimmings, which are used as raw material for manufacturing pure zinc metal. The import of hazardous waste is governed by the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1990, and the Central Government had notified the Export and Import Policy for the period 1992-97, which did not have any specific entry pertaining to hazardous wastes in the Negative list of imports. However, in the amended policy notified by the Central Government with effect from 1st April 1995, the import of hazardous wastes was permitted against a license and only for the purposes of processing or re-use.

The petitioner had applied for an import license in 1994, which was granted in 1995 and was valid for one year. The petitioner had applied for renewal of the license, but the respondents had not disposed of the application for over two years.
