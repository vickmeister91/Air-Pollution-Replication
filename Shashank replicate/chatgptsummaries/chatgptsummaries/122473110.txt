The case revolves around the prosecution of Umesh Gopichand Goel for an offence punishable under Section 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Goel had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, seeking the production of certain documents that were in the custody and possession of the CBI. The learned Special Judge had partly allowed the application, and Goel had challenged the order.

The court, however, rejected the application, stating that Goel would have to lay a foundation by effective cross-examination of the witnesses in the course of the trial. This means that Goel will have to prove the relevance and admissibility of the documents he seeks to produce through the testimony of witnesses during the trial.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the production of documents must be relevant and necessary for the just decision of the case. The court has the power to order the production of documents, but this power must be exercised judiciously and only when it is necessary for the just decision of the case.

In this case, the court found that Goel had not established the relevance and admissibility of the documents he sought to produce. The court also noted that the documents were in the custody and possession of the CBI, and Goel had not made any effort to obtain them through other means, such as a subpoena or a request for production.

The court's decision highlights the importance of effective cross-examination in establishing the relevance and admissibility of documents in a trial. It also underscores the need for parties to make a diligent effort to obtain documents through other means before seeking a court order for their production.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that the production of documents must be relevant and necessary for the just decision of the case, and that parties must make a diligent effort to obtain documents through other means before seeking a court order for their production.
