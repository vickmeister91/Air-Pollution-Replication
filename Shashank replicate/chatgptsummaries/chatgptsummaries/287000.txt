The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Arun Kumar, had applied for promotion to the post of Lecturer (Physics) but was rejected by the District Inspector of Schools, Bijnor, on the grounds of not possessing the requisite teaching experience. The court upheld the decision of the District Inspector of Schools, stating that the petitioner was ineligible for promotion as he did not have the required five years of teaching experience as an L.T. grade teacher on the first day of the year of recruitment, as per Rule-14 of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules, 1998.

The petitioner had argued that he had gained the necessary experience through his appointment in various institutions, but the court found that these appointments were illegal and did not satisfy the statutory provisions. Therefore, the experience gained from such appointments could not be taken into consideration for promotion.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Rule-14 of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules, 1998, which states that a candidate must have five years of teaching experience as an L.T. grade teacher on the first day of the year of recruitment to be eligible for promotion to the post of Lecturer (Physics). The court found that the petitioner did not meet this requirement and therefore, his application for promotion was rightly rejected by the District Inspector of Schools.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following statutory provisions and rules while making appointments and promotions in the education sector. It also emphasizes the need for candidates to meet the eligibility criteria set out in the rules and regulations governing such appointments and promotions.

The writ petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the court, which means that the decision of the District Inspector of Schools stands and the petitioner will not be promoted to the post of Lecturer (Physics) at this time. The court's decision serves as a reminder to all candidates seeking promotions in the education sector to ensure that they meet the eligibility criteria set out in the relevant rules and regulations.
