In a recent court order, the issue at hand was the renewal of mining leases for major minerals by nine petitioners. The petitioners had applied for renewal of their mining leases but were unable to transport the excavated minerals due to the lack of an Environmental Clearance Certificate from the Department of Pollution Control Board. The Pollution Control Board and the State argued that mining operations without the necessary clearance and consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board were not permissible under the law. 

The court ruled that the petitioners must obtain the necessary environmental clearance certificate and NOC with consent to operate mining lease from the Pollution Control Board before they can lawfully operate the mines. This ruling is in line with the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which requires mining operations to obtain necessary clearances and consents from the Pollution Control Board before commencing operations. 

The court order allows the petitioners to approach competent authorities for the necessary Environmental Clearance Certificate and NOC required by law for the mining lease in question. The competent authority may consider the application for environmental clearance certificate in accordance with the law within a reasonable time. However, the writ petition is dismissed for the given reasons. 

The court's ruling is significant as it upholds the importance of obtaining necessary clearances and consents before commencing mining operations. This is crucial for ensuring that mining activities do not harm the environment and the health of the people living in the vicinity of the mines. The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations to prevent environmental degradation and protect the rights of the people. 

The court's order also emphasizes the importance of timely decision-making by competent authorities in granting environmental clearances and NOCs. Delay in granting clearances and consents can lead to unnecessary delays in mining operations, which can have adverse economic consequences for the mining industry and the country as a whole. Therefore, it is essential that competent authorities act promptly and efficiently in processing applications for environmental clearances and NOCs. 

In conclusion, the court's ruling in this case is a significant step towards ensuring that mining operations are conducted in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible manner. The court's decision to require the petitioners to obtain necessary clearances and consents before commencing mining operations is a positive development that will help protect the environment and the rights of the people. The court's order also highlights the need for timely decision-making by competent authorities in granting environmental clearances and NOCs, which is crucial for promoting economic growth and development in the mining sector.
