The Madras High Court recently heard a writ appeal by ICICI Bank against a previous order to pay pension to a retired employee of Bank of Madura Limited. The court considered whether a writ petition is maintainable against a private bank and whether the employee was eligible for pension under the Bank of Madura Employees' Pension Regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous Supreme Court decisions on the matter. Ultimately, the court allowed the appeal and overturned the previous order to pay pension to the retired employee.

The case revolved around the eligibility of a retired employee of Bank of Madura Limited to receive pension under the Bank of Madura Employees' Pension Regulations. The employee had filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a direction to ICICI Bank to pay him pension. The writ petition was allowed by the single judge of the Madras High Court, and ICICI Bank was directed to pay pension to the retired employee.

ICICI Bank filed a writ appeal against the order of the single judge, arguing that a writ petition is not maintainable against a private bank and that the retired employee was not eligible for pension under the Pension Regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous Supreme Court decisions on the matter.

The Supreme Court has held that a writ petition may be maintainable against a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature. However, the court also stated that a private company carrying on banking business cannot be termed as an institution or a company carrying on any statutory or public duty. In the present case, ICICI Bank argued that it is a private bank and does not discharge any public duty or positive obligation of public nature. The court agreed with ICICI Bank and held that a writ petition is not maintainable against a private bank.

The court also considered the eligibility of the retired employee to claim pension under the Pension Regulations. The Pension Regulations provide for the payment of pension to employees who have completed a certain number of years of service. The court examined the service record of the retired employee and found that he had not completed the required number of years of service to be eligible for pension. The court, therefore, held that the retired employee was not eligible for pension under the Pension Regulations.

In light of the above, the court allowed the appeal filed by ICICI Bank and set aside the order of the single judge directing ICICI Bank to pay pension to the retired employee. The court held that a writ petition is not maintainable against a private bank and that the retired employee was not eligible for pension under the Pension Regulations.

This case highlights the importance of understanding the eligibility criteria for claiming pension under the relevant regulations. It also clarifies that a writ petition may not be maintainable against a private bank unless it is discharging a public duty or positive obligation of public nature.
