The court order pertains to three separate cases related to land disputes in Kerala. The first case involves a petitioner named K.C. Dhellapan Nair who challenged an order passed by the Taluk Land Board and filed a revision petition. The court granted an interim stay of dis-possession of the petitioner from a certain extent of property. Later, the board passed an order exempting an extent of land under the misapprehension that the court had finally disposed of the case. The petitioner filed a statement under the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, showing his family members and the land held by him. The board passed a final order directing the petitioner to surrender an extent of land. The petitioner challenged the order, and the court granted him an opportunity to exercise his option. The court vacated an earlier order passed by the board and directed it to re-consider the case after the disposal of appeals pending before the civil court. The board rejected the petitioner's contention that an extent of land covered by a gift deed should be excluded from the ceiling limit. The court held that the gift deed was not executed during the period mentioned in the Act and that the board was justified in rejecting the petitioner's contention. The petitioner's counsel submitted that the extent covered by the gift deed could still be excluded from the purview of the ceiling case in view of the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 2005.

The second case discussed in the court order pertains to the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, specifically the amendment made in 2006 which introduced Section 7E and sub-section (4) of Section 84. Section 7E provides protection to persons who acquired land not exceeding four hectares in extent by way of purchase or otherwise on payment of consideration from any person holding land in excess of the ceiling area, between the date of commencement of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 and the date of commencement of Amendment Act, 2005. The court clarifies that a gift deed does not come under the purview of Section 7E as it requires payment of consideration. The court also states that the person entitled to the benefit of Section 7E must be a stranger and not a member of the statutory family which holds lands in excess of the ceiling area. The court concludes by stating that a member of the statutory family who purchased land from another member of the statutory family is not entitled to claim the benefit of Section 7E.

The third case discussed in the court order pertains to a land acquisition case where strangers had claimed 3 acres and 47.25 cents of land. The court has directed the Taluk Land Board to consider whether this extent of land can be excluded from the ceiling case. The Board has been asked to issue notices to all claimants who had filed claim petitions earlier and dispose of the case expeditiously after hearing all concerned parties. The court has also set aside an order passed by the Taluk Land Board on 19-12-2000, which had exempted an extent of 4.52 acres from the ceiling area.
