The case in question involves two appeals that arose from proceedings under Section 144, Civil P.C. in the Court of the Assistant Collector, First Class, District Ballia. The appellant had obtained two decrees for ejectment from the rent Court against the opposite parties and was put in possession of the properties. However, the opposite parties appealed and applied for restoration of their possession and for mesne profits for the period of their dispossession. The Assistant Collector awarded the mesne profits against the plaintiff-appellant, but the opposite parties appealed to the District Judge who decreed a larger amount.

The first point that was urged in the appeals was that no appeal lay to the District Judge from the order of the Assistant Collector allowing restitution. The court held that the appeal to the District Judge was incompetent and set aside the order of the lower Appellate Court and restored the decision of the Assistant Collector.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal procedures and the jurisdiction of the courts. In this case, the opposite parties had appealed to the wrong court, which resulted in a delay in the resolution of the matter. It is essential for litigants to seek legal advice and understand the legal procedures to avoid such delays and complications.

The case also raises the issue of mesne profits. Mesne profits refer to the profits that a person in wrongful possession of a property is liable to pay to the rightful owner. In this case, the opposite parties were liable to pay mesne profits for the period of their dispossession. The court awarded mesne profits against the plaintiff-appellant, which was later increased by the District Judge. The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal principles and the factors that are considered while awarding mesne profits.

The case also highlights the importance of evidence in legal proceedings. The court relied on the evidence presented by the parties to determine the amount of mesne profits. The evidence presented by the opposite parties was found to be more convincing, which resulted in the increase in the amount of mesne profits awarded by the District Judge. It is essential for litigants to present strong and convincing evidence to support their claims in legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the case involves two appeals arising from proceedings under Section 144, Civil P.C. in the Court of the Assistant Collector, First Class, District Ballia. The court held that the appeal to the District Judge was incompetent and set aside the order of the lower Appellate Court and restored the decision of the Assistant Collector. The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal procedures, the jurisdiction of the courts, and the legal principles while seeking legal remedies. It also emphasizes the importance of evidence in legal proceedings and the need for litigants to present strong and convincing evidence to support their claims.
