The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to issues of pollution and contamination of canals in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, India. The first order concerns a writ petition filed by Chiman Lal regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through the district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court also noted that one of the related cases concerning the main Ganga Nahar Canal had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The second court order concerns the pollution and contamination of the Ganga Nahar Canal and its distributories. The State was directed to come up with short and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The compliance report revealed that water samples from the distributories could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The State came up with a long-term plan to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments, which would take six months and one and a half years, respectively. The court directed the State to place before them the steps taken for construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. The court also directed the State/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the dispatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009 to them before the next date of hearing. The case was listed on 10th July 2015.

The third court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The compliance report filed by the state reveals that out of 1237 encroachments, 637 encroachers approached the High Court, and steps are being taken for the removal of the remaining encroachments. However, the court finds that there has been no effective action against the remaining encroachers and orders the removal of all encroachments within one month. The state is directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures contributing to contamination of canal water. The court warns that failure to comply with the directions will result in appropriate action.

The fourth court order orders the state to comply with directions to remove structures causing contamination of canal water and file a compliance report. The Chief Engineer's affidavit revealed that the government's actions fell short of what was required, and the District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the state's actions should approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has jurisdiction over civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The fifth court order discusses the circumstances under which a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued, even if an appeal or revision is available. The court has the power to issue a writ if an inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or if there is a violation of natural justice. However, the court may still insist on the use of alternative remedies if they are efficacious. The order also discusses the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Act of 2010 and the principles of sustainable development, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to approach the NGT with appropriate application/representation. The NGT is expected to consider the delay caused by the writ petition and may condone it sympathetically.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of addressing issues of pollution and contamination in canals and waterways in a timely and effective manner. The courts have directed the state to take action to remove encroachments and structures contributing to contamination, and to impose damages or compensation on those found to be polluting the waterways. The courts have also emphasized the importance of following established legal procedures and exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court. The National Green Tribunal has been identified as a key forum for addressing environmental issues and ensuring sustainable development.
