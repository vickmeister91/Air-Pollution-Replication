On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, listing multiple cases (CWP Nos.) with their respective petitioners and respondents. The cases involved individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The court order pertained to several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land in Himachal Pradesh. While the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land.

The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court noted that some of the encroachers were proprietors of the village and had sufficient land holdings under their ownership, while others were landless and homeless and had constructed small structures on government land.

The court refrained from expressing views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the state government was directed to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and a meeting of all principal secretaries of such departments was directed to be convened. The final decision must keep in view public interest and cannot give preference to individual hardship. The policy decision would be subject to judicial review, and till then, status quo shall be maintained.

The court order pertained to encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court noted that the issue was complex and required a nuanced approach. The court recognized that the encroachers were not a homogenous group and that their circumstances varied widely. The court also recognized that the issue had wider implications for the state and the country as a whole.

The court order recognized that the issue of encroachment on government land was not new and had been a matter of concern for many years. The court noted that the state had taken various measures to address the issue, including the enactment of laws and the creation of administrative bodies to deal with the issue. However, the court noted that these measures had not been effective in addressing the issue.

The court order recognized that the issue of encroachment on government land was a complex one and required a multi-pronged approach. The court noted that the issue could not be addressed by a single department or agency and required the involvement of various stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and the affected communities.

The court order recognized that the issue of encroachment on government land was not just a legal issue but also a social and economic one. The court noted that the encroachers were often poor and marginalized and had limited options for livelihood. The court recognized that the issue required a holistic approach that took into account the social and economic realities of the affected communities.

The court order recognized that the issue of encroachment on government land was not just a local issue but also a national one. The court noted that the issue had wider implications for the country as a whole, including issues of land use, urbanization, and development. The court recognized that the issue required a national-level policy response that took into account the diverse needs and interests of the various stakeholders.

In conclusion, the court order recognized that the issue of encroachment on government land was a complex one that required a nuanced and multi-pronged approach. The court recognized that the issue had wider implications for the state and the country as a whole and required a national-level policy response. The court directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months, keeping in view public interest and individual hardship. The policy decision would be subject to judicial review, and till then, status quo shall be maintained.
