The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Harvinder Singh against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In a subsequent court order, the State was directed to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination in canals and distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The court directed the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the State to enforce this rule. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case. The State was directed to submit a comprehensive plan and report on the action taken. The court warned that a fine of Rs. 50,000 would be imposed if the State failed to comply. The District Collector was directed to be present on the next hearing date. The State was also directed to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through the municipal areas.

In another court order, the court considered the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas. A committee was constituted to demarcate the encroachments and monitor the removal of the same. The court directed the removal of all encroachments within one month and ordered the District Collector, Sriganganagar, Superintendent of Police, Sriganganagar, Commissioner, Municipal Council, Sriganganagar, and the Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to persons causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report was to be filed by 29th January, 2016. The court observed that the State had not complied with the directions in letter and spirit and warned of appropriate action if not complied with.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court has also directed the authorities to take action against encroachers and recover compensation from them. The court has suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environment protection. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if the inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

In the final court order, the court states that even if an appeal or revision is available, a writ court can be approached if an inferior court or tribunal has committed an error that cannot be cured by other remedies. However, if the inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, the doctrine of alternative remedy may be ignored. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the issue was within the jurisdiction of the tribunal and the petitioner could avail the remedy provided under the Act of 2010. The writ petition was dismissed with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016.

Overall, the court orders pertain to the pollution and encroachment of water bodies in Rajasthan, particularly in the Sri Ganganagar district. The court has directed the State to take effective measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and to remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board has been directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water. The court has also imposed fines on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the State to enforce this rule. The court has warned of appropriate action if the State fails to comply
