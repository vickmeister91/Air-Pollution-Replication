The National Green Tribunal recently issued an order in the case of Latif Beg & Ors. Vs. MoEF & Ors. regarding the operation of a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) plant in Bareilly. The plant was found to be operating without proper authorization and consent, and various deficiencies were noted in a joint inspection report. The Respondent No. 4, the waste management plant, was directed not to operate the plant until it obtained Environmental Clearance and fresh authorization as per Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000. 

The court also directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to inspect the premises and submit a report on the treatment and disposal of leachates. The Respondent No. 4 argued that their MSW plant was one of the best in India and should be permitted to operate, but the court ruled that financial gain cannot be at the cost of public welfare. The court cited previous cases and rules that units operating without authorization or in violation of conditions must be closed. 

The respondent has not obtained the necessary consent and authorization from the State Pollution Control Board and has not received approval from the Central Pollution Control Board on the technology used. Reports show that the plant is causing pollution and hazardous waste is affecting neighboring residents and groundwater. Therefore, the court orders the closure of the waste management plant until all deficiencies are cured and proper authorization is obtained. 

The court order emphasizes the importance of compliance with mandatory requirements under the law. The respondent cannot continue to operate without proper authorization and compliance with these requirements. The court also highlights the principle that financial gain cannot come at the cost of public welfare. The closure of the waste management plant is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the neighboring residents and the environment. 

This order is significant as it sets a precedent for the closure of units operating without proper authorization or in violation of conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of compliance with environmental regulations and the need to prioritize public welfare over financial gain. The order also highlights the role of the CPCB in monitoring and enforcing compliance with environmental regulations. 

In conclusion, the National Green Tribunal's order in the case of Latif Beg & Ors. Vs. MoEF & Ors. regarding the operation of a Municipal Solid Waste plant in Bareilly is a significant step towards ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and protecting public welfare. The order emphasizes the importance of compliance with mandatory requirements under the law and sets a precedent for the closure of units operating without proper authorization or in violation of conditions. It also highlights the role of the CPCB in monitoring and enforcing compliance with environmental regulations.
