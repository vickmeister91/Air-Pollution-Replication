The case at hand involves a dispute between the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and the Secretary of the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Jharkhand. The petitioner in this case is seeking to quash a letter and notification issued by the Secretary, which stayed the operation of a decision taken by the Board to enhance the age of superannuation of its officers and employees from 58 years to 60 years. The petitioner argues that the decision was taken in accordance with the rules and regulations and that the State Government has no power to interfere with the decision of the Board. The State Government, on the other hand, argues that the decision of the Board cannot be made applicable without its approval as required under Section 12(4) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court is tasked with determining whether the decision taken by the Board is a regulation within the meaning of Section 12(4) of the Act. The court notes that the question of whether the state government has jurisdiction to interfere with the Board's resolution is the only relevant issue in the case. The court ultimately allows the writ petition and quashes the impugned orders, but does not award costs.

The court order states that a resolution by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board cannot be considered a regulation and therefore does not require approval from the state government. The court notes that the Board is a statutory body created under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is empowered to take decisions in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The court further notes that the Act does not require the Board to seek approval from the state government for its decisions.

The court also observes that the impugned orders issued by the Secretary of the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Jharkhand, are not supported by any legal provision. The court notes that the Secretary has not cited any provision of law that empowers him to stay the operation of the Board's decision. The court further notes that the Secretary has not given any reasons for staying the operation of the Board's decision.

The court concludes that the impugned orders are arbitrary and without any legal basis. The court notes that the State Government has not been able to show that it has any power to interfere with the decision of the Board. The court observes that the Board is an independent body and its decisions cannot be interfered with by the State Government. The court, therefore, allows the writ petition and quashes the impugned orders.

In conclusion, the court has held that a resolution by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board cannot be considered a regulation and therefore does not require approval from the state government. The court has also held that the State Government has no power to interfere with the decision of the Board. The court has quashed the impugned orders issued by the Secretary of the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Jharkhand, as they are arbitrary and without any legal basis. The court has not awarded costs in this case.
