The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab recently heard a complaint filed by Kulvinder Singh against The Sherwood Officers Society and others for failing to hand over possession of a residential plot within the stipulated time. The complainant sought a refund of Rs. 31,08,500/- along with interest, compensation for mental harassment, litigation expenses, and counsel fee. The opposite parties denied the allegations and claimed that the complainant did not make payments as per the schedule given along with the allotment letter. The Commission allowed both parties to lead their respective evidence.

The court order discusses a complaint filed against a housing project called Sherwood Estates in Mohali. The complainant had booked a plot and made payments, but possession was not given within the promised time frame. The project was later handed over to another party, and the complainant was issued a revised allotment letter with a new possession date, which was also not met. The court dismissed an application by the defendants to dismiss the complaint based on jurisdiction, stating that the Consumer Protection Act applies to cases where a cooperative society has assured services to its members and failed to deliver. The court also noted a violation of the PAPRA Act by the defendants.

The court order states that no promoter can issue an advertisement or prospectus for selling apartments or plots without holding a certificate of registration and filing a copy of the advertisement or prospectus in the office of the competent authority. The advertisement or prospectus must disclose the area of the apartments or plots, title to the land, extent and situation of land, the price payable, and other prescribed matters. If any person sustains any loss or damage due to any untrue statement included in the advertisement or prospectus, the promoter, every partner of the firm, or every person who is a director at the time of issue of the advertisement or prospectus shall be liable to compensate. The court also ordered the opposite parties to refund the sum of Rs. 31,08,500/- along with interest, pay compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for unfair trade practice, and pay Rs. 21,000/- as litigation costs.
