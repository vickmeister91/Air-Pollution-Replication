The court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner, who is the fourth accused in a case related to hunting and sharing the meat of a wild bear. The court has taken into consideration the statement of the first accused, which does not implicate the petitioner as being present during the hunting. Based on this, the court has granted bail to the petitioner on certain conditions.

The conditions of the bail include a bond of Rs. 10,000 and regular reporting to the investigating officer. The petitioner is also not allowed to influence or intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence. If any of these conditions are breached, the bail will be cancelled.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner is based on the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the petitioner was involved in the hunting of the wild bear. The statement of the first accused, who is the main witness in the case, does not implicate the petitioner as being present during the hunting. This lack of evidence is a key factor in the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner.

The conditions of the bail are designed to ensure that the petitioner does not interfere with the investigation or tamper with evidence. The bond of Rs. 10,000 is a financial guarantee that the petitioner will comply with the conditions of the bail. The requirement to report regularly to the investigating officer is also designed to ensure that the petitioner remains in contact with the authorities and does not abscond.

The prohibition on influencing or intimidating witnesses is a standard condition of bail. This condition is designed to ensure that witnesses are not intimidated or coerced into changing their testimony. The prohibition on tampering with evidence is also a standard condition of bail. This condition is designed to ensure that evidence is not destroyed or altered in any way.

If any of these conditions are breached, the bail will be cancelled. This means that the petitioner will be taken into custody and will remain in custody until the trial is completed. The cancellation of bail is a serious matter and is designed to ensure that the petitioner complies with the conditions of the bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner, who is the fourth accused in a case related to hunting and sharing the meat of a wild bear. The court has taken into consideration the statement of the first accused, which does not implicate the petitioner as being present during the hunting. The court has granted bail on certain conditions, including a bond of Rs. 10,000 and regular reporting to the investigating officer. The petitioner is not to influence or intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence. If any of these conditions are breached, the bail will be cancelled.
