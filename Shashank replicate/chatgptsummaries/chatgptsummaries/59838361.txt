The Delhi High Court recently received petitions challenging an advertisement issued by the GNCTD for the appointment of members of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The advertisement reserved one post for a female non-judicial member and the other for a judicial member. The petitioners argued that the advertisement violated Section 16 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which sets out the qualifications and composition of the State Commission. The court examined the provisions of Section 16 and heard arguments from both parties.

The court order discusses the appointment and terms of service of members of the State Commission, including their salaries, qualifications, and length of term. The order also addresses the reservation of posts for female and judicial members, with the petitioner arguing that the reservation for a judicial member is contrary to Section 16 of the Act. The court considers various legal interpretations and precedents before making a decision.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 16(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, which requires at least one female member on the State Commission. The court finds that the advertisement for a female non-judicial member is contrary to the Act, as it does not reserve posts for women or those with a judicial background. The court also notes that the Consumer Courts are judicial organizations and require members with adequate knowledge and experience, including those without a judicial background. The court cites previous cases to emphasize the importance of having a judicial member on tribunals for effective adjudication of legal matters.

The court order discusses the importance of having a sufficient number of judges with a legal background in various tribunals and appellate authorities, including environmental and consumer courts. The court cites previous cases and emphasizes the need for adequate judicial and scientific inputs in these bodies to ensure proper and fair adjudication of disputes. The court also notes that legal input is important in consumer courts, as they deal with complex laws and legal issues. The order suggests that at least one person with a judicial background should be present in the Consumer Courts, unless presided by the President himself. The order concludes that if the government decides to appoint a person with a judicial background for the State Commission, the petitioners cannot have any grievance.

The court order states that the government can appoint a person with a judicial background to facilitate the creation of a bench of the State Commission, and if they advertise the post for such a person, there can be no grievance. The State Government is entitled to fill the vacancy of a Member from amongst the persons having judicial background if that is the need of the hour. The President of the State Commission is not considered a "member" for the purpose of Section 16(1)(b) of the Act. The State Commission must consist of at least three persons, including the President and two other members. The advertisement to fill the post of a Member (judicial) is in accord with Section 16 of the Act and is upheld.

In summary, the court order addresses the issue of the appointment of members of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the reservation of posts for female and judicial members. The court examines the provisions of Section 16 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and considers various legal interpretations and precedents before making a decision. The court emphasizes the importance of having a sufficient number of judges with a legal background in various tribunals and appellate authorities, including environmental and consumer courts, to ensure proper and fair adjudication of disputes. The court concludes that if the government decides to appoint a person with a judicial background for the State Commission, the petitioners cannot have any grievance. The advertisement to fill the post of a Member (judicial) is in accord with Section 16 of the Act and is upheld.
