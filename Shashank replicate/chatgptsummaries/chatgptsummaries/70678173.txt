In a recent case, a petitioner filed an application under Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. to quash the FIR against them for allegedly using forged documents. The documents in question were alleged to be issued under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner argued that the FIR was filed with malafide intentions and that the allegations against them were baseless.

However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner can use their defense during the trial. The court held that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further stated that quashing the FIR at this stage would not be appropriate as it would amount to interfering with the investigation process.

The court also directed the Criminal Section to supply certified copies of the order to the parties upon compliance of formalities. This means that the petitioner will have access to the court's order and can use it as evidence during the trial.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of allowing the investigation process to take its course. It also emphasizes the need for parties to present their defense during the trial rather than seeking to quash the FIR at an early stage.

It is important to note that Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. However, the court's power under this section is discretionary and should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where it is necessary to prevent abuse of the process of the court.

In this case, the court found that the petitioner had not made a strong enough case to warrant the quashing of the FIR. The court held that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the petitioner can use their defense during the trial and that quashing the FIR at this stage would not be appropriate.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of allowing the investigation process to take its course and the need for parties to present their defense during the trial. It also emphasizes the discretionary nature of the court's power under Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. and the need for parties to make a strong case before seeking to quash an FIR.
