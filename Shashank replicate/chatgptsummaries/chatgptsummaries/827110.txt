The Delhi High Court recently dismissed an appeal by the Revenue against a decision by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal to delete a penalty imposed on Saraya Industries Ltd. for claiming depreciation on a biogas plant. The assessed claimed that the plant was used for its business purposes, even though it only started producing biogas in the subsequent year. The Tribunal accepted the view of the Commissioner that the assessed had not furnished inaccurate particulars and set aside the penalty. The High Court held that the expression "used for the purposes of the business" needs to be liberally interpreted and that the assessed had taken a plausible view.

The case involved a dispute over the eligibility of Saraya Industries Ltd. to claim depreciation on a biogas plant. The assessed had claimed that the plant was used for its business purposes, even though it only started producing biogas in the subsequent year. The Revenue had imposed a penalty on the assessed for claiming depreciation on the plant, which it claimed was not used for business purposes.

The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had earlier set aside the penalty imposed by the Revenue, accepting the view of the Commissioner that the assessed had not furnished inaccurate particulars. The Tribunal had held that the expression "used for the purposes of the business" needs to be liberally interpreted and that the assessed had taken a plausible view.

The Revenue had appealed against the decision of the Tribunal to the Delhi High Court. The High Court, however, dismissed the appeal, holding that the Tribunal had correctly interpreted the expression "used for the purposes of the business". The Court held that the expression needs to be liberally interpreted and that the assessed had taken a plausible view.

The Court observed that the assessed had claimed depreciation on the biogas plant on the basis that it was used for its business purposes. The fact that the plant had not started producing biogas in the relevant year did not mean that it was not used for business purposes. The Court held that the assessed had taken a plausible view and that the Tribunal had correctly set aside the penalty imposed by the Revenue.

The Court also observed that the expression "used for the purposes of the business" needs to be liberally interpreted. The Court held that the expression should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive manner, but should be given a broad and liberal interpretation. The Court held that the assessed had taken a plausible view and that the Tribunal had correctly set aside the penalty imposed by the Revenue.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court has held that the expression "used for the purposes of the business" needs to be liberally interpreted and that the assessed had taken a plausible view in claiming depreciation on a biogas plant. The Court has dismissed an appeal by the Revenue against a decision by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal to delete a penalty imposed on the assessed for claiming depreciation on the plant. The Court has held that the Tribunal had correctly interpreted the expression "used for the purposes of the business" and that the assessed had taken a plausible view.
