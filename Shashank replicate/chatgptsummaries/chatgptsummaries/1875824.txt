The Tehri Dam Project in India has been the subject of several court orders, each addressing different aspects of the project. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution regarding the safety and environmental aspects of the Tehri Dam. The petitioners sought further safety tests, compliance with environmental clearance conditions, and rehabilitation aspects. The court drew a line between policy and judicial interference and examined the history of the project, including the decision to abandon it in 1986 and its revival in 1987 with the help of the USSR. The court examined the safety aspect of the dam and concluded that it had been tested and found to be safe against earthquakes. The court also noted that the government had taken steps to ensure the safety of the dam, including the appointment of a group of experts to examine the relevant scientific and technical reports.

The second court order discusses the safety concerns surrounding the construction of the Tehri Dam in India. A group of experts concluded that the dam's design was expected to withstand earthquakes during its economic performance life. However, four experts suggested additional tests be conducted as a matter of abundant caution. The government ultimately decided not to conduct these tests and granted clearance for the project. The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the need for strict compliance with environmental protection laws. The conditions for the environmental clearance of the Tehri Dam project are also outlined.

The third court order outlines several conditions that must be met for the Tehri Dam Project to receive environmental clearance. These conditions include catchment area treatment, rehabilitation, command area development, flora and fauna studies, water quality maintenance, disaster management, and the establishment of the Bhagirathi Basin Management Authority. The order emphasizes that these conditions must be implemented pari passu with the engineering works, and failure to comply could result in the project being halted. The order also notes that there have been concerns about the project's environmental impact and that a committee was appointed to examine these issues. The order provides updates on the status of compliance with each condition, including progress made on catchment area treatment and rehabilitation.

The fourth court order discusses various aspects related to the Tehri dam project, including the implementation of the Catchment Area Treatment program, Command Area Development, preservation of flora and fauna, water quality maintenance, disaster management, and rehabilitation of those affected by the project. The court emphasizes the importance of maintaining ecological balance and protecting human rights, and stresses the need for proper rehabilitation of those displaced by the project. The court also notes the government's acceptance of certain recommendations made by the HRC and the need for strict compliance with conditions attached to the project's clearance.

The fifth court order discusses the issue of relief and rehabilitation for displaced persons after clearance is given for a project. The court rejects certain objections raised by the petitioners, such as the extent of land recommended by the HRC being inadequate and the age for classification of sons and unmarried daughters being 21 instead of 18. The court also discusses the rehabilitation program for affected families and notes that a socio-economic study revealed that the quality of life of the resettled families is better than before rehabilitation. The court also mentions various improvements made to the rehabilitation package for affected families.

The sixth court order discusses the construction of a dam in the Himalayan Valley near Tehri and the potential impact on the environment and human rights. The court orders the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to ensure compliance with the conditions on which environmental clearance was granted for the project. The order also discusses the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected families, the construction of bridges and roads, and the establishment of educational and medical facilities in rural areas. The court transfers the case to the High Court of Uttaranchal for further monitoring and compliance.

The seventh court order discusses the Tehri Dam Project and the controversy surrounding its environmental impact and safety. The Ministry of Environment and Forests initially concluded that the project did not merit environmental clearance due to its risks and hazards. However, the project was later given conditional clearance after being reassessed by the Department of Mines. The court is faced with conflicting claims from technocrats, environmentalists, and human rights activists. The order emphasizes the importance of balancing economic development with environmental and social concerns, particularly in regards to the displacement of local communities. The court ultimately concludes that the project should only proceed if all conditions for environmental clearance are fully met and the rehabilitation of displaced communities is completed to their satisfaction.

The eighth court order outlines the mandatory rehabilitation and compensation for displaced persons due to national development projects. The displaced persons should be the first beneficiaries of any project, and land for land is recommended, especially for tribals. The court emphasizes that the state government must provide alternative land or employment to those dispossessed from land due to acquisition for public purpose. The court also highlights the importance of prioritizing the less advantaged group, financially and politically weak, who are likely to lose their home and source of livelihood. The court issues several directions to the respondents representing various ministries and departments of the central and state government, including the constitution of a committee of experts and representatives of NGOs to investigate and report on the status of the work every three months. The court also orders the establishment of an effective Grievance Redressal Cell to solve rehabilitation and resettlement problems of the oustees of the project.

In summary, the court orders related to the Tehri Dam Project in India address various aspects of the project, including safety, environmental impact, rehabilitation of displaced persons
