The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s Bansal Uniforms for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable as the complainant had no authority to file it and that the notification only applied to the main market of Delhi. The complainant argued that the complaint was filed by an authorized officer in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board and with the prior approval of the Member Secretary. The court considered various judgments and relevant provisions of the law and ultimately found that the complaint was maintainable.

The court order states that no offense under the Act can be prosecuted unless a complaint is made by the Central Government, an authorized authority or officer, or a person who has given notice of the alleged offense and their intention to make a complaint. The provisions of the Act and its rules will have effect despite anything inconsistent in any other enactment, except where an act or omission constitutes an offense under both this Act and another Act, in which case the offender will be punished under the other Act. The court also cites two relevant judgments, one interpreting Section 20(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the other discussing the delegation of powers under Section 69 of the Act.

The court order discusses the delegation of powers by the Commissioner or Transport Manager to municipal officers for the purpose of initiating legal proceedings. The court concludes that only authorized persons can file complaints under the Act and that the technicalities of non-filing by an authorized person cannot be cured at a later stage. The court also notes that the DPCC did not have the power to authorize the present complainant to file the complaint under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986.

The court order states that the DPCC exceeded its power by authorizing an AEE to file a complaint under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, as only the Chairman or Member Secretary of DPCC were authorized to do so. The complaint was not filed by either of them, and the DPCC did not take any steps to remove the defect in filing the complaint. The court held that the complaint was not maintainable and discharged the accused. The order cites previous judgments to support the importance of proper complaint and appropriate public servant in initiating proceedings.
