The Supreme Court of India heard an appeal in the case of Sethuraman vs Rajamanickam on March 18, 2009. The case involved a criminal complaint filed by the appellant under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, alleging that a cheque signed by the respondent had bounced and the accused had failed to return the money. The respondent filed applications seeking directions to produce the appellant's bank passbooks, income tax accounts, and L.D.S. deposit receipts, which were rejected by the Trial Court. The respondent then filed Criminal Revisions before the High Court, which allowed the same. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order, stating that it was incorrect in law and that the orders passed by the Trial Court were interlocutory in nature, making revision clearly not maintainable.
