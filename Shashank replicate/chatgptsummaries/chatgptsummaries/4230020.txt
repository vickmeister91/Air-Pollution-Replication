Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CR.P.C) empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the court order pertains to two criminal petitions filed under Section 482 of CR.P.C. The accused in the case are being prosecuted for various offenses under IPC.

During the trial, the accused filed two applications, one under Section 91 of CR.P.C and another under Section 311 of CR.P.C. Section 91 of CR.P.C empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing for the purpose of an inquiry or trial. Section 311 of CR.P.C empowers a court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such a step is necessary for the just decision of the case.

The prosecution opposed both applications, and the learned Magistrate rejected the application under Section 91 of CR.P.C but allowed the application under Section 311 of CR.P.C.

The court found no justifiable ground to entertain the petitions and dismissed them. The Trial Court was directed to dispose of the matter expeditiously. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused had failed to establish any justifiable ground for the court to interfere with the trial proceedings. The court also noted that the Trial Court had already allowed the application under Section 311 of CR.P.C, which was sufficient to ensure a fair trial.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the High Court's inherent powers under Section 482 of CR.P.C should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of the court or where it is necessary to secure the ends of justice. The court's decision also highlights the importance of allowing the Trial Court to exercise its discretion in matters relating to the conduct of the trial.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two criminal petitions filed under Section 482 of CR.P.C. The accused in the case are being prosecuted for various offenses under IPC.
