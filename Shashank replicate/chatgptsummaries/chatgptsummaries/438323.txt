The Karnataka High Court reviewed a case where the Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise filed a complaint against India Tobacco Company Limited and its director for alleged evasion of payment of duty under the Central Excise and Salt Act. The complainant filed a supplementary complaint against several others connected with ITC. The court found fault with the procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate in permitting additional accused to be brought in by way of a supplementary complaint. The court also analyzed whether Section 9-AA of the Act, which creates an offense for companies, is substantive or procedural law. The court concluded that Section 9-AA is substantive law creating, for the first time, the offense in respect of two categories of persons, and punishing someone for something done during a period when the said provision was not there would be violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution.

In a similar case, the Gujarat High Court ruled that Section 9-AA of the Central Excise Act cannot be applied retrospectively, as it creates a new offense and would violate Article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution. The court noted that the provision is not procedural, but substantive, as it deems a specific act to be an offense and is made punishable. The court cited several other cases where similar provisions were deemed to be procedural or substantive, depending on the circumstances. The ruling has implications for cases where Section 9-AA is being used to prosecute individuals for actions taken before the provision was introduced.

The court order discusses the applicability of Section 9-AA of the Act and whether it can be applied retrospectively. The court concludes that Section 9-AA creates a new offense against two categories of persons and is not merely clarificatory or declaratory in nature. Therefore, invoking it against the petitioners for their acts of commission and omission during a certain period would be violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution. The court quashes the impugned proceeding against the petitioners.

In summary, the courts have reviewed cases where Section 9-AA of the Central Excise Act was invoked against individuals and companies for alleged evasion of payment of duty. The courts have analyzed whether the provision is substantive or procedural law and whether it can be applied retrospectively. Both the Karnataka High Court and the Gujarat High Court have concluded that Section 9-AA creates a new offense and cannot be applied retrospectively, as it would violate Article 20(1) of the Constitution. The courts have also noted that the provision is not merely clarificatory or declaratory in nature, but deems a specific act to be an offense and is made punishable. These rulings have implications for cases where Section 9-AA is being used to prosecute individuals and companies for actions taken before the provision was introduced.
