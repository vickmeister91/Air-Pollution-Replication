The court order pertains to a dispute between Southend Autotech India Pvt. Ltd. and West Bengal Financial Corporation (WBFC) over the rate of interest payable on a loan. The petitioner has also challenged an annexure D notice issued by WBFC for recovery of the loan under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act 1951. The court discusses the principles of natural justice and the obligation to adopt a judicial approach in quasi-judicial and administrative functions. The court also considers the validity of Section 29 of the Act and the need to afford the party concerned an opportunity to contest the computation of the liability before resorting to the steps authorized under the Act. The court concludes that the matter can be disposed of on the basis of the letter sanctioning the loan and the loan agreement, and that the dispute with regard to interest is not bona fide.

The court order states that there is no fixed formula for the application of the doctrine of fairness in government actions, but compliance with the doctrine depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court must examine the totality of the situation to determine if there has been a breach of the doctrine, and if so, the court has the power to correct the wrong. In this case, the dispute is over the rate of interest charged by the respondent Corporation, and the court determines that the non obstante clause in the sanction letter is not applicable. The respondent Corporation is bound by the circular letter specifying the interest chargeable at 19% per annum, and the court orders the respondent Corporation to calculate the interest at this rate and prepare a statement of the amounts due and payable. The court also directs the petitioner not to alienate, transfer, or encumber the mortgaged and hypothecated assets.
