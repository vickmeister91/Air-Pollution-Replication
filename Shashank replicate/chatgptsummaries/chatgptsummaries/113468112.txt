The Bombay High Court recently heard arguments from both sides regarding the cutting and felling of trees in Mumbai. The respondent stated that the activity was being undertaken with permission from the Tree Authority of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. The petitioner argued that the entire Aarey Colony falls within the definition of "forest" and that the notification permitting use of forest land for Metro Car Depot is in violation of Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court directed that the present petition be heard by the same bench that heard Writ Petition (L) No.2766/2017, which is pending judgment. The court also noted that a similar issue had been raised in PIL (L) No.80/2018, but the prayers in that case were not relevant to the current controversy.

The issue of tree cutting and felling in Mumbai has been a contentious one for some time now. The Aarey Colony, which is located in the northern part of Mumbai, has been the site of much controversy in recent years. The area is home to a large number of trees, and there have been concerns that the cutting and felling of these trees could have a negative impact on the environment.

The petitioner in this case argued that the entire Aarey Colony falls within the definition of "forest" and that the notification permitting use of forest land for Metro Car Depot is in violation of Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the central government.

The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the activity was being undertaken with permission from the Tree Authority of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. The Tree Authority is responsible for granting permission for the cutting and felling of trees in Mumbai.

The court directed that the present petition be heard by the same bench that heard Writ Petition (L) No.2766/2017, which is pending judgment. This suggests that the court is taking a cautious approach to the issue and wants to ensure that all relevant facts are considered before a decision is made.

The court also noted that a similar issue had been raised in PIL (L) No.80/2018, but the prayers in that case were not relevant to the current controversy. This suggests that the court is aware of the broader context of the issue and is taking a holistic approach to the matter.

Overall, the court's decision to direct that the present petition be heard by the same bench that heard Writ Petition (L) No.2766/2017, which is pending judgment, suggests that the court is taking a cautious approach to the issue of tree cutting and felling in Mumbai. The court's decision to consider the broader context of the issue, as evidenced by its reference to PIL (L) No.80/2018, also suggests that the court is aware of the potential impact of its decision on the environment and the people of Mumbai.
