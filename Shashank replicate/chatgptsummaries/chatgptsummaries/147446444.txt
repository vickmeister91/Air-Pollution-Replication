The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Dharam Singh Gond against the State of Chhattisgarh and the Collector of Janjgir-Champa. The petitioner had applied for a lease of land which was recorded as Chhote Jhad Ka Jangal and grassland. However, the Collector rejected the application citing violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The petitioner appealed against this decision, but the State Government affirmed the Collector's order. The court considered whether the land, which was a forest land, could be leased without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court held that prior approval was required for diversion of any forest land and its use for some other purpose.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, such as mining, industrial projects, and infrastructure development. The Act requires prior approval of the Central Government for diversion of any forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act also provides for the constitution of a National Board for Wildlife and State Boards for Wildlife to advise the Central and State Governments on matters relating to wildlife conservation.

The court order states that after the enforcement of the 1980 Act, neither the State Government nor any other authority can make an order of issue direction for de-reservation of reserved forest or any portion thereof or premise use any forest land or any portion thereof by way of lease or otherwise to any private person or to any authority, corporation, agency or organization not owned, managed or controlled by the Government except after obtaining prior approval of the Central Government. The court also held that once land is recorded as "Bade Jhad Ka Jangal" no allotment can be made by the State authorities without obtaining permission of the Central Government.

The court order highlights the importance of gochar land of the village and stated that grassland/grazing land cannot be allotted for any other purpose. Gochar land is the common grazing land of a village, which is used by the villagers for grazing their cattle. The court observed that gochar land is an essential part of the rural economy and any diversion of such land for non-agricultural purposes would adversely affect the livelihood of the villagers.

The court also held that the State Government is justified in rejecting the revision/representation preferred by the petitioner. The petitioner had argued that the land in question was not a forest land and that the Collector had wrongly rejected his application. However, the court found that the land was indeed a forest land and that the Collector had rightly rejected the application.

The court order has significant implications for the conservation of forests and wildlife in the country. It reinforces the importance of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the need for strict compliance with its provisions. It also emphasizes the need to protect gochar land and other common property resources of rural communities. The court order is a reminder to all stakeholders that the conservation of forests and wildlife is a shared responsibility and that any violation of the law will be dealt with strictly.
