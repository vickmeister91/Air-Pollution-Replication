The case in question involved the seizure of a vehicle belonging to Smt. Mamta Dixit by mining officers on the pretext of illegal mining. The State of Madhya Pradesh filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to challenge an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sidhi in an unregistered criminal case. The Magisterial Court had dismissed the interim custody application, but the Additional Sessions Judge remanded the matter to the CJM, who passed an order of interim custody of the vehicle.

The State argued that the vehicle could be confiscated if the accused is convicted in a criminal trial, but the court found that the CJM had the authority to release the vehicle on temporary custody. The court held that the CJM had the power to grant interim custody of the vehicle, and that the State's argument that the vehicle could be confiscated if the accused is convicted in a criminal trial was not relevant to the issue at hand.

The court also noted that the CJM had the power to release the vehicle on temporary custody, and that the State had not shown that the CJM had acted illegally or with material irregularity in passing the order of interim custody. The court therefore dismissed the petition filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the powers of the CJM in granting interim custody of property in criminal cases. It also underscores the need for parties to present relevant arguments and evidence in support of their positions in court. In this case, the State's argument that the vehicle could be confiscated if the accused is convicted in a criminal trial was not relevant to the issue at hand, and the court therefore dismissed the petition.
