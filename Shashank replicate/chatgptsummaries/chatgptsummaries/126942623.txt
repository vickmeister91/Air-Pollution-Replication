The Supreme Court of India recently heard appeals arising from orders passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding the operation of a copper smelter plant by Sterlite Industries in Tamil Nadu. The plant had received various permissions and clearances, but its environmental impact was challenged in court. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) issued show-cause notices and orders for closure, which were stayed by the NGT. The issue of maintainability of the respondent's appeal before the NGT was also raised. The plant continued to operate with conditions and renewals until the TNPCB refused renewal based on non-compliance. The appellate authority adjourned the matter until a government order directed the closure of the plant permanently. The NGT passed an order three days after the appellate authority's order, which is the subject of the present case.

The court order discusses a series of orders and appeals related to the closure of the copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu. The NGT passed an order on 15.12.2018, which was set aside by the Honâ€™ble National Green Tribunal on 18.12.2018. The government of Tamil Nadu issued an order on 28.05.2018 to close the plant permanently. A committee was constituted by the NGT to inspect the site and hear all concerned parties, which concluded that the impugned orders cannot be sustained as it is against the principles of natural justice. The committee suggested certain directions to be issued if the factory should commence production.

The court order requires the appellant company to seek permission from the TNPCB before disposing of waste products and to conduct periodic surveys for ambient air quality, noise level, and stack emission. The company must also develop a green belt around its factory, and the State of Tamil Nadu/TNPCB must monitor the health of inhabitants living in and around the factory premises. The order also includes directions for the construction of a gypsum pond, a hydrogeological study, and independent groundwater sampling. The court found that some of the orders issued by the NGT were without jurisdiction and incompetent. The parties argued about the maintainability of the appeals before the NGT.

The court order discusses the appealability of orders passed under Section 33A of the Water Act and Section 31A of the Air Act. The court concludes that orders under Section 33A of the Water Act are appealable to the NGT, and orders under Section 31A of the Air Act are equivalent to orders under Section 31 and are therefore appealable under Section 16 of the NGT Act. The court also discusses the provisions of the Water Act, including Section 18, which deals with the power to give directions, and Section 25, which imposes restrictions on new outlets and new discharges. The court concludes that the order dated 28.05.2018 of the Government of Tamil Nadu under Section 18 of the Water Act is non est and liable to be ignored because it deals with only one particular industry. The court also notes that the NGT is an expert body constituted specifically under a special Act and is better equipped than the High Court to deal with matters relating to the environment.

The court order outlines the regulations and procedures for obtaining consent from State Boards for the establishment of industries, operations, processes, treatment and disposal systems, and altered outlets. The State Board has the power to impose conditions and review them from time to time. Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Board can appeal to the appellate authority within 30 days. The State Government can revise any order made by the State Board under certain circumstances. The order also includes relevant sections of the Air Act, which outline the restrictions and procedures for obtaining consent for operating industrial plants in air pollution control areas.

The court order outlines regulations for the control equipment and chimney in industries, stating that they cannot be altered or replaced without prior approval from the State Board. If the Board believes that conditions need to be varied, they can do so after giving the person an opportunity to be heard. Appeals can be made to the Appellate Authority within 30 days of the order, and the National Green Tribunal can settle disputes related to environmental damage and provide relief and compensation to victims. The Tribunal also has appellate jurisdiction over orders and decisions made by various authorities under different environmental protection acts.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and its power to hear appeals related to environmental clearance and benefit sharing. It also states that civil courts cannot entertain appeals related to matters that fall under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The order also discusses two previous judgments related to the maintainability of appeals before the Tribunal. The court ultimately finds that the appeals in question are maintainable and within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The court order discusses the appeal of a rejected renewal of consent to operate under the Water Act and Air Act. The court states that an appeal against such an order is appealable to the appellate authority and then to the NGT. The court notes that while an appeal was pending before the appellate authority, the NGT took up a matter directly against the original order. The court cites previous judgments to emphasize that appeal is a creature of the statute and that the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal depends on the relevant statute. The court concludes that the appeal cannot be rejected on the ground of maintainability as there is no inherent lack of jurisdiction to entertain the same.
