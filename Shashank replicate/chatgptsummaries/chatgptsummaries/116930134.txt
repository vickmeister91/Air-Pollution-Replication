The Chhattisgarh High Court recently heard a criminal petition filed by Sunil Agrawal against the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board and the State of Chhattisgarh. Agrawal was standing trial for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. He argued that the complaint filed against him was not maintainable as it was filed by the Regional Officer of the Board, who was not authorized by the Board. The court found that Section 43 of the Air Act is mandatory and that the court would not take cognizance of the offence if the complaint is not filed by the Board or any officer authorized by the Board. The court referred to a previous Supreme Court decision that held that the delegated power cannot be further delegated.

The court order discusses the delegation of power to file complaints under the Air Act. The Chairman of the Board was authorized to file complaints, but could not further delegate this authority without a clear mandate of law. The Regional Officer who filed the complaint in this case was not authorized to do so, and therefore the complaints were set aside. The court allowed the respondent Board to initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with the law within two months.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the provisions of the law. The court's decision emphasizes that the delegated power cannot be further delegated, and that only authorized officers can file complaints under the Air Act. This ensures that the law is followed and that individuals are not unfairly targeted or prosecuted.

The court's decision also underscores the need for clear mandates of law when delegating authority. The Chairman of the Board was authorized to file complaints, but this authority could not be further delegated without a clear mandate of law. This ensures that there is accountability and transparency in the delegation of authority, and that individuals are not unfairly targeted or prosecuted.

It ensures that only authorized officers can file complaints under the Air Act, which helps to prevent abuse of power and ensures that the law is followed. It also underscores the importance of clear mandates of law when delegating authority, which helps to ensure accountability and transparency in the enforcement of environmental laws.
