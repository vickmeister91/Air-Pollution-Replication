The court order pertains to various disputes over land ownership and the issuance of certificates under the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. The order lists the plot numbers and documents of the implead petitioners and outlines the conditions under which a tenant can be deemed a protected tenant, including continuous tenancy for at least six years and personal cultivation of the land. The court found that any alleged correction or alteration without putting the legal heirs of the PT on notice is illegal and without any authority of law and in violation of provisions of the Act and principles of natural justice. The court also found that the un-official respondents do not have any claim over the land covered by Sy.No.27/2 and Sy.No.27/3 as they are not the PTs. The court allowed the revisions filed by the petitioners.

In another case, the court found that the original protected tenants were the rightful owners of the land in question and that the unofficial respondents had no claim to it. The court ordered that the 38-E certificate issued in favor of the unofficial respondents be set aside and that the petitioners be granted the Section 38-E certificates and have their names mutated in the revenue records. The court also considered relevant principles and propositions related to the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act of 1950.

The court also discussed various cases related to the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. It covers topics such as protected tenancy, ownership certificates, surrender of tenancy rights, and the jurisdiction of officials in granting succession to protected tenants. The court emphasizes the need for reasonable time in filing applications and exercising powers under the Act, and the importance of following statutory provisions. The order also highlights the limited category of protected tenants and the significance of their rights under the Act.

The court found that the dismissal of appeals by the Joint Collector was unsustainable and set aside the dismissal appeal orders. The matters will be determined according to law and on merits, preferably within six months. The court has also closed any pending miscellaneous petitions.
