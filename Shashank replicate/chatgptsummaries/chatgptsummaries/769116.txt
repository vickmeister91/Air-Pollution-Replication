The Supreme Court of India recently issued a court order in a case filed by The Goan Real Estate & Construction Ltd. The company had filed a petition to declare that their building plans and constructions made pursuant to the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification dated February 19, 1991, as amended by the Notification dated August 16, 1994, issued by the Central Government are valid. The court examined the validity of the amendments made to the notification and found that the reduction of the ban on construction from 100 meters to 50 meters was illegal and the power given to the Central Government for relaxation of developmental activities in the entire 6,000 kilometers long coast line was unbridled and capable of being abused.

The court also found that the reduction could not be regarded as a protection only to the existing structures and was contrary to the object of the Environment Act. The court partially accepted the petition by striking down two amendments introduced by the notification dated August 16, 1994. The court also examined the constructions made by the petitioners and found that they were in violation of CRZ guidelines. The court issued clarifications regarding the on-going projects and the No Development Zone.

The court order pertains to a case in Goa where construction work was stopped due to violation of coastal zone regulations. The Ministry of Environment had issued clarifications on the matter, but the stop work orders were not lifted. The case went to court, and the Central Government stated that the project was an ongoing one. The court directed the National Coastal Zone Management Authority to consider the matter and submit a report. The Authority concluded that constructions made or ongoing pursuant to plans sanctioned on the basis of a 1994 notification would not be affected. The court examined the judgment in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action and concluded that it was intended to have prospective effect. The court allowed the petitioners to amend their petition to challenge the Authority's order.

The court order declares that a previous judgment will have prospective effect and will not affect ongoing or completed constructions that were initiated between August 16, 1994, and April 18, 1996, after obtaining all necessary clearances. The court considered various factors while giving prospective operation to the judgment and refused to interpret it in a manner that would give it retrospective effect. The court also rejected the contention that incomplete constructions cannot be completed and declared that all orders passed under the amending notification and actions taken pursuant to it would not be affected. The petition partly succeeded, and the rule was made absolute to the extent indicated in the order.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case in Goa where The Goan Real Estate & Construction Ltd. filed a petition to declare that their building plans and constructions made pursuant to the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification dated February 19, 1991, as amended by the Notification dated August 16, 1994, issued by the Central Government are valid.
