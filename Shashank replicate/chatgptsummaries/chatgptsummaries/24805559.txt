Indian Bank had filed a writ petition seeking a direction to sell hypothecated movables, such as finished goods/semi-finished goods/raw materials, etc., in public auction to recover dues from M/s. PRP Exports. The bank argued that, as a secured creditor, they have the right to sell the property to recover the dues. However, the State of Tamil Nadu opposed the petition, stating that the seized granite blocks, finished goods/semi-finished goods, raw materials, etc., are part of criminal investigations and case properties. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that it is too early to decide whether the fifth respondent/firm has any right over the properties, as the criminal investigations are ongoing.
