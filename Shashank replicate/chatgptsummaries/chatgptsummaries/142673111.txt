The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed a civil appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The case pertained to environmental damage caused by the dumping of waste in the city. The National Green Tribunal had earlier directed the Municipal Corporation to pay compensation for the damage caused and to deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund established under Section 24 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad had challenged the order of the National Green Tribunal before the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court upheld the order of the National Green Tribunal and dismissed the appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation. The court also directed the appellant to deposit the costs/compensation awarded by the National Green Tribunal within four weeks in the Environmental Relief Fund.

The National Green Tribunal had passed the order in response to a petition filed by a group of residents of Ghaziabad. The petitioners had alleged that the Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad was dumping waste in a park in the city, which was causing environmental damage and health hazards to the residents. The National Green Tribunal had found the allegations to be true and had directed the Municipal Corporation to pay compensation for the damage caused.

The Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad had argued before the Supreme Court that the National Green Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to pass the order as the matter fell within the purview of the Municipal Corporation Act. However, the Supreme Court rejected this argument and held that the National Green Tribunal had the power to pass orders in matters relating to environmental damage.

The Supreme Court also observed that the Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad had failed to discharge its duty of ensuring proper waste management in the city. The court noted that the Municipal Corporation had not taken any steps to prevent the dumping of waste in the park despite being aware of the same. The court held that the Municipal Corporation was liable to pay compensation for the damage caused and directed it to deposit the same in the Environmental Relief Fund.

The Environmental Relief Fund established under Section 24 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is a fund created for the purpose of providing relief and compensation to persons and communities affected by environmental damage. The fund is managed by the National Green Tribunal and is used to provide compensation to victims of environmental damage and to undertake remedial measures to restore the environment.

The Supreme Court's order in this case is significant as it reaffirms the power of the National Green Tribunal to pass orders in matters relating to environmental damage. The order also highlights the importance of proper waste management and the need for local authorities to take proactive steps to prevent environmental damage.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the civil appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation of Ghaziabad against the order of the National Green Tribunal is a welcome development in the fight against environmental damage. The court's direction to deposit the compensation awarded in the Environmental Relief Fund is a step towards ensuring that victims of environmental damage are adequately compensated and that remedial measures are undertaken to restore the environment. The order also serves as a reminder to local authorities to discharge their duty of ensuring proper waste management and preventing environmental damage.
