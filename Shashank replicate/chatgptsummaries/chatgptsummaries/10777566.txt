The court order pertains to a criminal original petition filed by the petitioner, M. Arulselvam, under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner had sought a direction from the Judicial Magistrate Court No.1 at Mettur to entertain his petition under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, during the hearing, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition, which was granted by the court. As a result, the criminal original petition was dismissed as withdrawn and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. Similarly, Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the issuance of a summons or order to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

In this case, it is not clear what the petitioner's original petition under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was about, as the court order does not provide any details. However, it appears that the petitioner had approached the Judicial Magistrate Court No.1 at Mettur with his petition, but the court had refused to entertain it. Hence, the petitioner had filed the criminal original petition before the High Court, seeking a direction to the lower court to entertain his petition.

During the hearing of the criminal original petition, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition. It is not clear why the petitioner's counsel made this request, as the court order does not provide any reasons. However, it is possible that the petitioner may have decided to withdraw his petition for some reason, such as a settlement with the other party or a change in circumstances.

The court granted permission to the petitioner's counsel to withdraw the petition, and as a result, the criminal original petition was dismissed as withdrawn. This means that the petition was not decided on its merits, as the court did not have the opportunity to hear and decide the issues raised in the petition. Instead, the petition was simply withdrawn by the petitioner, with the court's permission.

The court also closed the connected miscellaneous petition, which is likely to be a petition filed by the petitioner seeking some relief or direction in connection with the criminal original petition. Since the criminal original petition was dismissed as withdrawn, there was no need to consider the miscellaneous petition any further, and hence, the court closed it.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal original petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking a direction to the lower court to entertain his petition under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, during the hearing, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the petition, which was granted by the court. As a result, the criminal original petition was dismissed as withdrawn and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed. The reasons for the withdrawal of the petition are not clear from the court order.
