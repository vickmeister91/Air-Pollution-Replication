The case of Anand Timber, a petitioner who had applied for the renewal of their Saw Mill license, was brought before the court. The Divisional Forest Officer, Deoghar, had rejected their application citing a Supreme Court decision that no new licenses could be granted after December 12, 1996. However, the court found that the Supreme Court had only directed the closure of unlicensed Saw Mills in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and had not issued a blanket ban on renewals or new licenses for Saw Mills outside forest areas.

The court noted that the petitioner had been operating their Saw Mill for many years and had been renewing their license regularly. The court also observed that the petitioner had not been given any opportunity to be heard before the rejection of their application. The court held that the authorities had acted arbitrarily and without any legal basis in rejecting the petitioner's application.

The court ordered the authorities to reconsider the application and pass an appropriate order if there was no legal impediment. The court also directed the authorities to give the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before passing any order. The court emphasized that the authorities should act in accordance with the law and not arbitrarily.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope of the Supreme Court's decision on Saw Mills. The court's interpretation of the Supreme Court's decision is that it only applies to unlicensed Saw Mills in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and does not prohibit renewals or new licenses for Saw Mills outside forest areas. This interpretation provides clarity to Saw Mill operators who may have been uncertain about the legality of renewing their licenses.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of procedural fairness in administrative decision-making. The court found that the authorities had acted arbitrarily and without any legal basis in rejecting the petitioner's application. The court emphasized that the authorities should act in accordance with the law and give the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before passing any order.
