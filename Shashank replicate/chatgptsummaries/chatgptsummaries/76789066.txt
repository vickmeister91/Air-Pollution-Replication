The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition seeking a mandamus to stop a pig farm from operating without a license or statutory clearance. The court found that the appellant was not entitled to run the farm without a proper license and ordered it to be closed down within two weeks. The court emphasized that obtaining a license was a legal necessity and that the appellant could pursue other remedies. The court modified the judgment to grant two weeks for the farm to be closed down.

In another court order, a text appeared to be a signature and certification of a court order by two judges, K. M. Joseph and A. Hariprasad. However, without the context of the actual court order, it is impossible to provide a meaningful summary.
