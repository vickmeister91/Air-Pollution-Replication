The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner has sought the quashing of an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in a pollution control case. Additionally, the petitioner has requested the quashing of the entire criminal proceedings arising out of the case.

The court has taken note of the petition and issued notice to the opposite party. The petitioner has been granted interim protection until the next hearing date. The court has also directed that no coercive steps shall be taken against the petitioner until then.

The case in question appears to be related to pollution control. It is not clear from the available information what specific allegations have been made against the petitioner. However, it is clear that the petitioner is seeking to have the case against them quashed entirely.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. This section is often invoked in cases where a party seeks to have a case against them quashed.

In this case, the court has taken note of the petition and issued notice to the opposite party. The petitioner has been granted interim protection until the next hearing date. This means that the petitioner cannot be arrested or otherwise subjected to coercive measures until the next hearing date.

It is not clear from the available information what the next steps in the case will be. However, it is likely that the court will hear arguments from both sides and make a decision on whether to quash the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and/or the entire criminal proceedings arising out of the case.

It is important to note that the court has not made any final decision in this case. The interim protection granted to the petitioner is only temporary, and the court will need to hear arguments from both sides before making a final decision.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. This section provides a mechanism for parties to seek relief from the court in cases where they believe that the process of the court is being abused or where they believe that justice requires a particular order to be made. It will be interesting to see how this case develops and what the final decision of the court will be.
