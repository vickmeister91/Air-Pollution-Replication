The court order in question pertains to a case filed by M/s Shah Brothers against the Union of India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the State of Jharkhand, and the Divisional Forest Officer, Saranda Forest Division, Chaibasa. The petitioner challenged circulars and letters issued by the respondents as being ultra vires, and argued that the Divisional Forest Officer cannot insist on payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire forest area when clearance for a portion of the leasehold area is still pending.

The court allowed three weeks' time for the respondents to file a counter affidavit and directed that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner in the meantime. The petitioner subsequently filed a supplementary affidavit stating that it had proposed surrendering a part of its leasehold area and was in the process of preparing its final Mine Closure Plan.

The court order states that the petitioner intends to surrender a part of its lease area and has already communicated this to the DMO. The petitioner also intends to work on the remaining forest area within its mining lease and is willing to deposit the NPV for the area proposed to be retained. The petitioner undertakes to deposit NPV for the remaining virgin forest land and does not intend to press the challenge made in the writ petition. The writ petition is dismissed as not pressed.
