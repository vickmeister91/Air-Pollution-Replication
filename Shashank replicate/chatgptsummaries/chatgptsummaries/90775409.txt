The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri B M Gangaiah and others against the State of Karnataka and others. The petitioners challenged three government notifications dated 11.06.2012, which granted permission for multi-coloured granite quarrying in Tavarekere village, Kunigal taluk, Tumkur district. The court heard arguments on the legality of the notifications and observed that they were couched in language that gave the impression of sanction for quarrying. The court reserved its judgment on the matter.

The court order outlines the requirements for obtaining consent and certificates for mining in areas belonging to the Forest Department and the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority. The court also discusses the relevant provisions of the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, including Rules 8-A and 8-B, which prescribe the procedure for granting land for quarrying. The court notes that the government must follow a transparent process, such as public auction, to dispose of public property and that failure to do so would be arbitrary and unconstitutional. The court also cites a previous judgment that emphasizes the importance of notifying the public of available land for lease.

The court order states that the government cannot grant lease for quarrying any specified or non-specified minor mineral from any area belonging to the State Government without notifying such area under Rule 8-B and without adopting the method of tender-cum-auction for granting lease for such area. The court found the notifications issued by the respondents to be illegal and in violation of the express provisions of the Rules. The petition was allowed and the impugned notifications were quashed.
