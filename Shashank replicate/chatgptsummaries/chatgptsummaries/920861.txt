The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a practicing advocate in Bangalore, K.K. Vasant, under Article 226 of the Constitution. The petition is in public interest and seeks relief for the absence of provisions in the Forest Act, 1963, to keep a check on the action of the respondents to achieve the intent of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976. The petitioner's chief grievance is that the legislation governing the subject of preservation of forests and protection of animals therein falls short of the requirements of cultivation and scientific exploitation of the forests.

The State of Karnataka has filed its statement of objections, contending that the reliefs asked for are not tenable and that the enactments made are adequate to meet all requirements. The court refers to the case of Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of U.P. and the directions issued by the Supreme Court in that case to ensure quarrying did not affect the existing forest wealth.

The court order states that the judiciary must function within the parameters set by the Constitution and not interfere with matters of policy or law-making. The petitioner's request cannot be construed as conferring powers to interfere with daily routine administration or law-making. The court cannot grant any of the prayers or mold the reliefs in any other form.

The petitioner must make a written demand calling upon the government to perform its statutory duties before seeking a writ of mandamus. The court advises the petitioner to move the concerned legislators to take initiative and fill up any lacuna pointed out by any expert committee. The court dismisses the petition and rejects the oral motion for a Certificate of Fitness to appeal.
