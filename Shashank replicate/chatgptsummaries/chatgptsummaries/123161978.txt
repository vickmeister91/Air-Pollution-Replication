The court has issued a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) with various suggestions for the comprehensive medical check-up of all workers in coal-fired thermal power stations, free medical treatment for workers suffering from occupational diseases, and compensation for workers suffering from any occupational disease, ailment or accident. The court has also suggested the use of modern protective equipment and strict control measures for the control of dust, heat, noise, vibration, and radiation.

The PIL was filed in response to the increasing number of cases of occupational diseases and accidents among workers in coal-fired thermal power stations. The court noted that these workers are exposed to various health hazards due to the nature of their work, including exposure to coal dust, heat, noise, vibration, and radiation.

The court has suggested that all workers in coal-fired thermal power stations should undergo a comprehensive medical check-up at least once a year. The check-up should include a detailed examination of the worker's respiratory system, cardiovascular system, nervous system, and musculoskeletal system. The court has also suggested that the medical check-up should be conducted by a qualified medical practitioner and should be free of cost for the workers.

The court has also suggested that workers suffering from occupational diseases should be provided with free medical treatment. The treatment should be provided by a qualified medical practitioner and should be of a high standard. The court has noted that many workers suffering from occupational diseases are unable to afford the cost of medical treatment and therefore do not receive the necessary treatment.

The court has also suggested that workers suffering from any occupational disease, ailment or accident should be provided with compensation. The compensation should be provided by the employer and should be commensurate with the severity of the disease, ailment or accident. The court has noted that many workers suffering from occupational diseases or accidents are unable to work and therefore suffer a loss of income. The compensation should therefore take into account the loss of income suffered by the worker.

The court has also suggested that modern protective equipment should be used by workers in coal-fired thermal power stations. The equipment should be of a high standard and should be regularly maintained. The court has noted that many workers do not use protective equipment due to the cost of the equipment or due to a lack of awareness of the importance of using protective equipment.

The court has also suggested that strict control measures should be implemented for the control of dust, heat, noise, vibration, and radiation. The measures should be regularly monitored and should be of a high standard. The court has noted that many workers are exposed to high levels of dust, heat, noise, vibration, and radiation due to a lack of control measures.

The court has adjourned the matter to be enlisted on 10.02.2015. This means that the matter will be heard again on 10.02.2015 and the court will consider any further submissions or evidence that may be presented. The court has noted that it is committed to ensuring the health and safety of workers in coal-fired thermal power stations and will take all necessary steps to achieve this goal.

In conclusion, the court has issued a PIL with various suggestions for the comprehensive medical check-up of all workers in coal-fired thermal power stations, free medical treatment for workers suffering from occupational diseases, and compensation for workers suffering from any occupational disease, ailment or accident. The court has also suggested the use of modern protective equipment and strict control measures for the control of dust, heat, noise, vibration, and radiation. The court has adjourned the matter to be enlisted on 10.02.2015 and is committed to ensuring the health and safety of workers in coal-fired thermal power stations.
