The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Mohsim Ali against his conviction under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for unauthorizedly keeping endangered species of birds. The appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and pay a fine of Rs 25,000/-.

In another court order, the court allowed the appeal of the convict who was sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000 for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court condoned the delay in filing the appeal and directed that the substantive sentence of rigorous imprisonment for three years shall run concurrently with previous sentences awarded to him in other cases. However, the default sentence shall remain as it is and would start on completion of the period of substantive sentence in case the amount of fine remains unpaid. The court also mentioned that the appellant has been convicted in not less than 15 identical cases and that the minimum sentence prescribed for second or subsequent offences under the second proviso to section 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 had to be awarded. The court exercised its discretion in favor of the appellant and allowed the appeal partly.

The appeal challenges the severity of the sentence and requests that the sentences run concurrently with other cases. The court allows the appeal in part, ordering that the substantive sentence of rigorous imprisonment for three years shall run concurrently with previous sentences awarded to the appellant in other cases, but the default sentence shall remain as it is. The court also condones the delay in filing the appeal.
