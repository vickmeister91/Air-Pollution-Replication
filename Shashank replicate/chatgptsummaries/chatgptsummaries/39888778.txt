The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by Smt. B.V. Spoorthy against Sri Varunkumar B.R. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Prl. Family Judge, Bangalore city in Crl.Misc.No.690/13 on the application u/S.91 of Cr.P.C. However, the court dismissed the petition as the necessary documents had already been produced before the court below.

The case at hand appears to have involved a dispute between Smt. B.V. Spoorthy and Sri Varunkumar B.R. The details of the dispute are not provided in the court order, but it is clear that the petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Prl. Family Judge in Bangalore city. The order in question had been passed on an application made under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.).

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is intended to ensure that all relevant documents and materials are made available to the court so that it can make an informed decision in the matter before it.

In this case, it appears that the petitioner had challenged the order passed by the Prl. Family Judge on the grounds that the necessary documents had not been produced before the court. However, the court dismissed the petition on the basis that the documents had already been produced before the court below. It is not clear from the court order whether the documents were produced voluntarily or whether a summons or order had been issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition suggests that it was satisfied that all relevant documents had been produced before the court below. This would have enabled the court to make an informed decision on the matter before it. It is not clear from the court order what the decision of the Prl. Family Judge was, or whether it was challenged in any other way.

Overall, the court order in question provides limited information about the case at hand. It appears to have involved a dispute between Smt. B.V. Spoorthy and Sri Varunkumar B.R., and the petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Prl. Family Judge in Bangalore city on the grounds that the necessary documents had not been produced before the court. However, the court dismissed the petition on the basis that the documents had already been produced before the court below. The order provides no further information about the nature of the dispute or the decision of the Prl. Family Judge.
