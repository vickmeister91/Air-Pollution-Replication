The State of Madhya Pradesh filed a revision against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sabalgarh District Morena, in which the seized vehicle was given temporary custody to the respondent. The vehicle was recovered by the Forest Officer due to contravention of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Court found that the vehicle was not recovered under the Forest Act or any other law in which the parallel confiscation proceeding could be initiated, and the power of the Magistrate to grant vehicle on interim custody would have been restricted. The revisionary Court has rightly mentioned that the decision of Full Bench of this Court in the case of "Madhukar Rao State of M.P. & others" (2001 JLJ 304) is applicable in the present case. The Court dismissed the revision filed by the State, and the record of criminal revision was sent to the revisionary Court along with a copy of the order.

The Full Bench of the Court in the case of "Madhukar Rao State of M.P. & others" (2001 JLJ 304) had held that the power of the Magistrate to grant interim custody of the seized vehicle is restricted to the cases where the vehicle is seized under the Forest Act or any other law in which the parallel confiscation proceeding could be initiated. In the present case, the vehicle was not seized under any such law, and hence the Magistrate did not have the power to grant interim custody of the vehicle.

The Court also observed that the power of the Magistrate to grant interim custody of the seized vehicle is not absolute and is subject to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The Court further held that the Magistrate can grant interim custody of the seized vehicle only if he is satisfied that the vehicle is not required for the purpose of investigation or trial and that its custody will not cause any prejudice to the investigation or trial.

In the present case, the Court found that the Magistrate had granted interim custody of the seized vehicle without considering these factors. The Court also observed that the Magistrate had not given any reasons for granting interim custody of the vehicle. The Court, therefore, held that the order passed by the Magistrate was illegal and unsustainable.
