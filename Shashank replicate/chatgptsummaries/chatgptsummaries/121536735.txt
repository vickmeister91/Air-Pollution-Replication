The case at hand involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Indra Singh against the State of Rajasthan. The petitioner had challenged the order rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court, in its order, observed that Section 243 Cr.P.C. is the prescribed procedure for the defence and all witnesses as well as documents can be compelled to be produced for the purpose of examination and cross-examination.

The court, while acknowledging that Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers the court to issue summons to produce documents, observed that the said provision cannot be used as a substitute for the procedure prescribed under Section 243 Cr.P.C. The court noted that the procedure under Section 243 Cr.P.C. is more comprehensive and provides for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, which is essential for a fair trial.

The court, therefore, directed the lower court to follow the prescribed procedure under Section 243 Cr.P.C. and conduct a speedy trial. The court emphasized the need for expeditious disposal of the case and directed the lower court to conclude the trial as soon as possible.
