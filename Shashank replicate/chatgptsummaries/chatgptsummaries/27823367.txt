The Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act 2007 was enacted to prevent the defacement of public and private property in Delhi.

The Act also provides for penalties for those found guilty of defacement, including fines and imprisonment.

In the case of Mahesh Tanwar, the prosecution argued that he had violated Section 3 of the Act by affixing a hoarding on a government telephone pole. The prosecution examined four witnesses in an attempt to prove their case, but the accused pleaded not guilty.

Ultimately, the court acquitted the accused, citing a previous judgment that stated putting up a banner or poster would not be covered under Section 3 of the Act.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of understanding the scope and limitations of laws related to defacement of property. While the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act 2007 provides for penalties for those found guilty of defacement, it is important to note that not all forms of defacement are covered under the Act.

In this case, the court found that affixing a hoarding on a government telephone pole did not constitute defacement under the Act. This decision is in line with previous judgments that have held that putting up a banner or poster would not be covered under Section 3 of the Act.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the scope and limitations of laws related to defacement of property. While the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act 2007 provides for penalties for those found guilty of defacement, it is important to carefully consider the specific circumstances of each case to determine whether a violation of the Act has occurred.
