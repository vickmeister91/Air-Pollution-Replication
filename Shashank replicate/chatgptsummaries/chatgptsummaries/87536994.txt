The court order in question pertains to an application for bail filed by a man named Shankar, who was arrested for hunting a wild animal, specifically a leopard, and for putting clutch wire in his agricultural fields. According to forest officials who reached the scene, they saw the leopard lying snared in the clutch wire. The postmortem report revealed that there was a linear mark of 1 cm bit present in and around the proximal extremity of the pelvic bone, which strangulated the muscle of the pelvic cavity.

Despite the severity of the charges against him, the court ultimately allowed Shankar's application for bail. The court directed that the applicant be enlarged on bail upon his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.

It is important to note that hunting wild animals is illegal in India, and the penalties for doing so can be quite severe. In this case, Shankar was not only charged with hunting a leopard, but also with putting clutch wire in his agricultural fields, which is likely to have caused harm to other animals as well. The fact that the leopard was found snared in the wire suggests that Shankar's actions were not only illegal, but also cruel and inhumane.

Despite the seriousness of the charges against him, however, Shankar was ultimately granted bail. This decision may have been influenced by a number of factors, including the fact that he had no prior criminal record, and that he was able to provide a personal bond and a solvent surety. It is also possible that the court took into account the fact that Shankar had been in custody for some time, and that he was not considered to be a flight risk.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following the law when it comes to hunting and other activities that may harm wildlife. While it is understandable that people may want to protect their crops and livestock from wild animals, it is important to do so in a way that is both legal and humane. In cases where individuals are found to have violated the law, it is up to the courts to determine the appropriate punishment, which may include fines, imprisonment, or other penalties. In this case, Shankar was granted bail, but he will still need to face trial and potentially face further consequences for his actions.
