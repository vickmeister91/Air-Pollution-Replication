The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases filed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, in India. The first case involves Mohan Lal Relia and others who were accused of violating the Act on May 28, 1998. The complainant was a Wild Life Inspector in Delhi, and the accused pleaded not guilty. The final order acquitted accused no. 2 to 4 for the offense punishable under section 51 of the Act, while accused no. 5's summary ends abruptly.

The second case was filed on February 3, 2000, against several accused for violating sections 49 and 49B(1) of the Act. The accused were found in possession of shawls made from the wool of Tibetan Antelope, which is specified in Schedule-I of the Act. One of the accused was convicted for the offense under section 51 of the Act. The prosecution examined several witnesses, and a charge was framed against all the accused. One of the witnesses could not be examined in post-charge evidence as he had passed away. Dr. S.P. Goyal examined the sample shawls and proved the report.

The third case describes a situation where the accused were charged with possession of shahtoosh shawls made of Tibetan Antelope without a license for the purpose of sale. The prosecution presented witnesses who testified to the seizure of the shawls from the accused company's premises. The defense argued that the accused were falsely implicated and that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be credible and convicted the accused under relevant provisions of the Act.

The fourth case discusses the inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses, stating that minor discrepancies should not be given undue importance. The prosecution has proved that the case property was recovered from the premises of accused no. 5, who was found to be indulged in the business of Shahtoosh shawls without a permit or license. Accused no. 2 cannot be convicted as there is no evidence to show that he was the Executive Director of the company. Accused no. 3 and 4 cannot be convicted as they were salesmen/employees of the company, and other directors were not investigated. The court holds accused no. 5 liable for contravening the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The fifth case found the company guilty of violating sections 49 and 49B(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which is punishable under section 51 of the same act. The company is convicted for the offense, while three individuals are acquitted. The case property, if any, will be confiscated to the state. The court will hear the sentence for the convicted company.

In conclusion, all of these court orders involve violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, in India. The prosecution presented evidence in each case, and the court examined the evidence to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. In some cases, the accused were acquitted, while in others, they were convicted. The court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting wildlife and the consequences of violating the law.
