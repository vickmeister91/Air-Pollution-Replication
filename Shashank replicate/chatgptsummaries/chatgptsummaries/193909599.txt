In a case filed by G. Sundarrajan against the Union of India and others regarding the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, the court had given 15 directions for compliance by various entities. However, the petitioner alleged that these directions had not been followed. The respondents filed affidavits and status reports indicating that they were taking necessary steps to comply with the directions. After considering the submissions of both parties, the court found no reason to give any further directions at the moment. The Special Leave Petition was disposed of accordingly.

The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project has been a controversial issue in India, with concerns raised about its safety and environmental impact. G. Sundarrajan, a social activist, had filed a case in the court seeking to stop the project. The court had given 15 directions for compliance by various entities involved in the project, including the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF).

The directions included measures to ensure the safety of the project, such as the installation of a passive heat removal system and the creation of an emergency preparedness plan. The court had also directed the NPCIL to set up a panel of independent experts to review the safety of the project.

However, the petitioner alleged that these directions had not been followed and sought the court's intervention. The respondents, on the other hand, filed affidavits and status reports indicating that they were taking necessary steps to comply with the directions. They argued that the project was crucial for meeting India's energy needs and that all necessary precautions were being taken to ensure its safety.

After considering the submissions of both parties, the court found no reason to give any further directions at the moment. The court noted that the NPCIL had already taken several steps to comply with the directions, such as the installation of a passive heat removal system and the creation of an emergency preparedness plan. The court also noted that the AERB had conducted several safety reviews of the project and that the MoEF had granted environmental clearance for the project.

The court, however, directed the NPCIL to continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the project. The court also directed the AERB to conduct periodic safety reviews of the project and to submit its reports to the court. The court further directed the MoEF to monitor the environmental impact of the project and to take appropriate measures to mitigate any adverse effects.

In conclusion, the court order in the case filed by G. Sundarrajan against the Union of India and others regarding the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project directed various entities involved in the project to comply with 15 directions for ensuring its safety. The court found no reason to give any further directions at the moment, but directed the NPCIL, AERB, and MoEF to continue to take necessary steps to ensure the safety and environmental impact of the project.
