The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab, Chandigarh issued a court order on January 8, 2020, in the case of Mohinder Singh vs Altus Space Builders Pvt. Ltd. The complaint was filed under Section 17(1)(a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, seeking a refund of Rs. 30,40,001/- with interest, compensation for mental harassment, litigation charges, and traveling expenses. The complainants alleged that the opposite parties delayed the delivery of possession of a residential plot and violated the provisions of PAPRA. The opposite parties argued that they had environmental clearance and the agreement contained an arbitration clause.

The court order pertains to a consumer complaint filed against a real estate developer for not delivering possession of a plot within the stipulated time frame. The developer argued that the complainants were investors and not consumers, and that the matter should be referred to arbitration. However, the court rejected these objections and held that the complainants were consumers under the Consumer Protection Act. The court also noted that similar cases had been decided in favor of the complainants. The court ordered the developer to deliver possession of the plot and pay compensation for the delay.

The court order states that the seller must make their best efforts to complete the development of a plot/project within 30 months or an extended period of 6 months from the date of signing the agreement. If the seller is unable to offer the plot, they must provide an alternative property or refund the full amount with interest. The complainants paid Rs. 30,40,069/- to the opposite parties, but the opposite parties failed to complete the development works and deliver possession of the plot. The opposite parties claimed that the development works were at the final stage, but no evidence was provided. The Hon'ble National Commission held that legal possession cannot be delivered in the absence of a completion certificate issued by the competent authority. The opposite parties failed to produce a completion certificate, which is a violation of PAPRA. The opposite parties also violated various provisions of PAPRA, including Section 3 and Section 5.

The court order states that the builders/developers violated Section 5 and Section 9 of PAPRA by not obtaining permission for developing the colony and not maintaining a separate account for depositing the amount collected from buyers. The complainant suffered mental agony and harassment due to the builder's misrepresentation and deception, resulting in injury and loss of opportunity. The court ordered the builders to refund the deposited amount with interest and pay compensation for mental tension and harassment suffered by the complainant, including litigation costs. The builders were directed to comply with the order within a month.
