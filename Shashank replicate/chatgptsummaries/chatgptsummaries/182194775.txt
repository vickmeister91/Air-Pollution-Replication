The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in response to two writ petitions filed by Reni Jacob George and a quarry operator. The petitioner, Reni Jacob George, had raised concerns about the quarry operator's crushing operations and stocking of overburden, which had resulted in a mound of ordinary earth and M-sand forming on the petitioner's property. The petitioner argued that this was likely to cause pollution and other inconvenience to him.

The Pollution Control Board had previously directed the quarry operator to stop the functioning of the crusher unit until the crusher sand waste was removed from the area near the property of Reni Jacob George. However, the court found that the objections that initially informed the Pollution Control Board no longer existed. The quarry operator had since remedied the situation to the satisfaction of the Pollution Control Board and the Geologist.

As a result, the court closed the writ petition filed by the quarry operator and closed the writ petition filed by Reni Jacob George without prejudice to his right to approach the statutory authority if and when there is a cause of action that arises for approaching the said authorities in connection with the mining activities carried out by the quarry operator.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the evidence presented by both parties. The court found that the quarry operator had taken appropriate steps to address the concerns raised by the petitioner and the Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to suggest that the quarry operator's activities were causing pollution or other harm to the environment.

The court's decision highlights the importance of balancing the interests of different parties in cases involving mining and quarrying activities. While it is important to protect the environment and the rights of individuals who may be affected by such activities, it is also important to ensure that legitimate business activities are not unduly hampered by unfounded complaints.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides a clear example of how courts can carefully consider the evidence presented by different parties and make decisions that are fair and reasonable. It also underscores the importance of following established procedures and regulations when engaging in mining and quarrying activities, in order to minimize the risk of harm to the environment and to individuals who may be affected by such activities.
