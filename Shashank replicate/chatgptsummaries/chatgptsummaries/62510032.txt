In a recent court order, Dhaniram was granted bail in a case where he was accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. The court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case but considered several factors before granting bail.

One of the factors considered by the court was the severity of punishment in case of conviction. The court recognized that the charges against Dhaniram were serious and could result in a significant prison sentence. However, the court also noted that bail is a fundamental right and should not be denied unless there are compelling reasons to do so.

Another factor considered by the court was the nature of supporting evidence. The court noted that the evidence against Dhaniram was not particularly strong and that there were several inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. The court also noted that some of the witnesses in the case were known to be unreliable and that there was a possibility of tempering with witnesses.

Based on these factors, the court granted bail to Dhaniram. However, the court also imposed certain conditions on his bail. These conditions included appearing before the trial court on all dates and not seeking adjournments when witnesses are present. The court also required Dhaniram to provide a surety bond and to surrender his passport.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Dhaniram was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. While the charges against Dhaniram are serious, the court recognized that bail is a fundamental right and should not be denied unless there are compelling reasons to do so. By imposing certain conditions on Dhaniram's bail, the court sought to ensure that he would appear for trial and that the interests of justice would be served.
