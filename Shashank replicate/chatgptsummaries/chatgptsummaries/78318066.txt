The court is awaiting reports from various laboratories regarding the cause of death of the tiger cubs.

The court order discusses the death of tigers and cubs in Ranthambhore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve. The State Government has taken measures to protect the tigers, including forming a Special Tiger Protection Force and implementing a Tiger Conservation Plan approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority.

The court has received two petitions regarding the issue and is considering further action.
