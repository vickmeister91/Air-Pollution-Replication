The court order in question relates to a revision petition filed by Kanta Devi against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate. The order in question had rejected the petitioner's prayer for recalling witnesses. The judge hearing the revision petition noted that orders of this nature are interlocutory and therefore not revisable. The judge cited previous cases as precedent for this position.

The revision petition was ultimately disposed of, with the petitioner being granted the liberty to file an appropriate petition in the future. This court order highlights the importance of understanding the nature of interlocutory orders and their limitations in terms of being revisable.

Interlocutory orders are those that are made during the course of a legal proceeding and are not final in nature. They are typically made to address procedural matters or to provide temporary relief to one or more parties involved in the case. Examples of interlocutory orders include orders for discovery, orders for the production of documents, and orders for the examination of witnesses.

In the case at hand, the petitioner had sought to have witnesses recalled in order to provide additional evidence in support of her case. The Judicial Magistrate had rejected this request, prompting the petitioner to file a revision petition. However, the judge hearing the revision petition noted that orders of this nature are interlocutory and therefore not revisable.

The judge cited previous cases as precedent for this position. These cases had established that interlocutory orders are not revisable unless they fall within certain limited exceptions. For example, an interlocutory order may be revisable if it is found to be illegal or if it causes irreparable harm to one or more parties involved in the case.

In the case at hand, the judge found that the order rejecting the petitioner's prayer for recalling witnesses did not fall within any of these exceptions. As such, the revision petition was disposed of with the petitioner being granted the liberty to file an appropriate petition in the future.

This court order serves as a reminder of the limitations of revising interlocutory orders. While such orders may be important in the context of a legal proceeding, they are not final in nature and are therefore subject to certain limitations in terms of being revisable. It is important for parties involved in a legal proceeding to understand these limitations and to seek appropriate legal advice when necessary.
