The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Professional Audio and Lighting Association and others against the Union of India and others. The petitioners sought a declaration that there was no prohibition or ban on the use of sound systems/DJ systems in Maharashtra and sought directions to the authorities for proper monitoring of noise pollution. The petitioners also sought directions to the respondents to accept the applications of the members of the petitioners for grant of permission for running the sound systems/DJ systems during the festivals of Ganesh Utsav as well as during Navratri.

The court heard the parties and considered the question of admission of the petition and grant of interim relief. The State of Maharashtra had not yet filed their Affidavit-in-reply. The court granted interim relief by restraining the respondents from taking any coercive action against the members of the society for using DJ systems.

The court order discusses a petition challenging the ban on the use of DJ systems during festive seasons in Maharashtra due to noise pollution. The petitioner argues that the ban is arbitrary and violates their right to earn a livelihood. They also argue that the ban is based on flawed data and that the authorities are unfairly seizing sound systems. The state argues that the ban is necessary to prevent noise pollution and that DJ systems are a major source of noise pollution. The court will need to consider both arguments before making a decision.

The court order discusses the use of loudspeakers and sound systems and the regulations in place to control noise pollution. The court considers various provisions of law, including the Environment (Protection) Act and the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules. The court notes that while there are restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and sound systems, it is difficult to prevent their misuse and identify the real culprits. The court ultimately upholds the regulations in place and emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing noise pollution.

The court order discusses the rules and regulations regarding the use of sound systems, specifically DJ systems, in public places. The court states that the ban on DJ systems is not under Rule 8, which deals with preventive action to prevent annoyance, disturbance, discomfort, or injury to the public or any person. Instead, the ban falls under Rule 5, which requires written permission from the authority to use loudspeakers or public address systems. The court also notes that the ban on DJ systems is not a violation of Article 14 or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, as businesses must operate in conformity with the law. The court declines to grant blanket protection to the petitioners to use DJ systems without specifications and denies their request for interim relief.

The court order clarifies that they have not specifically banned the use of DJ/Dolby music systems, but the law regarding noise pollution rules must be strictly followed. The court cannot form an opinion on the banning of DJ/Dolby systems without reliable material. The petitioners have failed to provide specifications of the systems to demonstrate they can be operated within permissible noise levels. The state government is expected to file a reply, and the court has issued a rule in the petition. Interim relief is rejected.
