The court orders mentioned in this summary all pertain to family law cases involving custody battles and allegations of domestic violence. In the first case, an appeal was filed by Amit Kumar against an order passed by the Ld. Trial Court under the Prevention of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The respondent, Charu Makin, had filed an application under section 12 of the Act, alleging domestic violence by the appellant. The court restrained the appellant from approaching or visiting the respondent's house or workplace and from having any access to their minor child. The appellant filed an application under Section 25 of the Act for modification of the order, which was disposed of by the court. The court recorded a consent order between the parties regarding the custody of their daughter. The appellant filed further applications, and the matter was put for arguments.

In the second case, the appellant no.1 filed various applications under different sections of the Cr.P.C. and Evidence Act in response to a complaint filed by the respondent. The appellant no.1 claimed that the respondent had a habit of picking fights with people and that her behavior was affecting their marriage. He also alleged that she was having an affair with a colleague and that she had lied about her health conditions. The court made various orders regarding the custody of their child and permitted the appellant no.1 to meet his daughter on weekends. The appellant no.1 later filed an application seeking modification of the court's order.

The third case pertains to a custody battle between a father and mother over their minor child. The court modified a previous order to allow the father to meet his daughter on weekends, but declined his request for overnight visitation. The mother argued that the father and his family were poisoning the child's mind against her and that the custody battle was part of a larger dispute over properties. The court noted that the disputes between the parties were no longer limited to custody and that the child's welfare and interests were of paramount consideration.

In the fourth case, the court acknowledged that legal disputes between parents can arise, but it is the duty of parents to protect their child from such disputes. The appellant requested overnight custody of their child, but the respondent argued that the possibility of exposing pending civil litigation and complaints would not be in the best interest of the child. The court ruled that the visitation arrangement of 10am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays should not be interfered with, but the Trial Court can modify the arrangement if deemed necessary for the welfare of the child. The case file is to be sent back to the Trial Court.

In all of these cases, the court's primary concern was the welfare and best interests of the child involved. The court made orders regarding custody and visitation based on the evidence presented and the arguments made by both parties. In some cases, the court allowed modifications to previous orders, while in others, the court declined such requests. The court also acknowledged the impact of legal disputes on children and emphasized the importance of parents protecting their children from such disputes. Overall, the court orders reflect the complexities and challenges of family law cases and the need for careful consideration of all factors involved.
