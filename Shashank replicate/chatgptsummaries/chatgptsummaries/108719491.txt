The first court order pertains to a case filed by Suparna Guha against DDA and another party seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the demolition of a covered area in her flat. The defendants filed applications to reject the plaint, citing various legal provisions. The court considered the arguments of both parties and concluded that the relief sought by the plaintiff cannot be granted due to the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. The court also noted that the plaintiff had already obtained the copy of the sanctioned plan and completion plan from the defendants, rendering the second prayer in the plaint moot.

In the second court order, the plaintiff had instituted a suit for permanent injunction against the defendants who had issued a notice and demolition order in respect of the construction raised by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought a decree of permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from demolishing the covered/constructed area of the suit flat and to issue a direction to the defendant no.1 to provide a copy of sanction plan as well as completion plan to the plaintiff for the satisfaction and clarity of the issue in question. The plaintiff also sought to incorporate additional prayers in the present suit. However, the court allowed the defendant's application under provision of Order VII Rule 11 CPC and rejected the plaint being barred by law.

The third court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff sought to amend their suit to convert their flat to freehold without seeking NOC from the defendant no. 2 society. The defendant no. 2 argued that the amendments sought by the plaintiff were in contravention of certain acts and that the plaintiff was guilty of unauthorized construction. The court dismissed the plaintiff's application for amendment, stating that the reliefs claimed were hit by certain acts and that the plaintiff had other remedies available to them. The defendant's application was allowed and the plaint was rejected.

The fourth court order is not specific enough to be summarized as it only provides the court name, location, and date, along with the title "Order on Application." More information is needed to provide a summary.

In summary, the first court order denied Suparna Guha's request for a permanent injunction to prevent the demolition of a covered area in her flat due to the provisions of Section 31E of the Delhi Development Act. The second court order rejected the plaintiff's suit for permanent injunction against the defendants due to being barred by law. The third court order dismissed the plaintiff's application for amendment to convert their flat to freehold without seeking NOC from the defendant no. 2 society. The fourth court order lacks sufficient information to provide a summary.
