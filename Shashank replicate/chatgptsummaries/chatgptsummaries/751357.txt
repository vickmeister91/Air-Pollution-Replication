The court has directed the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to file responses to these applications within specific time frames. Additionally, the Chief Secretary of the State of Madhya Pradesh has been directed to file a reply.

One of the key aspects of the court order is the modification of the ban on mining activities in the Aravalli hills. The court has issued further directions related to mining in forest areas and areas protected under environmental laws. These directions are aimed at ensuring that mining activities do not cause harm to the environment and are carried out in a sustainable manner.

The court has also directed the CEC to submit a report on the status of mining activities in the Aravalli hills. This report is expected to provide an overview of the current state of mining activities in the region and the impact of these activities on the environment.

In addition to the above, the court has also directed the CEC to examine the issue of illegal mining in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The CEC has been asked to submit a report on the steps taken by the state government to curb illegal mining and the effectiveness of these measures.

The court order also includes directions related to the compensation to be paid to the affected parties. The court has directed the state government to ensure that adequate compensation is paid to those who have been affected by mining activities. This compensation is expected to cover the loss of livelihoods and damage to property caused by mining activities.

Overall, the court order is aimed at ensuring that mining activities are carried out in a sustainable manner and do not cause harm to the environment or the local communities. The court has taken a proactive approach in addressing the issue of illegal mining and has directed the concerned authorities to take appropriate measures to curb this practice.

The matter has been adjourned to a later date, indicating that the court will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary action as required.
