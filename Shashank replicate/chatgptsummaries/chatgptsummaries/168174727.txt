The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by I.H. Sekar under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking to call for records related to the transfer of land in Kancheepuram district and to quash the same. The petitioner also sought direction to restore, protect and preserve the entire extent of "Back Water (Kazhuveli) lands" lying along the sides of Buckingham Canal in the Revenue District of Kancheepuram. The respondents include various government officials and departments. The order was reserved on April 11, 2019, and pronounced on April 29, 2019, by Justice M. Venugopal and Justice S. Vaidyanathan. The order includes a Tamil proverb related to water conservation.

The court order aims to highlight the government's failure to protect water bodies and wetlands and the violation of court judgments on the subject. The petitioner, who is the founder of an environmental protection trust, argued that the transferred lands were classified as "Backwater (Kazhuveli) lands" and were crucial for preventing floods, storing excess water, and recharging wells and ponds. The petitioner argues that the Tamil Nadu Government has a responsibility to protect wetlands and water areas in the state for the benefit of future generations and to prevent environmental damage. The petitioner claims that the government has taken a fallacious stand that Kazhuveli lands do not come under the category of wetlands and marshlands and therefore do not enjoy any protection against reclassification, alienation, or transfers for alternate uses. The petitioner also argues that the government has violated court orders by passing impugned orders that allow for construction and alienation of wetlands and marshlands. The petitioner claims that the government's actions violate Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which recognizes the right to water as a part of the right to life. The third respondent counters that the NGT has already dealt with the issue and held that the disputed land in question is not a water body or marshland and that the land transferred to the transport department is for public purpose and construction.

The court order states that the State is allowed to use the land for constructing structures for the transport department, as long as it does not cause any environmental or ecological problems. The order also mentions that the NGT has already made a finding that the lands are not marsh lands or water bodies. The petitioner argues that the NGT's decision does not constitute a legal bar against their writ petition, as the issues are different. The court also cites a previous judgment that simultaneous proceedings under NGT Act and writ petition are distinct and different in their scope and relief.

The court order states that the proceedings in question are not substantially or materially identical, and that the objection raised by the respondent does not satisfy the requirements for res judicata or constructive res judicata. The petitioner argues that this view is supported by various judgments from high courts and different benches of the NGT. The NGT had previously adjudicated on the issue of non-serious environmental problems arising from the construction of structures by the 5th respondent in 7 acres of land, leaving the determination of the nature of the remaining lands to the State Level Wetland Authority. The petitioner argues that the NGT cannot determine the validity of the transfer of wetlands by the state authorities, which come under the ambit of Public Trust Doctrine. The transfer of Kazhuveli lands is also argued to be violative of the principle of Public Trust Doctrine and the responsibilities of the state in protecting natural and communal properties. The court cites the ancient Roman Empire's Doctrine of the Public Trust and the English common law's concept of the Crown holding resources in trust for the benefit of the public.

The court order discusses the history of public trust law and emphasizes the importance of certain resources, such as air, sea, waters, and forests, being freely available to everyone and protected by the government for the enjoyment of the general public. The order also provides directions for the Tamil Nadu government to follow in protecting water resources and preventing encroachment on tank poramboke lands. The court upholds the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act, while also ensuring that principles of natural justice are observed within the Act itself.

The court order discusses a dispute over land classification in Tamil Nadu, India. The petitioner argues that certain lands classified as Kazhuveli lands must be protected and any buildings on them removed, while the respondent argues that the lands are unobjectionable and suitable for assignment. The court cites previous judgments and laws to support both arguments. The court also notes that any objections to the land classification must be considered and appropriate orders passed. The respondent argues that environmental issues should be litigated before the National Green Tribunal rather than the High Court.

The court order states that the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition regarding the transfer of land for public offices. The petitioner had already raised the issue before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and therefore cannot re-agitate the same issue before the court. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has no concern with the issue, and it is up to the state government to take necessary action. The court also discusses the limited scope of power of the NGT and the principle of res judicata.

The court order outlines the establishment of administrative tribunals for the Union and each state, specifying their jurisdiction, powers, and
