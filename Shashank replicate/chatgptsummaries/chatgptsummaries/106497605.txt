The court order in question pertains to a case where an objection was raised regarding the maintainability of a petition against an order passed by the Third ASJ rejecting an application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. The objector argued that the order was an interlocutory order and therefore not revisable under Section 397 (2) of Cr.P.C. The petitioner, on the other hand, argued that the order was not interlocutory and cited previous cases to support their argument.

The court, after hearing both sides, dismissed the objection and directed the parties to address the court on the merits of the case. This decision was based on the interpretation of Section 397 (2) of Cr.P.C., which states that an order passed in any inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, shall be deemed to be interlocutory if it is passed before the judgment is pronounced.

In this case, the order passed by the Third ASJ rejecting the application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. was passed before the judgment was pronounced. However, the petitioner argued that the order was not interlocutory as it finally determined the rights of the parties with respect to the application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, held that the order passed by the Third ASJ was indeed interlocutory in nature. The court relied on previous cases where it was held that an order is interlocutory if it does not finally determine the rights of the parties. In this case, the order passed by the Third ASJ did not finally determine the rights of the parties as it was passed before the judgment was pronounced.

The court also noted that the objector had not raised any other ground for challenging the maintainability of the petition. Therefore, the court dismissed the objection and directed the parties to address the court on the merits of the case.

This court order highlights the importance of understanding the nature of an order passed in a criminal proceeding. It also emphasizes the need for parties to raise all relevant grounds for challenging the maintainability of a petition. In this case, the objector's argument was based solely on the interpretation of Section 397 (2) of Cr.P.C., which was ultimately rejected by the court.
