The Madras High Court recently heard a Civil Revision Petition filed by M/s. Amman Oil Mill and Refineries against M. Saradhambal and others. The respondents had filed a suit against the petitioners to cancel their license and prevent them from running the oil mill. The petitioners argued that the suit was barred under Section 9 of the C.P.C in view of Section 46 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 58 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court considered the arguments and documents presented and decided to strike the plaint in O.S.No.11 of 2014 pending on the file of the District Munsif Court, Kangeyam.

The court order pertains to the Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court order states that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which an Appellate Authority constituted under these Acts is empowered to determine. The court also refers to a previous case where it was stated that the purpose of these Acts is to ensure pollution-free water, air, and environment, and the jurisdiction of civil courts has been taken away to prevent delay in reaching a logical conclusion. The court warns that entertaining suits against Pollution Control Boards and authorities will prove fatal to people and defeat the aims and objectives of the Acts.

The court order directs that civil courts must follow the provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and Environment Act. Any suits related to these enactments must be taken up within two weeks and disposed of accordingly. The jurisdiction of civil courts is ousted only if a statutory remedy is available under the special enactments mentioned. The special dispensation under these enactments is not intended to redress civil and criminal disputes arising from any breach of the laws. The court also discusses the application of Section 133 of the Cr.P.Code in preventing public nuisance and the urgency involved in taking immediate action.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of civil courts in cases related to pollution control acts. It states that civil courts have jurisdiction to consider matters that have not been appealed against, and that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 has been enacted to establish separate environmental courts. Under this law, the jurisdiction of civil courts is ousted, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment is involved. The Tribunal shall hear and settle disputes arising from such questions. The order also cites a Law Commission report that recommended the establishment of Environmental Courts to deal with complex scientific and specialized issues relating to the environment.

The court order outlines the powers and responsibilities of the National Green Tribunal, including the ability to provide relief, compensation, and restitution for victims of pollution and environmental damage. Applications for such relief must be made within five years of the cause for compensation or relief first arising, but the Tribunal may allow for a further period of up to sixty days if the applicant was prevented from filing within the initial period. The Tribunal also has appellate jurisdiction over certain orders and decisions made by other authorities related to environmental protection.

The court order pertains to the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which grants environmental clearance subject to certain safeguards. The order states that any appeal against an order or decision made by the National Biodiversity Authority or a State Biodiversity Board must be made within 30 days. The Act also bars civil courts from entertaining appeals in matters that fall under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The court concludes that a civil suit is barred in light of the provisions of the National Green Tribunals Act, 2010. The Present Civil Revision Petition is allowed and no cost is imposed.

In summary, the Madras High Court has clarified the jurisdiction of civil courts in cases related to pollution control acts. The court has stated that civil courts have jurisdiction to consider matters that have not been appealed against, but the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 has been enacted to establish separate environmental courts. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment is involved. The court has also outlined the powers and responsibilities of the National Green Tribunal, including the ability to provide relief, compensation, and restitution for victims of pollution and environmental damage. The court has warned that entertaining suits against Pollution Control Boards and authorities will prove fatal to people and defeat the aims and objectives of the Acts. The court has directed that civil courts must follow the provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and Environment Act and any suits related to these enactments must be taken up within two weeks and disposed of accordingly.
