The court has granted bail to Rajveer @ Ramveer, who has been in custody since January 28, 2017, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act. The applicant's counsel argued that he is a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that his presence is no longer required during the investigation. The court accepted the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and granted bail on the ground of parity with a personal bond of Rs. 35,000 and a surety bond of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial but becomes ineffective in case of bail jump.

The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act are two important pieces of legislation in India that aim to protect the country's wildlife and forests. The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Indian Forest Act, on the other hand, was enacted in 1927 to consolidate the law relating to forests, the transit of forest produce, and the duty leviable on timber and other forest produce.

Rajveer @ Ramveer was arrested for offences under these two Acts, which suggests that he may have been involved in activities that are detrimental to the environment. However, his counsel argued that he is a reputed citizen with no criminal past, which implies that he may have been falsely implicated in the case. The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both sides, decided to grant him bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rajveer @ Ramveer is based on the principle of parity, which means that he should be treated in the same way as other accused persons who have been granted bail in similar cases. This principle is important in ensuring that the justice system is fair and impartial and that no one is discriminated against on the basis of their social status or other factors.

The court has imposed certain conditions on Rajveer @ Ramveer as part of the bail order. He has to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 35,000 and a surety bond of the same amount. He also has to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings. If he fails to comply with any of these conditions, the bail order will become ineffective, and he will be taken back into custody.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rajveer @ Ramveer is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting the environment and the need to punish those who engage in activities that harm it. The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act are crucial pieces of legislation that help in achieving this objective. However, it is also important to ensure that the justice system is fair and impartial and that no one is falsely implicated in cases related to environmental offences.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Rajveer @ Ramveer is based on the principle of parity and the fact that his presence is no longer required during the investigation. The conditions imposed on him as part of the bail order are aimed at ensuring that he cooperates with the investigation and attends all court hearings. The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act are important pieces of legislation that aim to protect the environment, and it is important to ensure that the justice system is fair and impartial in cases related to environmental offences.
