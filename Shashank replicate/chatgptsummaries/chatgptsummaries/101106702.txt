The court order pertains to nine appeals made by different stone crushing businesses in Haryana, challenging the legality of an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in 2012. The businesses argue that they had obtained necessary permissions and had not violated any guidelines. The court examines the facts of each case and ultimately dismisses the appeals, upholding the HSPCB's order.

In one of the cases, the appellant claims that frivolous suits were filed against their stone crusher in 2007, but were withdrawn before the High Court. In 2012, a show cause notice was issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) stating that the unit was running in violation of the notification dated 18th December, 1997 and the consent had been granted under a misconception of facts. The appellant submitted a reply denying any violation, but the HSPCB issued another show cause notice stating that the consent application was incomplete. The appellant submitted a reply to this notice as well, but the HSPCB refused to grant consent to the appellant in their order dated 15th March, 2012.

The court order pertains to the refusal of consent for the year 2011-12 under Section 21/22 of Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to M/s. Jai Mata Di Stone Crusher. The order states that the unit failed to comply with various provisions of the Air Act 1981 and the sitting parameters of the Notification dated 18.12.1997. The order also mentions that the unit did not submit the operation schedule of the stone crusher, analysis report under Air Act, 1981, and did not meet the sitting parameters as per the notification dated 18.12.1997. The court upholds the order of the HSPCB and dismisses the appeals filed by the appellants.

The court order states that stone crushers emit harmful dust and noise that can cause respiratory diseases and hearing impairment in workers and nearby residents. The court also notes that the stone crushers violate protective measures and anti-pollution devices required by law. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting human health over private business interests. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and limitations of the National Green Tribunal Act in relation to appeals being barred by time.

The court order states that the Tribunal cannot be given the power to condone delays beyond 90 days as it goes against the legislative intent and language of the Section. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board Vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission case is cited to support this. The court also discusses the interpretation of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the Central Excise Act, 1944, and how they exclude the operation of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The court concludes that even if a special law does not expressly exclude the provisions of the Limitation Act, the court can examine whether the nature of the provisions or the subject matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and the use of negative language in statutes to make provisions mandatory. The court holds that Section 5 of the Limitation Act cannot be invoked for entertaining an appeal filed beyond the period specified in the special law. The court also states that once negative language is used in a provision, the application of provisions of the Limitation Act or such analogous provisions would not be applicable. The court dismisses all appeals filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation and leaves the parties to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to nine appeals made by different stone crushing businesses in Haryana, challenging the legality of an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in 2012. The court examines the facts of each case and ultimately dismisses the appeals, upholding the HSPCB's order. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and limitations of the National Green Tribunal Act in relation to appeals being barred by time and the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting human health over private business interests and dismisses all appeals filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
