The Gujarat High Court recently reviewed a complaint filed by the Assistant Environmental Engineer on behalf of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against a private limited company and its co-directors for producing Nicotine Sulphate in their factory and discharging polluted water. The court found that the complaint was not filed by a person authorized by the Board, as required by Section 49(1)(a) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. As a result, the court declared the entire trial and exercise in appeal illegal.

The court order states that the trial and appeal in a case were illegal due to an improperly filed complaint by an unauthorized person. The court also found that there was no evidence to prove that one of the accused was in charge of the company and responsible for the conduct of its business, and therefore, could not be convicted. Additionally, the court found that there was a breach of Section 21(5) of the Act, as there was a delay in sending a sample for analysis, which could vitiate the prosecution. As a result, the court allowed the revision and acquitted the accused.

The case in question involved a private limited company and its co-directors who were accused of producing Nicotine Sulphate in their factory and discharging polluted water. The Assistant Environmental Engineer had filed a complaint on behalf of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the accused. However, the court found that the complaint was not filed by a person authorized by the Board, as required by Section 49(1)(a) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This section requires that any complaint filed under the Act must be filed by a person authorized by the Board. Since the complaint was not filed by an authorized person, the court declared the entire trial and exercise in appeal illegal.

In addition to the issue of the improperly filed complaint, the court also found that there was no evidence to prove that one of the accused was in charge of the company and responsible for the conduct of its business. This is a requirement under Section 17 of the Act, which states that any person who is in charge of a company and responsible for the conduct of its business can be held liable for any offence committed by the company. Since there was no evidence to prove that the accused was in charge of the company, the court held that he could not be convicted.

Furthermore, the court found that there was a breach of Section 21(5) of the Act, which requires that any sample taken for analysis must be sent to the laboratory within a specified time period. In this case, there was a delay in sending the sample for analysis, which could vitiate the prosecution. As a result, the court allowed the revision and acquitted the accused.

Overall, the court found that the trial and exercise in appeal were illegal due to the improperly filed complaint by an unauthorized person. In addition, the court found that there was no evidence to prove that one of the accused was in charge of the company and responsible for the conduct of its business, and that there was a breach of Section 21(5) of the Act. As a result, the court allowed the revision and acquitted the accused. This case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and requirements under the law, and the consequences of failing to do so.
