Mahesh Dwivedi had filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the learned JMFC, Bhopal, in Criminal Case No.2601062/2015 and an order passed by the learned 19th ASJ, Bhopal in Criminal Revision No.66/18. The petitioner/accused had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to direct the complainant to produce a challan, but the application was dismissed by the trial court. The Revisional Court also dismissed the revision. The petitioner/accused argued that the trial court erred in accepting the defence of the respondent and that the challan was required as it is a material bearing on the issue involved in the case. However, the respondent/complainant stated that he had no such challan, and the court dismissed the petition.

The case in question pertains to a petition filed by Mahesh Dwivedi, who was the accused in Criminal Case No.2601062/2015. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to direct the complainant to produce a challan. However, the trial court dismissed the application, and the Revisional Court also dismissed the revision. The petitioner argued that the trial court erred in accepting the defence of the respondent and that the challan was required as it is a material bearing on the issue involved in the case.

The petitioner contended that the trial court had erred in accepting the defence of the respondent, who had claimed that he had no such challan. The petitioner argued that the challan was required as it is a material bearing on the issue involved in the case. The petitioner further contended that the trial court had failed to appreciate the fact that the challan was an important document that could have a significant impact on the outcome of the case.

The respondent, on the other hand, stated that he had no such challan and that the petitioner was merely trying to delay the proceedings. The respondent argued that the petitioner was trying to use the challan as a means to escape liability for the offence he had committed.

The court, after hearing both sides, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that the challan was required for the case. The court further observed that the petitioner had not been able to establish that the challan was a material document that could have a significant impact on the outcome of the case.

The court also noted that the respondent had categorically stated that he had no such challan, and the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to contradict this claim. The court, therefore, concluded that the petitioner's claim that the challan was required for the case was baseless and without merit.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the learned JMFC, Bhopal, in Criminal Case No.2601062/2015 and an order passed by the learned 19th ASJ, Bhopal in Criminal Revision No.66/18. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that the challan was required for the case and that the respondent had categorically stated that he had no such challan. The court, therefore, concluded that the petitioner's claim was baseless and without merit.
