The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by C. Rathinavel against the State of Tamil Nadu, the Wildlife Warden, the Ranger, and the Superintendent of Police. The petitioner claimed to be a manufacturer of Lime Powder and used coral reef as one of the raw materials. The Wildlife Warden had stopped the petitioner from collecting coral reef, and the petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to prevent interference with the collection, storage, transportation, and use of coral reef.

The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the coral reef comes under the definition of "animal article" and is protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court also noted that the petitioner's earlier writ petition on the same issue was still pending.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act defines "animal article" as any article made from any captive or wild animal, and includes an article or object in which the whole or any part of such animal has been used, and ivory imported into India whether raw or worked.

The court's decision was based on the fact that coral reef is a living organism and therefore comes under the definition of "animal article" as per the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act provides for the protection of all wild animals, including coral reefs, and prohibits their hunting, killing, or capturing. The Act also prohibits the trade in animal articles without a license.

The court's decision is in line with the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which seeks to protect all wild animals and plants, including coral reefs. The Act recognizes the importance of conserving and protecting the natural habitats of wild animals and plants, and seeks to regulate their trade and commerce.

The court's decision also highlights the need for manufacturers and businesses to be aware of the laws and regulations governing the use of natural resources. The use of coral reef as a raw material may have been a common practice for the petitioner, but it was not in compliance with the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court's decision also serves as a reminder of the importance of sustainable development and the need to balance economic growth with environmental protection. The use of natural resources must be done in a responsible and sustainable manner, taking into account the long-term impact on the environment and the need to conserve and protect natural habitats.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the writ petition filed by C. Rathinavel against the State of Tamil Nadu, the Wildlife Warden, the Ranger, and the Superintendent of Police, highlights the need for businesses and manufacturers to be aware of the laws and regulations governing the use of natural resources. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for the protection of all wild animals and plants, including coral reefs, and seeks to regulate their trade and commerce. The court's decision is in line with the provisions of the Act and serves as a reminder of the importance of sustainable development and environmental protection.
