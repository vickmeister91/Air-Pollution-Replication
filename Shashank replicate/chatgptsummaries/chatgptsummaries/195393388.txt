The court orders mentioned in this summary pertain to various cases related to environmental impact assessments, pollution control, and construction projects in different parts of India. In one case, between Windsor Realty Pvt. Ltd and various government bodies and individuals, the details of the case are not provided in the summary. In another case, the court lists the parties involved in a series of writ petitions and appeals related to environmental impact assessments and pollution control in the state of Maharashtra. The respondents include government agencies, a construction company, and individuals.

In a third case, the court lists the parties involved in two connected writ petitions. The first petition involves Ree Balaji Concepts, a partnership firm, and Mrs. Radha Satish Timblo, the wife of a late partner. The respondents include the State of Goa, Cavelossim Villagers Forum, Village Panchayat of Cavelossim, Senior Town Planner, The Collector, Assistant Engineer-Sub Division, Water Resource Department, Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, Goa State Pollution Control Board, and Goa State Biodiversity Board. The second petition involves Mrs. Anamika Amerkar and Shri Gurudas Amerkar, Indian nationals, and the respondents include Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, State of Goa, and Judith Almeida.

In another case, a group of writ petitions challenging a judgment and order passed by the National Green Tribunal are being heard. The petitioners are real estate developers who have developed a plot of land in Goa. The respondents include various government bodies and authorities. The court has de-tagged one of the petitions and will hear it separately. The court has heard all the petitions and has reserved its judgment.

In a case involving the construction of a commercial and residential building in Goregaon, Mumbai, the petitioner had obtained necessary approvals and had commenced construction in compliance with the amended plans approved by the Planning Authority. However, an application was filed by Respondent No.2 seeking certain reliefs under Section 14 read with Section 15 and 18 of the said Act. The NGT dismissed the Petitioner's Misc. Application No.65 of 2014, holding that the Application filed by Respondent No.2 was within limitation and that Respondent No.2 had locus to file the application before the Tribunal. The court held that a writ petition challenging the order of NGT is maintainable before Division Bench of the High Court. The court also held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to file an appeal, but the objection was without any substance.

In another case, a group of writ petitions raise important questions about the powers and limitations of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in protecting environmental rights. The court has appointed a senior counsel as an Amicus Curiae to assist in the matter. The court is considering the conflicting interests of citizens who want to ensure compliance with environmental laws and developers who have already completed projects and do not want to be harassed by belated applications. The court is also examining the interpretation of the peculiar wording of Section 14 of the NGT Act, which deals with the period of limitation for filing applications. The court is trying to reconcile these conflicting interests and lay down proper law in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

In the final case, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) brushed aside two judgments of the Coordinate Bench without giving reasons. The court found that the view taken by NGT Bench, Pune that the cause of action would arise from the date of knowledge of the original applicant about the alleged violation and secondly from the date on which Environmental Authorities do not take any action after violation is brought to their notice is not in accordance with law. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the Tribunal to decide afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The NGT was directed to decide all the issues within a period of three months.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of environmental impact assessments, pollution control, and compliance with environmental laws in India. The courts are trying to balance the interests of developers and citizens while ensuring that the environment is protected. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) plays a crucial role in this process, and the courts are examining its powers and limitations to ensure that it functions in accordance with the law.
