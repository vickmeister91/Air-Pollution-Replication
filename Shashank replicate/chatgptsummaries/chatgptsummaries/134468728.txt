The case of Chotu Gurjar, who filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.2, Bari District Dholpur, has been resolved. The petitioner's tractor and trolley were seized as case property, and the petitioner's counsel argued that the vehicles were registered in his name and no confiscation proceedings were pending. The State's Public Prosecutor argued that confiscation proceedings had to commence before the vehicles could be released. 

After hearing both sides, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, seized as case property, with certain conditions. The trial court was also directed to verify that the petitioner was the registered owner of the vehicles. This decision was made in accordance with the law, which states that confiscation proceedings must be initiated before property can be seized. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner was the registered owner of the vehicles and that no confiscation proceedings were pending. The court also took into account the fact that the vehicles were necessary for the petitioner's livelihood. The court's decision was fair and just, as it allowed the petitioner to continue his work without any hindrance. 

This case highlights the importance of following due process of law when it comes to the seizure of property. Confiscation proceedings must be initiated before property can be seized, and the registered owner of the property must be given the opportunity to defend their ownership. The court's decision in this case was a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of citizens. 

In conclusion, the court's decision to release the petitioner's tractor and trolley was a just and fair one. The court followed due process of law and ensured that the petitioner's rights were protected. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of citizens.
