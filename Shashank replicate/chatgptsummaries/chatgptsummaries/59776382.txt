The petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions subject to which the land was given to it. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh upheld the order of the learned Single Judge. The land stands resumed by the State of Haryana and re-vested in the Gram Panchayat. Mutation has also been sanctioned in favour of the Gram Panchayat, and the land is to be used for the benefit of the villagers.

In another court order, a petitioner had taken over public land for the purpose of advancing education but failed to act as per the agreement and put forward a false plea of lack of funds. The court found that the petitioner had a track record of advancing individual interest at the cost of the village and that public interest would not be advanced by interference on a mere offer to serve poor children. The court also found that forest land was acquired without the requisite permission and that the land had to be utilized by the competent authority in a transparent manner as per applicable policy and law. The special leave petitions were dismissed.
