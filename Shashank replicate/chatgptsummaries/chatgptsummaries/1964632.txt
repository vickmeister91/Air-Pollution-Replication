Three court orders are summarized below, each pertaining to a claim for compensation under different Acts. The first order deals with an appeal under the Indian Railways Act, 1890, where the appellants sought compensation for the death of their family member who drowned after a collision between a steamer and a jetty. The court had to determine whether the deceased could be considered a passenger on the steamer and whether the jetty could be considered a part of the steamer. The court held that the steamer could be considered a railway under the Act and that the jetty could be considered a part of the steamer. Therefore, the deceased could be considered a passenger on the steamer, and the appellants were entitled to compensation under the Act.

In the second court order, a representative of a deceased workman brought an action for compensation against his employers under the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, after a wagon broke away and killed him. The only point of contention was whether the driver or fireman had control of the train at the time of the accident. The court rejected the argument that a stationary jetty could be considered part of a steamer carrying passengers, and therefore the dependents of the deceased were not entitled to claim compensation under the Act. The court also clarified that in order to claim compensation under Section 82-A of the Act, the deceased must have been a passenger in the train carrying passengers that met with the accident. This interpretation was supported by the Railway Accidents (Compensation) Rules, 1950.

The third court order states that Rule 11 (i) requires the person claiming compensation to have been a passenger on the train that met with the accident. The argument that this rule is ultra vires is dismissed as the rules were made under the Act and are to be treated as if they were in the Act. Section 82-A of the Act also requires the person in respect of whom compensation is claimed to have been a passenger on the train. Therefore, Rule 11 (i) is not inconsistent with Section 82-A of the Act. The court concludes that the appellants are not entitled to claim compensation under Section 82-A of the Act as the deceased was not a passenger on the steamer that met with the accident. However, the court recommends that the Railway Administration pays a compensation of at least Rs. 1,000/- to the appellants out of humanitarian considerations and sympathy for the family of the deceased.

This decision was based on the interpretation of the Act and the facts of the case.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the Act and the rules made under it.

In all three court orders, the decisions were based on the interpretation of the relevant Acts and the facts of the cases. The courts had to determine whether the claimants were entitled to compensation under the Acts and the rules made under them. The courts also considered humanitarian considerations and sympathy for the families of the deceased in making their decisions. These court orders demonstrate the importance of understanding the Acts and rules that govern claims for compensation and the need for a fair and just interpretation of them.
