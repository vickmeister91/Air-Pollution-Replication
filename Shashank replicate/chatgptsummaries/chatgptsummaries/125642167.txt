The court order in question pertains to a case where M/s. Sakthivel & Co. had filed two criminal original petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside the order dated 2.9.2015 made in C.M.P.No.5625 of 2015 in C.C.No.66 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track Court No.1, Erode. The case involved the accused borrowing a sum of Rs.10 lakhs from the complainant and giving a cheque dated 20.12.2012 for Rs.10 lakhs, which was returned unpaid for insufficiency of funds. The complainant issued a statutory notice under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and since the accused did not comply with the demand, a complaint was filed.

The accused filed Cr.M.P.Nos.5624 and 5625 of 2015 under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. respectively to produce 256 self-cheques that were allegedly passed by the accused's bank and also to recall the Bank Manager for the purpose of marking those cheques. The trial Court dismissed both the petitions, and the accused filed the criminal original petitions. The court dismissed both the Criminal Original Petitions as they were devoid of merits.

The case involved the interpretation of Section 91 and 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in issue.

The accused had sought to produce 256 self-cheques allegedly passed by the accused's bank and to recall the Bank Manager for the purpose of marking those cheques. The trial court had dismissed both the petitions, and the accused had filed the criminal original petitions to set aside the order. The court, however, dismissed both the Criminal Original Petitions as they were devoid of merits.

The court held that the accused had failed to make out a case for the production of the self-cheques. The court noted that the accused had not produced any evidence to show that the self-cheques were relevant to the case or that they would throw any light on the matter in issue. The court also held that the accused had failed to make out a case for the recall of the Bank Manager. The court noted that the accused had not shown how the Bank Manager's testimony would be relevant to the case or how it would throw any light on the matter in issue.

The court further held that the accused had not made out a case for the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that the accused had not shown that the order passed by the trial court was either illegal or unjustified or that it had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The court observed that the accused had merely sought to delay the proceedings by filing the criminal original petitions.
