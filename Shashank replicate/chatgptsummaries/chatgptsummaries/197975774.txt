The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the development of land within the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone in Gujarat, India, and the requirement for environmental clearance for such development. The petitioners in each case argue that the development is in violation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, and that the government and its authorities have failed to prevent illegal construction.

In the first case, the respondents (numbers 10 and 11) have allegedly started construction without prior environmental clearance. The court order does not provide a final decision on the matter. In the second case, the respondents argue that the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, does not apply to their project, as they have received necessary approvals and permissions from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Development Commissioner. The petitioners argue that the unit in question falls within Item No.5(k), which requires prior environmental clearance. The court is yet to issue an appropriate writ, order, or direction in the matter.

The third case involves a proposed manufacturing unit within the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone (MPSEZ) without an environmental clearance certificate. The court examines the arguments of the petitioners, respondent no. 8 (MPSEZ), respondent nos. 10 and 11, and the Union of India, and ultimately determines that the proposed manufacturing unit does not require an environmental clearance certificate, as confirmed by a letter from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court does not address the question of whether the MPSEZ itself needs to obtain clearance before other units can proceed with construction.

In the fourth case, the court concludes that only projects involving furnaces with a capacity of more than 30,000 tonnes per annum require environmental clearance. The court also states that the MPSEZ cannot proceed with construction without obtaining environmental clearance. The court emphasizes the mandatory nature of environmental clearance and the prohibition on any construction work until clearance is obtained. The court also questions the idea that individual allottees would have to provide infrastructural facilities if the MPSEZ is unable to obtain environmental clearance.

The fifth case states that the MPSEZ has not been granted environmental clearance for the development of a port on 18000 hectares of land, which includes 14 villages. The MPSEZ is obligated to provide infrastructural facilities, but if environmental clearance is not granted, it is unclear who will develop the port and provide the necessary facilities. The court has ordered that individual allottees cannot proceed with construction until the MPSEZ obtains environmental clearance. The court also notes serious objections raised during public hearings regarding the impact on the environment and local communities.

The final case pertains to a lease deed for a land in Mundra SEZ, which includes maintenance charges for infrastructural facilities provided to the land. The Lessor is responsible for complying with all terms and conditions mentioned in the Letter of Approval and obtaining all required permissions and governmental approvals. The Lessee cannot have better rights than the Lessor in the property, and there cannot be a valid lease for enjoyment of a property that is not in existence or capable of being put into possession of the Lessee at the time of execution of the lease. The court has not gone into the question of whether the respondent is entitled to get environmental clearance. The request for a stay of operation of the order has been rejected.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of obtaining environmental clearance before proceeding with any development within the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone. The court emphasizes the mandatory nature of environmental clearance and the prohibition on any construction work until clearance is obtained. The court also notes serious objections raised during public hearings regarding the impact on the environment and local communities. It remains to be seen how these cases will be resolved and what impact they will have on future development within the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone.
