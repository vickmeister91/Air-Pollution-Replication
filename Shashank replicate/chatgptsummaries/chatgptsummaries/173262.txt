The Patna High Court recently disposed of two cases involving Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and the State of Bihar. The first case involved Larsen & Toubro Ltd., which had secured a turn-key contract from Indian Oil Corporation Limited and was registered as a dealer in commercial tax. The company claimed that the demands made by the taxing officer were illegal and contrary to law. The court heard arguments about the follow-up legislation to Section 21(1)(a)(i) of the Bihar Finance Act, which prescribes the "manner and extent of deduction." The court also discussed the definition of "works contract" and "gross turnover" under the Bihar Finance Act. The court ultimately reserved judgment on the matter.

The second case discussed the taxation of works contracts and the deductions that can be made from the taxable turnover of a dealer. The Supreme Court has ruled that the value of the goods involved in the execution of a works contract on which tax is leviable must exclude charges for supply of labour and services, and that the value of goods involved in the execution of a works contract will have to be determined after deducting the value of those goods which are not taxable. The court also found that certain provisions in the Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules and Bihar Finance Act were unconstitutional and void.

The third court order discusses the issue of deductions in relation to any other charges in the Bihar Sales Tax Act. The court finds that while the Act provides for deductions in relation to labour charges, it does not prescribe the manner and extent of deductions in relation to any other charges. The court also notes that Rule 13A of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules, 1983 does not provide for deductions in relation to any other charges. The court concludes that the State Legislature is obliged to prescribe the manner and extent of deductions in relation to any other charges, and that failure to do so renders the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules unconstitutional.

The fourth court order states that the State government must prescribe the manner and extent of deduction for works contracts, and cannot simply provide the manner and extent relating to labor charges and go into hibernation. The court also notes that the assessing officer did not act fairly in passing the order of assessment and that the assessment orders cannot be allowed to stand. The liability of the dealer will continue, but recovery proceedings cannot be initiated against the petitioners nor any coercive action taken against them. The court also observes that during the pendency of the case, second assessment proceedings started, and the assessing officer proceeded ex parte, assessed the petitioner, and decided the artificial liability of the petitioner. The court quashes the assessment orders and allows both petitions, with no order as to costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed the issue of deductions in relation to works contracts and other charges under the Bihar Sales Tax Act. The court found that the State Legislature is obliged to prescribe the manner and extent of deductions in relation to any other charges, and that failure to do so renders the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules unconstitutional. The court also noted that the assessing officer did not act fairly in passing the order of assessment and that the assessment orders cannot be allowed to stand. The liability of the dealer will continue, but recovery proceedings cannot be initiated against the petitioners nor any coercive action taken against them.
