A recent court order has been issued in relation to a dispute over the allotment of an elephant named Thrikadavoor Sivaraju for a temple festival. The petitioner had applied for the elephant's allotment, but the Devaswom Board had decided to allot it to a person of their choice, which the petitioner challenged as arbitrary. The court directed the Devaswom Board to conduct a transparent exercise to identify the person to whom the elephant would be allotted, either by auction or drawing lots.

The court's decision to direct the Devaswom Board to conduct a transparent exercise to identify the person to whom the elephant would be allotted is also significant.
