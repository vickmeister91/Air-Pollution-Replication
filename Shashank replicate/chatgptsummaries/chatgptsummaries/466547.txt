The All India Skin and Hide Tanners & Merchants Association filed a writ petition to quash an award and report passed by The Loss of Ecology (Prevention and Payment of Compensation) Authority for Vellore district. The Authority was constituted by the Government of India to deal with the situation created by tanneries and other polluting industries in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner argued that the subsequent award passed in 2009 was without jurisdiction and that the polluters' liability was an absolute liability. 

The court rejected these arguments and held that the polluter's liability continues until the ecological damage caused by them is restored. The court also rejected the argument that the report and award were in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court order rejects the contention that the polluter is not liable for ecological damage caused by them until the damage is restored. The court finds no merit in the argument that the samples taken in 2009 cannot determine the condition of 1991-1998. 

The court upholds the report and award passed by the Loss of Ecology Authority and dismisses the writ petition. The court also rejects the argument that the report and award violate natural justice by depriving the petitioner of their right to cross-examine the study team. 

The case highlights the importance of holding polluters accountable for the ecological damage caused by them. The court's decision reinforces the principle of absolute liability, which holds that polluters are responsible for the damage caused by their activities, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. This principle is crucial in ensuring that polluters take adequate measures to prevent environmental damage and compensate for any harm caused.

The court's rejection of the argument that the report and award violate natural justice is also significant. Natural justice is a fundamental principle of law that requires fair and impartial decision-making. The court's decision affirms that the Loss of Ecology Authority followed due process in arriving at its decision and that the petitioner was not deprived of their right to a fair hearing.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of scientific evidence in environmental cases. The court found no merit in the argument that the samples taken in 2009 could not determine the condition of 1991-1998. This highlights the need for accurate and reliable scientific data to assess the extent of environmental damage and determine the appropriate compensation.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a significant step towards holding polluters accountable for their actions and ensuring that they take adequate measures to prevent environmental damage. The court's affirmation of the principle of absolute liability and its rejection of the argument that the report and award violate natural justice are important precedents that will guide future environmental cases. The case also highlights the importance of scientific evidence in environmental cases and the need for accurate and reliable data to assess the extent of environmental damage.
