The court order pertains to a case of eviction of a tenant under Section 14 (1)(e) read with Section 25B of Delhi Rent Control Act. The petitioner, who is a government-approved valuer, seeks to start a business in the suit shop due to financial constraints and the need for more space. The respondent, who is the tenant, has filed an application for leave to defend, stating that he is not the tenant under the petitioner but Delco Laboratories is a tenant under the petitioner. However, the court finds that the relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted between the parties, and the respondent is the proprietor of Delco Laboratories and the tenant under the petitioner.

The court also finds that the petitioner, being a co-owner, can maintain the eviction petition, and the fact that all co-owners are not required to be impleaded in an eviction petition. The court further finds that the accommodation situated at the ground floor is more suited for business/work purposes, and the petitioner has the right to start his business in premises more suitable and convenient to him.

The court order states that the petitioner, who is the landlord, is entitled to an order of eviction under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. The respondent's plea for alternate accommodation is not tenable as the two rooms on the first floor are not equally suitable. The respondent has not raised any triable issue, and the facts are admitted between the parties. The petitioner's need for a separate space for running his business is explained and not malafide. The respondent's application seeking leave to defend is dismissed, and an order of eviction is passed in favor of the petitioner. However, the petitioner cannot obtain possession before six months from the date of the order.
