The court order in question pertains to two petitions, W.P.(PIL) No.445 of 2013 and W.P.(PIL) No.2467 of 2013. The former petition concerns a request for NOC (No Objection Certificate) under section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, which has been sent to the Ministry of Environment & Forest (Government of India). The latter petition will be taken up along with the former on the next date of hearing, which is scheduled for 11.05.2015.

The court has granted two weeks' time for the respondent to place on record the response of the Ministry of Environment & Forest. This indicates that the court is taking a serious view of the matter and wants to ensure that all relevant information is available before making a decision.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a central legislation that regulates diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act requires that any proposal for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes must be accompanied by an NOC from the Ministry of Environment & Forest. The Act also provides for penalties for violation of its provisions.

The petitioners in W.P.(PIL) No.445 of 2013 have sought an NOC for diversion of forest land for a mining project. The petitioners have argued that the project is of national importance and will contribute to the country's economic growth. They have also claimed that the project will be carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner and will not cause any harm to the forest ecosystem.

The Ministry of Environment & Forest, on the other hand, has not yet responded to the request for NOC. The court has therefore directed the respondent to place on record the response of the Ministry of Environment & Forest within two weeks.

The court's decision to grant two weeks' time for the respondent to place on record the response of the Ministry of Environment & Forest indicates that the court is taking a cautious approach to the matter. The court wants to ensure that all relevant information is available before making a decision on the request for NOC.

The court's decision to take up W.P.(PIL) No.2467 of 2013 along with W.P.(PIL) No.445 of 2013 on the next date of hearing also indicates that the court is taking a comprehensive view of the matter. W.P.(PIL) No.2467 of 2013 concerns a request for NOC for diversion of forest land for a thermal power project. The petitioners in this case have also argued that the project is of national importance and will contribute to the country's economic growth.

The court's decision to take up both petitions together suggests that the court wants to consider the broader implications of the requests for NOC. The court may also want to ensure that the requests are in line with the objectives of the Forest Conservation Act and do not violate its provisions.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to two petitions, W.P.(PIL) No.445 of 2013 and W.P.(PIL) No.2467 of 2013, which seek NOCs for diversion of forest land for mining and thermal power projects respectively. The court has granted two weeks' time for the respondent to place on record the response of the Ministry of Environment & Forest. The court has also decided to take up both petitions together on the next date of hearing, which suggests that the court is taking a comprehensive view of the matter and wants to ensure that the requests for NOC are in line with the objectives of the Forest Conservation Act.
