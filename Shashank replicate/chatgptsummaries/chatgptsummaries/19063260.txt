The Rajasthan High Court recently heard multiple petitions from owners of stone crushers who were challenging two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke consent to operate, leading to the closure of the units. The petitioners argued that they had no other option but to approach the court under its writ jurisdiction as the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time. The court heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions and the violation of principles of natural justice. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter back to the Board for reconsideration.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, which empowers the State Board to inspect and give directions to control air pollution. Section 21 of the Act requires the Board's consent to operate any industrial plant in the air pollution control area. The Board can grant, refuse, or cancel consent. Section 31 of the Act allows a person to appeal against an order made by the State Board. The court rejects the Board's argument that the petitioners had a right to file an appeal against directions issued under Section 31A of the Act. The court also holds that the existence of an alternate remedy does not bar a person from invoking the writ jurisdiction of a High Court. The court then discusses the contentions raised by both parties regarding the impugned orders passed by the Board. The petitioners argue that the Board violated the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Board argues that it was justified in relying on earlier notices and replies submitted by the petitioners. The court ultimately holds that the impugned orders are legally untenable and violate the principles of natural justice and the petitioners' fundamental rights.

In another case involving M/s Bahubali Stone Crusher and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, the Board had issued an order to close down the stone crusher units due to non-compliance with pollution control measures. The court found that the Board did not follow the proper procedure for granting or revoking consent to operate, and the notice given to the stone crusher units was vague and unclear. The court declared the Board's orders to be legally unsustainable and invalid. The court emphasized the importance of following proper procedures and giving clear notices in accordance with principles of natural justice and constitutional mandates.

In yet another case, a stone crusher company was found to be lacking in pollution control measures. The State Board had refused to renew the company's consent to operate due to these deficiencies. However, the court found that the Board had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims and had violated the principles of natural justice. The court quashed the Board's orders and directed them to consider the company's application for renewal within four months, issue a temporary consent to operate for one month, inspect the site, and collect air samples. The court also directed the state government to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones.

The court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court has been actively hearing cases related to stone crushers and pollution control measures. The court has emphasized the importance of following proper procedures and giving clear notices in accordance with principles of natural justice and constitutional mandates. The court has also ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The court's orders are expected to have a significant impact on the stone crusher industry in Rajasthan and the state's efforts to control air pollution.
