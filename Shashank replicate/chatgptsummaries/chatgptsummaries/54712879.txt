Sukhram, who was arrested in connection with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, has been granted bail by the court. The court has directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two sureties of Rs. 50,000 each for his appearance before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can be conserved and protected.

Sukhram's arrest in connection with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act suggests that he may have been involved in some illegal activity related to wildlife. The court's decision to grant him bail indicates that he may not be considered a flight risk or a danger to society.

The court's order for Sukhram to execute a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two sureties of Rs. 50,000 each is a common practice in India. It is a way to ensure that the accused appears before the court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. The personal bond is a legal document that binds the accused to appear before the court, and the sureties are individuals who guarantee that the accused will comply with the terms of the bond.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sukhram is not a final verdict on his case. It simply means that he will be released from custody until the completion of the trial. The trial will determine whether Sukhram is guilty or not guilty of the offence he has been charged with.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sukhram, who was arrested in connection with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two sureties of Rs. 50,000 each for his appearance before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. This decision does not indicate whether Sukhram is guilty or not guilty of the offence he has been charged with. The trial will determine his guilt or innocence.
