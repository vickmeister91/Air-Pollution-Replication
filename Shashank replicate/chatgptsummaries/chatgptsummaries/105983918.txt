The Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur issued an order on October 12, 2011, regarding multiple civil writ petitions filed by various companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The order lists the case numbers and names of the petitioners. The order was pronounced by Hon'ble Chief Justice Mr. Arun Mishra and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Alok Sharma. The petitioners were represented by Mr. M.S. Singhvi and his team, while Mr. M.R. Singhvi, Mr. R.L. Jangid, and Mr. Anand Purohit represented the State of Rajasthan and others.

The court order pertains to writ petitions filed by mining lease holders challenging the validity of Chapter VII of the Rajasthan Finance Act, 2008, which provides for the levy of cess on mineral rights. The petitioners argue that the field is already occupied by the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and other central legislation, and that the state government had no competence to enact the Finance Act, 2008 and the rules framed thereunder. The court is asked to determine whether the cess is a fee or a tax, and whether it falls within the purview of the state or central government. The petitioners rely on various laws and court decisions to support their arguments.

The court order refers to a case regarding the validity of a notification dated 23.1.2009 that seeks to levy environment and health cess with retrospective effect. The respondents argue that the State has the legislative competence to enact such provisions. The petitioners argue that the provisions of Chapter VII of the Finance Act, 2008 are ultravires, and the field is fully occupied by the Central Legislation. The court is asked to decide whether the State has the power to levy environmental or health cess in so far as it concerns major minerals. The petitioners argue that the cess levied is in the nature of a fee and is covered by the provisions of Section 13 of MMDR Act,1957 as well as other Central enactments and the Rules framed thereunder. The court is also asked to decide whether the Royalty was a tax.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Finance Act, 2008, which levies an environment and health cess on mineral rights to protect the environment and public health. The court allows the writ petitions challenging the validity of the provisions and rules, stating that the state has the competence to enact them. The court also refers to the various entries in the Constitution of India related to regulation of mines and mineral development, labor and safety in mines and oilfields, and taxes on assets and companies. The order also explains the powers and functions of the Rajasthan Environment and Health Administrative Board, which is responsible for managing the fund collected through the cess.

The court order discusses the different entries in List I, List II, and List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution. It also examines the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and the power of the State Government to impose and levy environment and health cess on mineral rights. The court concludes that the State Government has the power to impose and levy such cess, as the provisions of the MMDR Act do not divest the State of this power. The court also discusses the different sections of the MMDR Act, including Section 13(1) and Section 13(2)(i), which deal with the power of the Central Government to make rules in respect of minerals and the collection of fees for reconnaissance permits, prospecting licences, or mining leases.

The court order discusses the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957 and how they relate to the State's power to levy an environment and health cess on mineral rights under Entry 50 of List II of the Constitution of India. The court concludes that the State is competent to levy such a cess and that the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957 do not impinge upon this power. The court also discusses Rule 23F of the Rules of 1988, which provides for financial assurance to be given by every lease holder, and concludes that it does not cover the matter of the environment and health cess.

The court order discusses the provisions related to financial assurance for reclamation and rehabilitation measures in the mining industry. It clarifies that such financial assurance does not cover the field of environment and health cess on mineral rights. The order also explains the provisions related to environmental safeguards and safety measures in the mining industry under various laws and regulations. The court concludes that there is no conflict between the provisions of the Finance Act, 2008 and the existing legislation related to mining and mineral development.

The court order discusses the power of the state and union governments to levy taxes on mineral rights. It emphasizes that the subject matter of the levy should not be confused with the method of assessment or realization. The court also notes that there can be overlapping in the methodology of assessment but not in the subject matter of two taxes. The court clarifies that the power to tax mineral rights is with the state, and any limitations on this power must be imposed by the union. The court concludes that the state has the plenary power to tax mineral rights, and the levy of a cess on mineral rights for environmental and health purposes does not impinge upon regulation of mines and mineral development or upon control of industry by the union.
