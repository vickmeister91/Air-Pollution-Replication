Two court orders have been discussed in this text summarization. The first court order pertains to a compensation claim by a mother whose son died due to electrocution caused by a snapped live 11 KV electric wire. The defendants, who are responsible for the generation and transmission of electricity, argued that there was no negligence on their part and that the incident was due to the Act of God and the contributory negligence of the deceased. However, the court upheld the principle of strict liability and awarded compensation to the plaintiff, stating that the defendants failed to discharge the initial onus of proof. The defendants' appeal was dismissed.

The second court order discusses a case where a cyclist died due to electrocution from a snapped live wire. The defendants argued that the incident was due to an Act of God, but the court found that they failed to take necessary precautions and were therefore liable for compensation. The court also discussed the burden of proof in such cases and upheld the compensation awarded by the trial court. The defendants were given two months to deposit the amount due under the decree, and if they failed to do so, the plaintiff could proceed to recover the amounts due.

In both cases, the defendants argued that the incidents were due to an Act of God, which is a legal term used to describe an event that is beyond human control and could not have been prevented by reasonable care or foresight. However, the courts found that the defendants had failed to take necessary precautions and were therefore liable for compensation.

The principle of strict liability was upheld in the first case, which means that the defendants were held liable for the harm caused to the plaintiff, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. The court found that the defendants had failed to discharge the initial onus of proof, which means that they were unable to prove that they had taken all necessary precautions to prevent the incident from occurring.

In the second case, the court discussed the burden of proof in such cases. The burden of proof is the responsibility of proving a fact or allegation in a legal case. In this case, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to prove that the defendants were liable for the incident. The court found that the plaintiff had discharged the burden of proof and upheld the compensation awarded by the trial court.

Both court orders highlight the importance of taking necessary precautions to prevent harm to others. The defendants in both cases were held liable for the harm caused to the plaintiffs because they had failed to take necessary precautions. The courts also emphasized the burden of proof in such cases, which is the responsibility of proving a fact or allegation in a legal case.

In conclusion, both court orders discussed in this text summarization pertain to compensation claims for incidents caused by snapped live wires. The defendants in both cases argued that the incidents were due to an Act of God, but the courts found that they had failed to take necessary precautions and were therefore liable for compensation. The courts also emphasized the principle of strict liability and the burden of proof in such cases.
