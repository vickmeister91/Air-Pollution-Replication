Dr. Amit Singhal had filed a criminal misc. petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Parbatsar, District Nagaur, in Regular Criminal Case No.300/2016. The petitioner was charged under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act. The petitioner had moved an application under Section 246(4) Cr.P.C. with a prayer for summoning some of the witnesses, whose evidence was recorded at the pre-charge stage. The ACJM, Parbatsar dismissed the application filed by the petitioner under Section 246(4) Cr.P.C. mainly on the ground that the petitioner has moved the said application after about one year with the intention to delay the matter.

The petitioner argued that he had no opportunity to inform the trial court regarding his wish to cross-examine some of the prosecution witnesses, whose evidence was recorded at pre-trial stage. The petitioner's application seeking permission to cross-examine some of the prosecution witnesses was moved on 25.01.2016, however, the same was decided by the ACJM, Parbatsar only on 09.11.2016. The court order pertains to a petitioner who had applied for permission to cross-examine some of the prosecution witnesses, whose statements were recorded at pre-trial stage. The application was rejected by the ACJM, Parbatsar on the ground of delay. The petitioner argued that he should be given one opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses in the interest of justice.

The court allowed the petition and set aside the impugned order, directing the ACJM, Parbatsar to consider the application afresh after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner had a right to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements were recorded at the pre-trial stage, and the delay in filing the application was not sufficient ground to deny the petitioner this right. The court observed that the right to cross-examine witnesses is a fundamental right of the accused, and it cannot be denied on the ground of delay unless there is a valid reason for the delay.

The court further held that the ACJM, Parbatsar had not considered the petitioner's application on merits and had dismissed it solely on the ground of delay. The court observed that the ACJM, Parbatsar had not given any reasons for dismissing the application, and had not considered the petitioner's contention that he had no opportunity to inform the trial court regarding his wish to cross-examine the witnesses. The court held that the ACJM, Parbatsar had failed to exercise his discretion judiciously and had acted arbitrarily in dismissing the application.

The court, therefore, set aside the impugned order and directed the ACJM, Parbatsar to consider the petitioner's application afresh after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court also directed the ACJM, Parbatsar to consider the petitioner's contention that he had no opportunity to inform the trial court regarding his wish to cross-examine the witnesses, and to give reasons for his decision.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a petitioner who had applied for permission to cross-examine some of the prosecution witnesses, whose statements were recorded at pre-trial stage. The application was rejected by the ACJM, Parbatsar on the ground of delay. The court allowed the petition and set aside the impugned order, directing the ACJM, Parbatsar to consider the application afresh after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The court held that the right to cross-examine witnesses is a fundamental right of the accused, and it cannot be denied on the ground of delay unless there is a valid reason for the delay. The court also held that the ACJM, Parbatsar had failed to exercise his discretion judiciously and had acted arbitrarily in dismissing the application.
