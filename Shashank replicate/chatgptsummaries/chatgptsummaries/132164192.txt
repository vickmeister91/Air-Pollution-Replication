The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/s Rahul Texo Print. The petition challenged the action of the Sub Divisional Officer, Balotra, who had directed Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited (JVVNL) to disconnect the electricity supply of the petitioner. The petitioner had carried out repairs to the leakage/seepage found in the gutter/drain built of RCC adjacent to the wall inside the industry, which was verified by the inspecting team of Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB), Balotra. However, the electricity supply was not restored by the respondents.

The court allowed the petition and directed the respondents to restore the electricity supply of the petitioner. The court found that the petitioner had taken necessary steps to rectify the issue and had obtained the necessary approvals from the RSPCB. The court also noted that the respondents had not provided any valid reason for not restoring the electricity supply.

The court order highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary approvals before carrying out any repairs or modifications to industrial structures. It also emphasizes the need for government agencies to provide valid reasons for their actions and decisions.

In conclusion, the court order serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to adhere to the rules and regulations governing industrial activities and to ensure that necessary approvals are obtained before carrying out any repairs or modifications. It also underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in government decision-making processes.
