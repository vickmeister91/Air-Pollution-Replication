The court order summaries provided pertain to the issue of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in India. PIL has become a tool for blackmail and is often used for personal or political gain, rather than for the benefit of the poor and weaker sections of society. The court emphasizes that each case must be examined on its own facts and that the judiciary must occupy the field to subserve public interest if there is a buffer zone unoccupied by the legislature or executive which is detrimental to the public interest. 

The court order emphasizes the importance of proper research and qualification in raising issues in petitions, as rejection may affect third party rights. The court also warns against abusing the process of public interest litigation for personal gain or political motives. The order cites previous cases to highlight the need for genuine public interest and clean intentions in such litigation. The definition of "public interest" is also provided.

The court order discusses the scope of public interest litigation and emphasizes the importance of genuine litigants with legitimate grievances. The court warns against the abuse of the PIL process by individuals with personal gain or political motives. The court also stresses the need for caution in using PIL as a weapon for social justice and not for personal vendettas or publicity-seeking. The order highlights the importance of using PIL with care and circumspection to deliver social justice to citizens.

The court order emphasizes that petitions brought before the court must be bona fide and not motivated by personal gain or political motives. The court must ensure that the applicant has credible credentials and that the information provided is not vague or indefinite. The court must strike a balance between preventing reckless allegations and avoiding mischievous petitions. The court should act ruthlessly towards imposters and meddlesome interlopers who masquerade as crusaders of justice. The court must maintain social balance by interfering where necessary for the sake of justice and refusing to interfere where it is against the social interest and public good. The court should weed out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique motives.

The court order emphasizes that petitions filed with an oblique motive do not have the approval of the courts. It cites previous cases where the court has cautioned against the misuse of public interest litigation and the need for clear guidelines and self-imposed restraint on public interest litigants. The court also distinguishes between legitimate litigants and busybodies or meddlesome interlopers who interfere in matters that do not concern them. The court's duty is to enforce fundamental rights while ensuring that public interest litigation is used properly in proper cases.

The court order emphasizes that while it is important to enforce fundamental rights, the court must ensure that the Article 32 weapon is not misused or abused, creating a bottleneck in the superior court and preventing other genuine violations of fundamental rights from being considered. The court cites previous cases where public interest litigation was abused for personal gain or publicity, and emphasizes that the jurisdiction of public interest litigation should be invoked sparingly and in favor of vigilant litigants, not for those who seek to serve their private ends. The court warns against unscrupulous litigants who use public interest litigation to jeopardize the rights of innocent people for personal gain.

The court order discusses the misuse of public interest litigation by individuals or organizations for personal gain or professional rivalry. The court emphasizes that this jurisdiction should only be exercised in rare cases involving the public interest of a large number of people who cannot afford litigation. The court also stresses the importance of filtering out frivolous petitions and imposing exemplary costs to discourage oblique motives. The court expresses concern that such trumpery proceedings waste valuable judicial time and delay the disposal of cases of genuine litigants.

The court order emphasizes that public interest litigation should only be used for genuine public wrongs or injuries, and not for personal gain or political motives. The court warns against frivolous petitions and misuse of the court's time, and stresses the importance of acting bona fide. The court cites previous cases where petitions were dismissed due to lack of seriousness or evidence, and notes that the courts are being flooded with frivolous PILs.

The court order references a previous case where a writ petition filed by an Assistant Medical Officer was entertained by the High Court, even though it was filed for the vindication of a private interest. The court held that an enquiry into the conduct of examiners of a premier university in India was a matter of public interest and necessary for the administration of justice. The court also lays down principles governing obligations of litigants while approaching the court and consequences for abuse of process of law while filing Public Interest Litigation. The court emphasizes that public interest litigation is a powerful tool to espouse the cause of the marginalized and oppressed, and that the person who moves the court has no personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings apart from a general standing as a citizen before the court.

The court order discusses the development of public interest litigation and its importance in promoting structural due process. However, the misuse of public interest litigation for personal or business agendas is a serious concern and detracts from the time and attention that courts must devote to genuine causes. The High Court of Madras has issued rules to regulate public interest litigations, including the requirement that the petitioner has no personal interest in the case and that details of the persons for whose benefit the PIL is filed must be indicated. The court warns that the misuse of public interest litigation poses a grave danger to the credibility of the judicial process and
