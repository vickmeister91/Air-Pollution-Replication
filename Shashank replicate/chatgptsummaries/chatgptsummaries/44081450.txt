In a recent court order, the petitioner Kamal Oraon had sought anticipatory bail in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. However, the petitioner's counsel sought permission to withdraw the application, which was granted by the court. As a result, the anticipatory bail application was dismissed as withdrawn.

The court order also directed the lower court records to be sent to the court below at the cost of the Registry. This means that the records of the case will be transferred to the court below, which will be responsible for further proceedings.

It is important to note that the Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the prevention of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife.

In this case, it is not clear what specific charges the petitioner was facing under the Wild Life Protection Act. However, it is likely that the charges were related to the illegal hunting or trade of wildlife, which are serious offenses under the act.

Anticipatory bail is a legal provision that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested or detained for a non-bailable offense. This means that if a person fears that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offense, they can approach the court for anticipatory bail to avoid being taken into custody.

In this case, the petitioner had sought anticipatory bail, which was subsequently withdrawn by their counsel. It is not clear why the petitioner's counsel chose to withdraw the application, but it is possible that they may have found an alternative legal strategy to deal with the charges.

Overall, the court order in this case is relatively straightforward. The petitioner had sought anticipatory bail, which was subsequently withdrawn by their counsel. The court ordered the lower court records to be transferred to the court below, which will be responsible for further proceedings. It is not clear what specific charges the petitioner was facing under the Wild Life Protection Act, but it is likely that they were related to the illegal hunting or trade of wildlife.
