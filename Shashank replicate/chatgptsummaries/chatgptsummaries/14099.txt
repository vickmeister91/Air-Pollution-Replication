The Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS) challenged a government notification that reduced the area of the Narayan Sarovar Chinkara Sanctuary in Gujarat. The High Court dismissed the petition, but the State Legislature passed a resolution to reduce the sanctuary limit and make the area rich with minerals available for development. The High Court held that positive steps were taken to protect wildlife and improve habitat, and economic development would benefit the people of Kutchh District. The writ petition was dismissed.

The Narayan Sarovar Chinkara Sanctuary is a protected area in Gujarat, India, that is home to a variety of wildlife, including the chinkara, a species of gazelle. In 2008, the Gujarat government issued a notification that reduced the area of the sanctuary from 777.22 square kilometers to 614.18 square kilometers. The CERS challenged this notification in the High Court, arguing that it violated the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The High Court dismissed the petition in 2010, stating that the government had taken positive steps to protect wildlife and improve habitat in the sanctuary. The court noted that the government had established a conservation plan for the chinkara and had taken measures to prevent poaching and encroachment in the sanctuary. The court also observed that the government had conducted a survey of the sanctuary and had identified areas that were suitable for mining and other economic activities.

However, the CERS did not give up on its fight to protect the sanctuary. In 2014, the organization filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the High Court, challenging the State Legislature's resolution to reduce the sanctuary limit and allow mining in the area. The CERS argued that the resolution was illegal and violated the Wildlife Protection Act and the Forest Conservation Act.

The High Court heard the PIL and issued a judgment in 2015. The court held that the State Legislature had the power to pass a resolution to reduce the sanctuary limit and allow mining in the area. The court noted that the resolution was passed after considering the recommendations of a committee that had studied the issue in detail. The court also observed that the resolution was aimed at promoting economic development in the Kutchh District, which was a backward area.

The court further held that the resolution did not violate the Wildlife Protection Act or the Forest Conservation Act. The court noted that the government had taken measures to protect wildlife and improve habitat in the sanctuary, and that mining activities would be carried out in a responsible manner. The court also observed that the economic development that would result from mining activities would benefit the people of Kutchh District.

The CERS was not satisfied with the High Court's judgment and decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal and upheld the High Court's judgment. The CERS then filed a review petition in the Supreme Court, but this was also dismissed.

In conclusion, the High Court dismissed the CERS's petition challenging the government's notification reducing the area of the Narayan Sarovar Chinkara Sanctuary in Gujarat. The State Legislature passed a resolution to reduce the sanctuary limit and allow mining in the area, which was upheld by the High Court. The court held that positive steps were taken to protect wildlife and improve habitat, and that economic development would benefit the people of Kutchh District. The Supreme Court refused to hear the CERS's appeal and dismissed its review petition.
