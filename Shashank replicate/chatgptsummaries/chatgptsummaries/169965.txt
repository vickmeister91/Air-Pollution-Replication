The recent court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Hindalco Industries Limited against the State of Jharkhand and others. The petitioner sought to quash an order issued by the Divisional Forest Officer, Medninagar, Palamau, directing the petitioner to stop mining activity and seek permission from the Union of India to avoid violating the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. The petitioner argued that it had already obtained all necessary clearances and invested heavily in the mining infrastructure.

The court has allowed four weeks for the newly added respondent to file a detailed counter-affidavit and has scheduled the case to be put up on December 12, 2017. In the meantime, the operation of two letters/memos related to mining operations shall remain stayed, subject to the condition that the petitioner shall not undertake any mining operation on 344.16 acres of leased area recorded as 'Jungle Jhari' in the earlier survey.
