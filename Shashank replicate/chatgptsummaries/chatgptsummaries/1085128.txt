The Madras High Court recently issued two court orders that pertain to the Income Tax Act, 1961. The first order involves an appeal by Mettur Chemical and Industrial Corporation Limited against the Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madras-1. The case revolves around the applicability of Section 84 of the Income Tax Act, which provides relief to industrial undertakings. The court ruled that the relief could only be claimed from the year in which the undertaking began to manufacture or produce articles, and not from the year in which the installation was completed. The court also held that development rebate should be deducted in arriving at the business income for the purpose of relief under Section 84.

The second court order discusses a previous decision regarding the deduction of unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate in computing profits for a special deduction under Section 80E. The court concludes that development rebate should be deducted from total income before the special deduction is applied. The court also notes that a previous decision by the Punjab & Haryana High Court is no longer valid. The appeal is dismissed and each party is responsible for their own costs.
