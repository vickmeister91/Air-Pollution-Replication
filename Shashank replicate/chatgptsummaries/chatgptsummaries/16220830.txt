The court has granted anticipatory bail to Lalan Singh, who has been accused of violating various sections of the Indian Forest Act and the Conservation of Forest Act. The allegation against him is that he has constructed a house on a notified plot, which he denies. In his plea for anticipatory bail, he has stated that he is willing to bear the cost of demolition of any house standing on the plot and undertakes not to go to or over the plot during the pendency of the case.

The court has granted him anticipatory bail on the condition that he surrenders within one month and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties. He must also cooperate in the demolition of any house on the plot, and failure to do so will result in the cancellation of his bail.
