The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of externment, which is the expulsion of a person from a particular area. The first court order pertains to a petitioner, Hanuman Rajaram Mhatre, who sought to quash a show cause notice and an order of externment issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police on behalf of the State of Maharashtra. The petitioner was directed to be externed from Mumbai Suburbs, New Mumbai, Thane, and Raigarh Districts for two years due to illegal acts committed under the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner argued that he was a law-abiding citizen and that the acts alleged against him were not true. However, the court upheld the order of externment based on the allegations made against the petitioner.

The second court order lists several criminal cases against the petitioner, including pending cases and cases where they were acquitted. The petitioner was granted bail in respect of the pending cases. The petitioner's counsel argued that the allegations against the petitioner were false and that there was no compelling reason to extern the petitioner from four districts. The court found that the authority failed to consider the proximity and remoteness of the cases listed in the show-cause notice and that there was a non-application of mind as to the necessity of externment. Therefore, the court found that the order of externment was not justified.

The third court order pertains to an externment order issued against a petitioner in Mumbai. The petitioner's counsel argued that the order was excessive and not based on proper application of mind, as the petitioner had been acquitted in most cases and was out on bail in others. The counsel requested that the order be quashed. The state argued that the order was necessary to maintain law and order and prevent future offenses. The court examined the relevant section of the Bombay Police Act and found that an externment order can only be passed if the person's acts are causing harm or if there are reasonable grounds to believe they are about to commit an offense. The court found that the order was not justified and quashed it.

The fourth court order states that the provision of Section 56, which allows for externment of a person, should only be used in exceptional cases when the person's actions are causing harm or danger to others. The order must be based on objective evidence and the person must be given a fair opportunity to defend themselves. The right to personal liberty is important and should not be violated without compelling necessity. The order must also take into account the potential adverse effects on the person being externed, such as loss of livelihood. In this particular case, the court found no tangible evidence to support the externment order against the petitioner.

The fifth court order quashes an order of externment against the petitioner, who had been restricted from moving freely in certain areas. The court cites a previous ruling that a petitioner can approach the court if their fundamental rights have been infringed, without exhausting other remedies provided for in the act. The court finds the order of externment to be excessive and unsustainable in law, as there were no criminal cases reported against the petitioner in the extended areas. Therefore, the court allows the petition and sets aside the order of externment.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to cases of externment and highlight the importance of ensuring that such orders are based on objective evidence and are necessary to maintain law and order. The right to personal liberty is important and should not be violated without compelling necessity. The court orders also emphasize the need to consider the potential adverse effects on the person being externed, such as loss of livelihood. Ultimately, the court orders demonstrate the importance of ensuring that the law is applied fairly and justly in all cases.
