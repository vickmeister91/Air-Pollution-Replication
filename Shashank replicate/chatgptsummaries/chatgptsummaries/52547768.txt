In a recent court order, a revision petition filed by Narendra Nath Kampoor against the State of M.P. was dismissed. The petition was filed because an application filed under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the trial court. However, since no one was present on behalf of the petitioner, the court dismissed the petition for want of prosecution.

The case involved an application filed by Kampoor under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). This section allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The application was dismissed by the trial court, which led to the filing of the revision petition.

However, the court dismissed the petition for want of prosecution as no one was present on behalf of the petitioner. This means that the petitioner did not appear in court to argue his case or provide any evidence to support his claims. As a result, the court had no choice but to dismiss the petition.

This court order highlights the importance of being present in court and actively participating in legal proceedings. If a petitioner fails to appear in court or provide evidence to support their claims, their case may be dismissed for want of prosecution. This can have serious consequences, as it means that the petitioner will not be able to pursue their legal claim or seek justice through the legal system.

It is also important to note that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. can be a useful tool for obtaining evidence in criminal cases. This section allows a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. This can be particularly useful in cases where the prosecution or defense needs to obtain evidence that is in the possession of a third party.

In conclusion, the dismissal of the revision petition filed by Narendra Nath Kampoor against the State of M.P. highlights the importance of being present in court and actively participating in legal proceedings. It also serves as a reminder of the usefulness of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for obtaining evidence in criminal cases.
