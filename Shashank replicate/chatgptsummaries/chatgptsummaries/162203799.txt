The Patna High Court recently heard a case involving India Rubber Product Industries, which was ordered to close its industrial plant for non-compliance with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner had failed to file an application seeking 'Consent to Operate' under the Act, which led to the Member Secretary of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board rejecting the petitioner's application seeking 'Consent to Operate'. However, the petitioner had filed a fresh application for 'Consent to Establish' in accordance with the statutory provisions, which remained pending before 'the Board' for disposal.

The court found that the Member Secretary had committed a serious illegality in rejecting the application of the petitioner seeking 'Consent to Operate' even when his application seeking 'Consent to Establish' remained pending before 'the Board' for disposal. The rejection of the petitioner's application for 'Consent to Operate' was deemed illegal by the court, as their application for 'Consent to Establish' was still pending. The court also noted that the validity of the 'Consent to Establish' order was only six months.

The court ordered the competent authority of 'the Board' to consider both applications afresh and dispose of them in accordance with the law within six weeks. The court quashed and set aside the previous order and directed the competent authority to consider the applications with an independent mind.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and the establishment of Boards at the central and state levels to implement the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides for the regulation of industries and other activities that cause air pollution.

The case of India Rubber Product Industries highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Act and obtaining the necessary permissions and consents before operating an industrial plant. The Act requires industries to obtain 'Consent to Establish' and 'Consent to Operate' from the State Pollution Control Board before commencing operations. The 'Consent to Establish' is granted for a period of six months, during which the industry must complete the necessary installations and comply with the prescribed standards. Once the industry has complied with the prescribed standards, it can apply for 'Consent to Operate', which is granted for a period of five years.

The court's order in the case of India Rubber Product Industries emphasizes the need for the competent authority to consider applications for 'Consent to Establish' and 'Consent to Operate' with an independent mind and dispose of them in accordance with the law. The court's order also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Act and obtaining the necessary permissions and consents before operating an industrial plant.

In conclusion, the case of India Rubber Product Industries serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and obtaining the necessary permissions and consents before operating an industrial plant. The court's order in the case emphasizes the need for the competent authority to consider applications for 'Consent to Establish' and 'Consent to Operate' with an independent mind and dispose of them in accordance with the law. The Act plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling air pollution in India, and it is essential for industries to comply with its provisions to ensure a cleaner and healthier environment for all.
