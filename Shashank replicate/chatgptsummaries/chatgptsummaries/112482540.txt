In a recent court order, the applicants, Pooran Mehra and others, who were in custody since January 6, 2013, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, were granted bail. The court allowed the bail application without expressing any view on the merits of the case and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to secure their presence before the court on all hearing dates during the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the applicants were charged with violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The exact nature of the charges is not clear from the court order, but it can be assumed that the applicants were involved in some form of illegal hunting, poaching, or trade in wildlife or their products.

The court order granting bail to the applicants is significant as it allows them to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. Bail is a legal provision that allows a person to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing, subject to certain conditions. The conditions of bail are usually set by the court and may include the requirement to furnish a personal bond, provide sureties, surrender passports, and report to the police regularly.

In this case, the court has directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to secure their presence before the court on all hearing dates during the trial. This means that the applicants will have to provide a sum of money as security to ensure that they attend all court hearings during the trial. Failure to attend court hearings may result in the forfeiture of the bond and the re-arrest of the applicants.

It is important to note that the court has granted bail to the applicants without expressing any view on the merits of the case. This means that the court has not made any determination on whether the applicants are guilty or not guilty of the charges against them. The court has simply allowed them to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing, subject to the conditions of bail.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to the applicants, Pooran Mehra and others, who were in custody since January 6, 2013, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is significant as it allows them to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing.
