The court order pertains to a conflict of interest clause in a tender condition issued by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for the installation of an RFID-based electronic toll collection system. The petitioner, Vaaan Infra Pvt. Ltd., challenged the clause under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner argued that the clause was arbitrary and unfair as it prevented them from bidding for the project. The SDMC argued that the clause was designed in consultation with the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority and was necessary to avoid conflicts of interest. The court analyzed the rival contentions and ultimately upheld the clause.

The court order discusses a conflict of interest condition in a tender for an RFID project issued by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The petitioner, Vaaan Infra Pvt. Ltd., challenged the condition, which barred consultants who had worked on any aspect of the project from bidding. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the condition was arbitrary and held that it was necessary to ensure integrity in the bidding process. The court also stated that it could not examine the extent of the petitioner's participation in the project survey and its relevance to the RFID contract. The court cited the principle of judicial restraint in administrative action and the need for technical expertise in assessing bids for complex technical subjects.

The court order states that tenders for public contracts require technical expertise and should aim for perfection in execution and adherence to time schedules. However, the court can exercise judicial review if the approach is arbitrary or malafide. The court should follow the principle of restraint and not interfere with technical evaluation or comparison. The court's role in adjudging issues relating to award of public contracts is limited, and it cannot evaluate whether the tender conditions are unfairly drawn unless they are patently arbitrary or manifestly unfair. In this case, the court found no allegations of mala fides, illegality, or procedural irregularity, and therefore dismissed the writ petition.
