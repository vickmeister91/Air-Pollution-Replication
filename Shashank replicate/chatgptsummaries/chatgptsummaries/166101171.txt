The first court order involves a case between M/S Delhi Bhiwani Transport Co. and the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner's buses had been granted stage carriage permits by the State Transport Authority of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) had started challaning the buses on the ground of overtaking, picking up/dropping passengers without a valid bus stop. The documents of the petitioner including R.C. fitness certificate and permits had been seized. The petitioner chose to compound the same by paying fines ranging from Rs. 2000/- to Rs. 5,600/-. The petitioner filed a writ petition stating that the acts of the respondents are arbitrary and unjustified and violate his fundamental rights. The court dismissed the petition and stated that the provisions of Section 200(2) are not attracted.

The second court order discusses the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the M.C. Mehta case regarding the operation of heavy and medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles in Delhi. The directions include fitting speed control devices, not overtaking other vehicles, confining buses to designated lanes, and halting only at designated bus stops. The court clarifies that these directions must be read in the light of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and cannot be used to harass bus operators for minor violations. The court also notes that the directions were issued by a three-judge bench and subsequently clarified by a two-judge bench, causing some difficulty in interpretation. The court acknowledges the concerns of both the petitioners and the traffic police regarding the implementation of these directions.

The third court order suggests that the traffic police must follow the directions issued in M.C. Mehta v. UOI as implied conditions of every permit and have no discretion in the matter. The court advises the petitioners to seek clarification from the Supreme Court regarding a subsequent judgment in the UPSRTC case. The court also notes that an appeal has been filed against the judgment of the Tara Kant Jha case, but there is no stay. The court concludes that the judgment and directions in the Tara Kant Jha case are binding and no further orders are necessary.
