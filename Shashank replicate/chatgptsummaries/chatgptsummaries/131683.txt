The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by a decree-holder against a surety who had stood for the judgment-debtor. The surety had claimed that the judgment-debtor had made payments to the decree-holder, but these payments were uncertified. The court had to determine whether the surety was still bound to the decree-holder, despite the uncertified payments.

The court ruled that the surety is bound as long as the judgment-debtor is bound. This means that the surety cannot escape liability simply because the judgment-debtor has made uncertified payments. The court held that the surety had undertaken a legal obligation to pay the decree-holder in case the judgment-debtor failed to do so. This obligation would continue until the judgment-debtor had fully satisfied the decree-holder's claim.

The court also noted that the surety had failed to produce any evidence to show that the judgment-debtor had made the payments in question. The court held that the surety could not rely on uncertified payments to escape liability. The court observed that the surety had taken a risk by standing as a surety for the judgment-debtor. The surety had undertaken to pay the decree-holder in case the judgment-debtor failed to do so. The court held that the surety could not escape this obligation simply because the payments made by the judgment-debtor were uncertified.

The court further held that the appeal of the decree-holder succeeds, and the execution can proceed. This means that the decree-holder can now proceed with the execution of the decree against the judgment-debtor and the surety. The court also held that the appellant is entitled to costs in all courts. This means that the decree-holder is entitled to recover the costs incurred in pursuing the appeal in all the courts where the appeal was heard.

Finally, the court assessed the hearing fee at two gold mohurs. This means that the decree-holder would have to pay a hearing fee of two gold mohurs for the appeal to be heard. The hearing fee is a fee that is paid to the court for hearing an appeal. The amount of the hearing fee is usually fixed by the court and varies depending on the nature and complexity of the case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an appeal made by a decree-holder against a surety who had stood for the judgment-debtor. The court held that the surety is bound as long as the judgment-debtor is bound, and since the payments made by the judgment-debtor were uncertified, the appeal of the decree-holder succeeds, and the execution can proceed. The appellant is entitled to costs in all courts, and the hearing fee is assessed at two gold mohurs. This order clarifies the legal obligations of a surety and underscores the importance of certified payments in legal transactions.
