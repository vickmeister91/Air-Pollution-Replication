The Madras High Court recently heard a case involving Sri. Basker and the State represented by the Labour Enforcement Officer. The case involved complaints filed under Section 23 of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 for the offence punishable under Section 12(1) of the same Act. The petitioner was a contractor who had employed 30 contract labourers for security work at IIT, Chennai without obtaining a Labour Licence from the Assistant Labour Commissioner(Central), Chennai.

The petitioner argued that the respondent had lodged a complaint without obtaining sanction as contemplated under Section 197 Cr.P.c. and that the Tamil Nadu Government Undertaking is including the TEXCO and the General Manager of the TEXCO is a public servant coming under the State Government. Therefore Section 197 Cr.P.C. is mandatory and it cannot be dispensed with to prosecute the petitioner.

The court order pertains to a complaint lodged against TEXCO, a government undertaking corporation, for failing to obtain a license for engaging contract laborers. The petitioner argues that as a public servant under the state government, Section 197 Cr.P.C. is mandatory and the Central Government official has no power to prosecute them. The respondent argues that the petitioner is a contractor and not a public servant, and therefore, Section 197 Cr.P.C. does not apply.

The court rules that the appropriate government in this case is the state government, and the complaint lodged by the Central Government is not maintainable. The court also rules that Section 197 Cr.P.C. does not apply as the petitioner is a contractor and not a public servant. The court order states that anyone who violates the provisions of the Contract Labourer (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 regarding the employment of contract labor can be punished with imprisonment for up to three months, a fine of up to one thousand rupees, or both. If the violation continues, an additional fine of up to one hundred rupees per day can be imposed.

However, if the offense is committed in the discharge of official duty, a sanction from the Central Government is mandatory before taking cognizance of the offense. The court also cites a previous case where it was held that only the State Government and officials acting under it can prefer a complaint for violations of the Act, and not a person working under a central enactment.

The court order states that the complaint filed by an official of the Central Government is not maintainable as the Central Government is not the appropriate government to file the complaint. The petitioner, who is a government servant, cannot be held guilty of the offense under the Contract Labourer (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 without proper sanction. The court also cites a Supreme Court judgment that states that there is no scope for invoking Section 197 Cr.P.C in the case on hand.

Therefore, the complaint lodged by the respondent is not maintainable, and the proceedings against the petitioner are quashed. The court order quashes the rulings of the Ranipet, IX Metropolitan Magistrate, and Saidapet, Chennai. The miscellaneous petitions related to the case are also closed. The order is dated April 29, 2019, and is addressed to various parties including the Labour Enforcement Officer and several Metropolitan Magistrates in Chennai.
