In a recent criminal revision case, the petitioner, Deen Mohammad, challenged the sufficiency of the questions asked to a doctor under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. The respondent argued that the post-mortem report supported the prosecution's case and the relevance of the body being of the concerned person or not did not need to be proved by a witness. The court cited precedent law and held that the relevance of evidence is to be considered, not its likely probative value. It also stated that a post-mortem report is an authenticated medical conclusion and the conclusion remains the same even if it is not supported by a witness. The court dismissed the revision petition.

The case in question involved a post-mortem report that supported the prosecution's case. The petitioner, Deen Mohammad, challenged the sufficiency of the questions asked to a doctor under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. The respondent argued that the post-mortem report was sufficient evidence and that the relevance of the body being of the concerned person or not did not need to be proved by a witness.

The court cited precedent law and held that the relevance of evidence is to be considered, not its likely probative value. It also stated that a post-mortem report is an authenticated medical conclusion and the conclusion remains the same even if it is not supported by a witness. The court dismissed the revision petition.

This ruling is significant because it clarifies the importance of evidence in criminal cases. The court emphasized that the relevance of evidence is more important than its likely probative value. This means that evidence that is relevant to the case should be considered, even if it may not be as strong as other evidence.

The court also emphasized the importance of post-mortem reports in criminal cases. These reports are considered authenticated medical conclusions and are therefore given significant weight in court. Even if a post-mortem report is not supported by a witness, its conclusion remains the same.

Overall, this ruling clarifies the importance of evidence in criminal cases and emphasizes the weight given to post-mortem reports. It also highlights the need for courts to consider the relevance of evidence, rather than just its likely probative value.
