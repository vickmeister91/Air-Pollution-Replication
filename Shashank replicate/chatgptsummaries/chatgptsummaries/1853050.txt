The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had directed a flour mill in Katihar to file returns for assessment of cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The mill argued that it did not come under the purview of the Act as it processed wheat, which is a cereal and not a vegetable. The court held that the industry of the petitioner did not come under the purview of the Act and was not liable to pay any cess. The court relied on the principle of strict construction of fiscal statutes and the common parlance meaning of the word "vegetable" in the Schedule appended to the Act. The court also overruled a previous decision of the Allahabad High Court on the matter.

The case involved a dispute between the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and a flour mill in Katihar. The Board had directed the mill to file returns for assessment of cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The mill argued that it did not come under the purview of the Act as it processed wheat, which is a cereal and not a vegetable. The court was called upon to decide whether the mill was liable to pay the cess.

The court held that the industry of the petitioner did not come under the purview of the Act and was not liable to pay any cess. The court relied on the principle of strict construction of fiscal statutes and the common parlance meaning of the word "vegetable" in the Schedule appended to the Act. The court also overruled a previous decision of the Allahabad High Court on the matter.

The court's decision was based on a strict interpretation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court held that the Act only applied to industries that processed vegetables and not to those that processed cereals. The court relied on the common parlance meaning of the word "vegetable" in the Schedule appended to the Act. The court held that the word "vegetable" was not defined in the Act and therefore had to be given its ordinary meaning.

The court also relied on the principle of strict construction of fiscal statutes. The court held that fiscal statutes must be construed strictly and that any ambiguity in the statute must be resolved in favour of the taxpayer. The court held that the Act did not clearly apply to industries that processed cereals and therefore the mill was not liable to pay the cess.

The court's decision overruled a previous decision of the Allahabad High Court on the matter. The Allahabad High Court had held that the Act applied to industries that processed cereals as well as vegetables. The court held that the Allahabad High Court had not considered the principle of strict construction of fiscal statutes and had not given due weight to the common parlance meaning of the word "vegetable".

In conclusion, the court held that the flour mill in Katihar was not liable to pay the cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court relied on the principle of strict construction of fiscal statutes and the common parlance meaning of the word "vegetable" in the Schedule appended to the Act. The court also overruled a previous decision of the Allahabad High Court on the matter. The court's decision provides clarity on the scope of the Act and will have implications for other industries that process cereals.
