The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the President of Aryankavu Grama Panchayat and two others. The petitioners had sought to quash a decision by the government to shift Sales Tax, Excise Tax and Motor Vehicle Check Posts from Aryankavu to Thenmala. The court found that the main grievance of the petitioners was against this decision and that the other non-connected contentions raised were inappropriate. The court rejected the writ petition as misconceived.

The petitioners had argued that the decision to shift the check posts would cause inconvenience to the public and would adversely affect the economic activities of the region. They also contended that the decision was taken without proper consultation with the local authorities and without considering the impact on the environment.

The court observed that the petitioners had not made out a case for interference in the decision-making process of the government. The court noted that the decision to shift the check posts was taken after due consideration of the relevant factors and that the government was entitled to take such a decision in the larger public interest.

The court also observed that the petitioners had not shown how the decision to shift the check posts would cause any specific harm to them. The court noted that the inconvenience caused to the public was a general grievance and that the petitioners had not shown how they were personally affected by the decision.

The court further observed that the petitioners had not made out a case for violation of any legal right. The court noted that the decision to shift the check posts was a policy decision and that the government was entitled to take such a decision in the exercise of its executive powers.

The court also rejected the contention of the petitioners that the decision was taken without proper consultation with the local authorities. The court observed that the government had consulted the local authorities and had taken their views into consideration before taking the decision.

The court further observed that the petitioners had not shown how the decision to shift the check posts would adversely affect the environment. The court noted that the government had taken adequate measures to mitigate the environmental impact of the decision.

In conclusion, the court found that the petitioners had not made out a case for interference in the decision-making process of the government. The court held that the decision to shift the check posts was taken in the larger public interest and that the government was entitled to take such a decision in the exercise of its executive powers.
