The recent court order pertains to three writ petitions filed by employees of Jindal Steel & Power Limited who were terminated from their jobs after the cancellation of the Gare-Palma-IV/1 coal mines by the Supreme Court. The petitioners argued that since the coal mines were now managed by Coal India Limited, Jindal Steel & Power Limited was not competent to terminate their services. The court noted that private companies are not normally amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but in certain circumstances, a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons as there may be statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned, including private companies.

The court order states that private bodies are bound to comply with statutory provisions such as the Industrial Disputes Act, Minimum Wages Act, and environmental acts. If they violate these provisions, a writ can be issued for compliance. However, if there is no violation of any statutory provision, a writ may not be issued. In the case at hand, the petitioners were terminated by a company registered under the Companies Act, and therefore the writ petition is not maintainable. As a result, all the petitions are dismissed.
