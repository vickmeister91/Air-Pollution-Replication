The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Premnarayan under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for offences punishable under Sections 2, 9, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that the applicant along with other co-accused killed a pair of white rabbits. The applicant has been in jail since 08.04.2018 and has been falsely implicated in the case.

The court, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, has allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/- with two solvent sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court/committal Court for his appearance on the dates given by the concerned Court. The applicant has to comply with certain conditions, failing which the bail order will be revoked.

The court's decision to grant bail to Premnarayan is based on the fact that he has been in jail for a considerable amount of time and that there is no evidence to suggest that he poses a threat to society or is likely to abscond. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the killing of the white rabbits.

The court has, however, imposed certain conditions on the applicant in order to ensure that he complies with the terms of his bail. These conditions include the requirement that he furnish a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/- with two solvent sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court/committal Court for his appearance on the dates given by the concerned Court. The applicant must also comply with any other conditions that may be imposed by the trial Court/committal Court.

The court has made it clear that if the applicant fails to comply with any of the conditions imposed on him, the bail order will be revoked. This means that the applicant will be taken back into custody and will have to remain in jail until the trial is completed.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Premnarayan is based on the fact that he has been in jail for a considerable amount of time and that there is no evidence to suggest that he poses a threat to society or is likely to abscond. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the killing of the white rabbits. However, the court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant in order to ensure that he complies with the terms of his bail.
