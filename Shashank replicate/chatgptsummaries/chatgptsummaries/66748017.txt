Asal Bai, a convicted offender under section 51(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, has filed a criminal revision against her conviction and sentence. The court has admitted the revision and allowed the suspension of her jail sentence. Asal Bai has been directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and a surety bond of the same amount for her release on bail. She has to appear before the Registry of the Court on 5/2/2018 and subsequent dates until the final adjudication of the revision.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Section 51(1) of the Act deals with the punishment for hunting or destroying wild animals or plants in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. The punishment for such an offense is imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, which may extend to seven years, and a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees, which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees.

Asal Bai's conviction and sentence under section 51(1) of the Act indicate that she was found guilty of hunting or destroying wild animals or plants in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. However, the details of the offense and the evidence against her are not mentioned in the court order. It is also not clear whether she was represented by a lawyer during the trial or whether she had appealed against her conviction and sentence earlier.

In any case, Asal Bai has now filed a criminal revision against her conviction and sentence, which means that she is challenging the decision of the lower court. A criminal revision is a legal remedy available to a person who is aggrieved by a judgment or order passed by a subordinate court. The revision is filed before a higher court, which has the power to examine the correctness, legality, or propriety of the decision of the lower court.

In this case, the higher court has admitted Asal Bai's revision, which means that it has found some merit in her arguments or grounds of appeal. The court has also allowed the suspension of her jail sentence, which means that she will not have to serve her sentence until the final adjudication of the revision. This is a significant relief for Asal Bai, as she can now be released on bail and be with her family and friends.

However, the court has also imposed certain conditions for her release on bail. Asal Bai has to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and a surety bond of the same amount, which means that she has to provide a guarantee that she will appear before the court whenever required. This is a standard condition for bail, as it ensures that the accused does not abscond or evade the trial. Asal Bai has also been directed to appear before the Registry of the Court on 5/2/2018 and subsequent dates until the final adjudication of the revision. This means that she has to attend the court hearings and comply with any other orders or directions of the court.

It is not clear when the final adjudication of the revision will take place or what the outcome of the revision will be. The court order does not mention any specific grounds or arguments raised by Asal Bai in her revision, nor does it indicate whether the prosecution has opposed the revision or not. It is also not clear whether the court has granted any interim relief or stay of proceedings in the case.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal revision filed by Asal Bai against her conviction and sentence under section 51(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has admitted the revision and allowed the suspension of her jail sentence. Asal Bai has been directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and a surety bond of the same amount for her release on bail. She has to appear before the Registry of the Court on 5/2/2018 and subsequent dates until the final adjudication of the revision. The details of the offense and the evidence against her are not mentioned in the court order, and it is not clear when the final adjudication of the revision will take place or what the outcome of the revision will be.
