The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Girdhar Filling Station against the District Magistrate Nagaur and others. The petitioner challenged the legality of an order issued by the District Magistrate, whereby the No Objection Certificate (NOC) issued in favor of the petitioner for operating a retail outlet of petroleum products was suspended. The suspension was made on account of the failure of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) to obtain the order for diversion of the approach road constructed on forest land to non-forest activities from the Department of Forest under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The petitioner contended that the suspension of the NOC was arbitrary and unjustified, as the District Authority is only empowered to cancel the NOC and not suspend it. The petitioner argued that the suspension of the NOC has caused them immense financial loss and has affected their business operations. The petitioner further contended that the suspension of the NOC was made without giving them an opportunity of being heard.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the action of the District Magistrate in suspending the NOC was arbitrary and unjustified. The court held that the District Authority is only empowered to cancel a NOC if the licensee has ceased to have any right to use the site for storing petroleum, but it does not have the power to suspend the NOC pending consideration of cancellation.

The court quashed the order cancelling the NOC and directed the District Magistrate to consider and decide the petitioner's application for a certificate required for further processing the application for diversion of the approach road forming part of forest land to non-forest activities within two weeks. The court also directed the District Magistrate to give the petitioner an opportunity of being heard before taking any action against them.

The court observed that the suspension of the NOC has caused immense financial loss to the petitioner and has affected their business operations. The court directed the District Magistrate to ensure that such arbitrary and unjustified actions are not taken in the future.

The court order is significant as it upholds the principle of natural justice and ensures that the District Authority does not act arbitrarily and unjustly. The court has also directed the District Magistrate to consider and decide the petitioner's application for a certificate required for further processing the application for diversion of the approach road forming part of forest land to non-forest activities within two weeks, which will enable the petitioner to resume their business operations.

In conclusion, the court order is a welcome relief for the petitioner and ensures that the District Authority acts in accordance with the law and does not act arbitrarily and unjustly. The court has upheld the principle of natural justice and has directed the District Magistrate to ensure that such arbitrary and unjustified actions are not taken in the future. The court order is a significant step towards ensuring that the rights of the citizens are protected and that the rule of law is upheld.
