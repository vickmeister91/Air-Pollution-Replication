The court order pertains to the mining activity in areas up to 5 kilometers from the Delhi-Haryana border on the Haryana side of the ridge and in the Aravalli hills. The court had previously directed the stoppage of mining activities within a radius of 5 kms. from Badkal Lake and Surajkund due to environmental concerns. The court is examining whether mining activity should be absolutely banned or permitted on compliance with stringent conditions to prevent environmental pollution.

The Environmental Pollution Central Authority (EPCA) was directed to give a report on the environment in the area, and their report found evidence of clear violations of key conditions. The report recommended the development of a green belt and the filling of excavated pits with fly ash or municipal solid waste. The report also noted the misuse and shortage of groundwater in the area and recommended rainwater harvesting and reuse of water.

The court order discusses the environmental impact of mining and stone crushing activities in various areas, including the ecologically sensitive Asola sanctuary and the Aravalli hills. The court has issued directives and regulations to regulate mining activities and protect the environment, but compliance and enforcement have been lacking. The report also highlights the impact of mining on groundwater reserves and recommends measures to conserve water resources and involve local communities in sustainable development. The report suggests extending the notification under the Environment (Protection) Act to the Faridabad part of the Aravalli and ridge and examining water planning in large-scale construction activities.

The court order recommends regulating mining activities in the Aravalli hills region, particularly in relation to the impact on groundwater levels. The report notes that some mines are owned by powerful individuals and political parties, and recommends tighter monitoring and public disclosure of environmental management plans and monitoring reports. The report also includes observations from inspections of specific mines, noting the extent of groundwater exploitation and lack of environmental clearances and management plans. The report recommends a ban on mining within 5km of the Delhi border and demarcation and regulation of mining areas outside of this zone.

The court order describes the inspection of various mines in Faridabad and Gurgaon, India. The report highlights that the mining activity is destroying the ground water reserves of the areas, and the ground water table is already at a critical stage in Faridabad. The report also mentions that most of the mining is happening inside the municipal area of Faridabad, which is close to ecologically sensitive areas like Surajkund and Badkhal lake. The report concludes that mining operations should not be carried out in the water table area.

The court order states that the rights of certain villages are with the municipal corporation and the gram panchayat. The region is ecologically sensitive and mining activities could have serious implications for the groundwater reserve. The court has heard submissions from various parties regarding the continuation of the mining order and the interpretation of notifications regarding mining activities. The notification dated 7th May, 1992 bans all new mining operations including renewals of mining leases and sets out the procedure for taking prior permission before undertaking such an activity. The notification dated 27th January, 1994, as amended on 4th May, 1994, stipulates that expansion or modernization of any activity or a new project listed in Schedule I of the notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by the Central Government.

The court order outlines the process for obtaining environmental clearance for mining projects. The Impact Assessment Agency will evaluate reports submitted by project authorities and may consult a Committee of Experts. Public hearings may be held, and the clearance will be valid for five years. The order also lists projects that are exempt from this process and warns against submitting false or misleading information. The Central Empowered Committee has suggested various measures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, including obtaining environmental clearances before mining activity and cancelling leases in areas where plantations have been raised with international donor agency assistance.

The court order outlines conditions for mining in certain areas, including determining the optimum size of mines, proper stacking of overburden, afforestation, and identification of consultants for environmental impact assessments. The court also notes the importance of protecting the environment and the right to live in a pollution-free environment. The order discusses the legal parameters for mining and the responsibility of entrepreneurs to disclose potential environmental burdens. The court ultimately considers whether mining should be banned altogether or permitted with conditions, and notes the importance of complying with other statutory provisions for environmental protection.

The court order discusses the measures required to be taken by mining lease holders for the protection of the environment and control of pollution. It also refers to the National Forest Policy and the Aravalli range, which is an ancient mountain chain in India that has suffered severe environmental degradation. The Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDI) has conducted a study of environmental problems in the Aravalli hills and has recommended various actions for eco-restoration. The court order suggests that mining operations should be carried out on sustainable development principles and after obtaining due approvals under various statutory provisions. It also emphasizes the need for inter-departmental coordination, rehabilitation programs for abandoned mines, and regular monitoring to check compliance with environmental protection measures.

The court order discusses the environmental degradation caused by mining activities in the Aravalli range in India. The court suggests that a monitoring committee should be formed to examine individual mines from an environmental angle and file a report with recommendations for restarting or stopping mining activities. The court also clarifies that
