The Supreme Court of India recently issued a series of court orders related to the establishment of an industry within 10 km of the Osman Sagar and Himayaat Sagar lakes in Andhra Pradesh. The court upheld the orders of the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board to not grant consent to M/s. Surana Oils & Derivatives (India) Ltd. to establish its industry within the prohibited area. The court emphasized the need for scientific inputs before adjudicating complicated issues of pollution to the environment and referred to the precautionary principle and the new rule of burden of proof in the matter of environmental pollution.

The court also discussed the right to access to drinking water as a fundamental right and the concept of a healthy environment as a part of the fundamental right to life. The National Environmental Appellate Authority was asked to provide its opinion on the likelihood of serious pollution to the drinking water in the lakes if the industry was allowed to be established.

In another court order, the court referred a question to the National Environmental Appellate Authority regarding the adequacy of precautions suggested by the appellant Board for an industry seeking consent from the Pollution Control Boards. The industry had purchased land within 10 KM of reservoirs and applied for consent, despite a prohibition on industries within that distance. The State Government granted exemption from the prohibition, subject to proper control over treatment of waste. The appellant Board rejected the industry's application due to its presence on the hazardous "Red" list and the potential for pollution. The court sought expert opinions on the matter and ultimately heard arguments on the validity of the exemption granted by the Government.

The court considered several legal questions related to the case, including the permissibility of granting exemptions for individual industries in prohibited areas, the applicability of the principle of promissory estoppel, and the establishment of environmental courts. The court ultimately decided against the industry seeking permission to operate in a prohibited area.

In another court order, the court discussed the power of the Central and State Governments to issue directions to protect the environment, including the power to restrict areas where industries cannot operate. The State of Andhra Pradesh issued a notification prohibiting polluting industries within 10 km of two reservoirs, but later granted an exemption to a specific industry. The court ruled that this exemption was invalid and arbitrary, as it violated the right to clean water and ignored the potential danger of pollution to the lakes. The court emphasized the importance of the precautionary principle in protecting the environment and public health.

The court also noted that the exemption granted in GO 153 dated 3.7.97 is without statutory backing and violates Article 21. The court referred to the precautionary principle and the burden of proof, stating that the industry must establish that there would be no danger of pollution to the reservoirs. The court cited reports from the National Environmental Appellate Authority, Dr. Bhowmick of Bombay, and the NGRI, which all indicate that the industry is hazardous and has a high potential for pollution. The court ultimately decided against the industry seeking permission to operate in a prohibited area.

In another court order, the court discussed the findings of various reports regarding the potential danger posed by a chemical industry to two drinking water reservoirs. The reports suggest that there is a high risk of hazardous materials seeping into the earth and reaching the tanks, and that the safeguards suggested by the Pollution Control Board may not be adequate. The court concluded that the industry cannot be granted a NOC and that the principle of promissory estoppel cannot be applied in this case. The court also noted that the industry should not have proceeded with civil work without obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board.

The court also discussed various points related to environmental laws and regulations. It mentioned the need for constituting environmental courts and tribunals comprising of environmental scientists/experts as members. The court directed the State of Andhra Pradesh to identify and take action against polluting industries located within 10 km radius of two lakes. The appeal was allowed, and the order of the appellant board refusing permission to the seventh respondent under section 25 of the Water Act was restored. The court acknowledged the excellent reports submitted by three expert bodies and allowed them to submit their list of expenses or fee to the State of Andhra Pradesh. No costs were awarded, and the matter was listed after four months.

In summary, the court orders issued by the Supreme Court of India related to the establishment of an industry within 10 km of the Osman Sagar and Himayaat Sagar lakes in Andhra Pradesh emphasized the need for scientific inputs before adjudicating complicated issues of pollution to the environment. The court also discussed the right to access to drinking water as a fundamental right and the concept of a healthy environment as a part of the fundamental right to life. The court ultimately decided against the industry seeking permission to operate in a prohibited area and emphasized the importance of the precautionary principle in protecting the environment and public health. The court also directed the State of Andhra Pradesh to identify and take action against polluting industries located within 10 km radius of two lakes and acknowledged the need for constituting environmental courts and tribunals comprising of environmental scientists/experts as members.
