The case in question involves a revision petition filed by the accused petitioner against an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No. 1, Chittorgarh, in criminal case No. 110/99. The petitioner was charged with offences under Sections 40, 49 read with Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner had previously been discharged by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in a previous case on the same facts and circumstances.

The court held that the Additional Chief Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance and frame charges against the petitioner when he had already been discharged by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The order of taking cognizance and framing of charges were set aside, and the complaint filed by the SHO was quashed.

The court's decision was based on the principle of double jeopardy, which prohibits a person from being tried for the same offence twice. In this case, the petitioner had already been discharged by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and therefore, the Additional Chief Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance and frame charges against him.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of double jeopardy and ensures that individuals are not subjected to multiple trials for the same offence. It also highlights the importance of jurisdiction and the need for courts to exercise their powers within the limits prescribed by law.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that individuals are not subjected to arbitrary or unjust treatment by the legal system.
