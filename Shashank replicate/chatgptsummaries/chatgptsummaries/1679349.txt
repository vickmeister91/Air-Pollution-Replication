The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Praveen Kumar against the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and another party. The petitioner had sought permission to sell Pan, Bidi, Cigarettes, etc. near Baroda House, Copernicus Marg, New Delhi. However, the Thareja Committee rejected the petitioner's case for failure to prove continuous squatting for a short period of two years, in the entire span of over 10 years. The court found that the NDMC had duly considered the recommendations made by the Thareja Committee and reached a conclusion that toleration permission for use was not warranted in this case. The challenge to the rejection failed, and the writ petition was dismissed.

The petitioner had argued that he had been selling Pan, Bidi, Cigarettes, etc. in the area for over 10 years and had been paying rent to the NDMC. He claimed that he had been continuously squatting in the area for the past two years and was entitled to toleration permission. However, the Thareja Committee rejected his case, stating that he had failed to prove continuous squatting for a short period of two years.

The court found that the Thareja Committee had considered all the relevant factors and had reached a reasonable conclusion. The court noted that the Thareja Committee had taken into account the fact that the petitioner had been paying rent to the NDMC for the use of the land. However, the court also noted that the Thareja Committee had found that the petitioner had failed to prove continuous squatting for a short period of two years.

The court further noted that the NDMC had considered the recommendations made by the Thareja Committee and had reached a conclusion that toleration permission for use was not warranted in this case. The court found that the NDMC had acted in accordance with the law and had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously.

The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that he was entitled to toleration permission under the Delhi Squatter's Act. The court noted that the Delhi Squatter's Act only applied to land that was not owned by the government. In this case, the land in question was owned by the NDMC, and therefore, the Delhi Squatter's Act did not apply.

In conclusion, the court found that the petitioner had failed to prove continuous squatting for a short period of two years, in the entire span of over 10 years. The court also found that the NDMC had duly considered the recommendations made by the Thareja Committee and had reached a conclusion that toleration permission for use was not warranted in this case. The challenge to the rejection failed, and the writ petition was dismissed.
