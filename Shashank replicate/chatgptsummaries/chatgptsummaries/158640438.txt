The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over land ownership in various areas of Andhra Pradesh. In the first case, the petitioner filed a writ petition requesting the court to issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or order directing the respondents to act in accordance with law and to give effect to the orders passed by the then Settlement Officer in R.C.No.10/70-B, dated 23.08.1977, and consequently, release and restore the land of an extent of Acs.450.00 cents to the petitioner in terms of the said order. The case pertains to the ownership of land in Survey No.11 of Machupalli Shotriyam Village, Khajipet Mandal, Kadapa District, which was illegally included in a proposed Reserve Forest Block by the Forest Department of the State. The petitioner's ancestors purchased Acs.1450.00 cents of land in Survey No.11 of Machupalli Shotriyam Village, Khajipet Mandal, Kadapa District, from the then Shotriyamdars during the period 1946-1955. The Forest Settlement Officer had passed orders directing deletion of the said extent of Acs.450.00 cents of land, which was erroneously included in the Reserve Forest Block. The said order was set aside in appeal by the District Judge, Kadapa, by an order, dated 17.06.1976, in Appeal No.3 of 1975, and the matter was remanded for fresh consideration by the Forest Settlement Officer. After remand, the then Forest Settlement Officer again passed orders, dated 23.08.1977, to the effect that if the land of Acs.450.00 cents is to be retained in the Forest Block, the same requires to be acquired within three months, and failing which, the land should be eliminated from the Reserve Forest Block.

In the second case, the court order discusses a dispute over land in Machupalli Village that was acquired by the government in 1958 and classified as "Forest". The Forest Settlement Officer received claims from Hanumantha Reddy in 1974, but the court found that the land had already been acquired and the claims could not be settled under the Act of 1967. The court also notes that surveying in Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary requires permission from the Government of India. The order provides details of the survey numbers and areas of the land in question. The final notification of the block under Section 15 is under process.

The third court order pertains to the ownership of land in the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary. The order states that an area of land was transferred to the government and falls within the sanctuary, but the ancestors of the petitioner claim to have purchased a portion of it. However, they failed to produce documents to support their claim. The Forest Settlement Officer had declared them as the real owners of the entire block, but the Divisional Forest Officer filed an appeal stating that the claims were made after the prescribed period and the Forest Settlement Officer had no right to consider the claim after 2 Â½ years. The court ruled that the order of the Forest Settlement Officer was null and void, and the further proceedings will not bind the authorities as the matter does not come under the purview of the A.P. Forest Act.

In the fourth court order, the court states that the Forest Settlement Officer's order is null and void as they did not follow the prescribed period under the A.P. Forest Act. The Estate Abolition Tribunal can only consider claims under the Estate Abolition Act, not the A.P. Forest Act. The rights of the ancestors of the petitioner and the petitioner are extinct. The land in question belongs to the government and is classified as forest as per village accounts. The petitioner has not obtained any authorized ryotwari patta for the lands claimed. The writ petition is dismissed.

In the fifth court order, the court dismisses a writ petition filed by a petitioner claiming ownership of land in Machupalli village. The petitioner's ancestors had purchased the land but did not obtain a ryotwari patta under the Estates Abolition Act. The land was later included in a proposed reserve forest block, and the petitioner's father filed a claim petition before the Forest Settlement Officer. The Officer eventually passed an order in favor of the petitioner's father, which was confirmed by the Estates Abolition Tribunal. However, the court finds that the petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the writ petition, and even if the order of the Forest Settlement Officer is valid, no appropriate steps were taken within a reasonable time for its implementation. The court also notes that the petitioner suppressed relevant facts in the case.

Finally, the sixth court order discusses the importance of disclosing all relevant facts when approaching the court for relief. It cites several cases where the court dismissed petitions due to suppression of material facts or inordinate delay in seeking relief. The court also emphasizes that a writ of mandamus is discretionary and not a right, and may be denied if a party's claim is unduly belated due to laches. The court ultimately dismisses the present writ petition due to suppression of material facts and inordinate delay in seeking relief. The court order cites previous cases to support the doctrine of constructive res judicata in writ petitions. It also states
