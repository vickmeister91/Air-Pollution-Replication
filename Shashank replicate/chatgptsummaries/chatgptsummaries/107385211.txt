On March 17, 2015, Judge Sneh Prashar dismissed a revision petition filed by Ombir alias Sonu against the rejection of his application to summon the case diary by the Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. The petitioner's counsel argued that summoning the police file was essential for just and proper adjudication of the case. However, the court found no ground for intervention in the order of the trial court and dismissed the revision.

The court order pertains to the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. related to the production of police diaries in court during an inquiry or trial. This section mandates that every police officer in charge of a police station shall maintain a daily diary in the prescribed form, which shall contain a record of all important occurrences in the police station. The diary is considered to be an official record of the police station and is admissible as evidence in court.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought to summon the case diary to aid in the adjudication of the case. However, the court found that the trial court had already considered the relevant evidence and had come to a reasoned conclusion. The court noted that the trial court had relied on the testimony of the witnesses and had considered the evidence on record before arriving at its decision. Therefore, the court found no ground for intervention in the order of the trial court.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of judicial review, which require that the court should not interfere with the decisions of lower courts unless there is a clear error of law or fact. The court's role is to ensure that the lower courts have followed the correct legal procedures and have arrived at a reasoned decision based on the evidence on record.

In conclusion, the court order dismisses a revision made by the trial court. The court found no ground for intervention in the order of the trial court and dismissed the revision. The court also discussed the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. related to the production of police diaries in court during an inquiry or trial. The court's decision is in line with the principles of judicial review, which require that the court should not interfere with the decisions of lower courts unless there is a clear error of law or fact.
