In the first court order, The Dalmia Magnesite Corporation filed a writ petition requesting a writ of mandamus forbidding the State of Tamil Nadu and the Regional Transport Officer from preventing or interfering with the use of their private service vehicle to transport the children of their employees to school. The petitioner argued that the use of the vehicle for this purpose did not violate any provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act or the conditions of their permit. However, the respondents argued that the permit was only for the transportation of office staff from the company to their residence and that the transportation of school children violated the permit conditions. The court ultimately agreed with the respondents and dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order requires that all vehicles used by educational institutions must have a first aid box, horizontal grills on windows, fire extinguishers, reliable locking facilities on doors, and be clearly marked with the school's name and telephone number. The transport department and police officials must periodically check for overloading, over-speeding, and intoxicated drivers. The vehicles must also comply with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of M.C.Mehta -VS- Union of India. The vehicles carrying school children may be required to have a particular color, to be determined by the state. Violations of the order can be reported to the court. The court also dismissed a writ petition seeking relief for a company that was not allowed to use its staff bus to transport children to school, stating that no mandamus can be issued in violation of statutory provisions.

The first court order dealt with a writ petition filed by The Dalmia Magnesite Corporation, which sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the State of Tamil Nadu and the Regional Transport Officer from interfering with the use of their private service vehicle to transport the children of their employees to school. The petitioner argued that the use of the vehicle for this purpose did not violate any provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act or the conditions of their permit. However, the respondents argued that the permit was only for the transportation of office staff from the company to their residence and that the transportation of school children violated the permit conditions. The court ultimately agreed with the respondents and dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order dealt with the safety of vehicles used by educational institutions to transport school children. The court ordered that all such vehicles must have a first aid box, horizontal grills on windows, fire extinguishers, reliable locking facilities on doors, and be clearly marked with the school's name and telephone number. The transport department and police officials must periodically check for overloading, over-speeding, and intoxicated drivers. The vehicles must also comply with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of M.C.Mehta -VS- Union of India. The vehicles carrying school children may be required to have a particular color, to be determined by the state. Violations of the order can be reported to the court.

The court also dismissed a writ petition seeking relief for a company that was not allowed to use its staff bus to transport children to school, stating that no mandamus can be issued in violation of statutory provisions. This means that the court cannot issue an order that goes against the law. In this case, the company's staff bus was not permitted to transport school children because it violated the conditions of the permit. The court upheld this decision and dismissed the writ petition.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following the rules and regulations when it comes to the transportation of school children. The first court order shows that even if a company believes that they are not violating any laws or permit conditions, they may still be held accountable if they are found to be in violation. The second court order emphasizes the need for safety measures to be in place when transporting school children and the consequences of violating these measures. It is important for all parties involved to prioritize the safety and well-being of school children when it comes to transportation.
