The court has issued three separate orders pertaining to Ashok Kumar Chhabra and his company, s. Ashok Chhabra & Co., regarding the operation of hot mix plants in Delhi. The first order pertains to a contempt petition against Ashok Kumar Chhabra for willful violation of orders passed by the Supreme Court regarding the closure and relocation of hot mix plants in Delhi. The court had directed 43 hot mix plants to stop functioning and operating in Delhi from February 28, 1997, and had allotted alternative sites for relocation. Despite this, Chhabra continued to operate his unit in Delhi, leading to the sealing of his unit by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Chhabra's appeal against the sealing order was dismissed by the Appellate Authority and the High Court of Delhi. The Supreme Court observed that the pendency of Chhabra's writ petition in the High Court did not affect its orders regarding hot mix plants in Delhi.

The second order pertains to a writ petition filed by s. Ashok Chhabra & Co. in the High Court of Delhi, which has been pending since 1998. The court has ordered that the writ petition be heard and disposed of within two months. The court has also directed the closure of the company's Hot Mix Plants, which have been declared hazardous by an expert committee. The company has been found to be in contempt of court for continuing to operate the plants despite earlier orders to close them down. The court has rejected the company's defense and apology, stating that the apology is not a product of remorse or contrition.

The third order rejected an apology and found Ashok Kumar Chhabra guilty of contempt of court for violating orders and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, causing harm to society. The court imposed a one-week simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs.one lakh, with half going to the Delhi Pollution Control Board and half to the amicus curiae who assisted the court. The court hopes to send a strong signal to prevent similar violations in the future.

The court's orders highlight the importance of following environmental regulations and court orders to protect public health and the environment. The court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on Chhabra sends a strong message to other violators that such actions will not be tolerated. The court's decision to hear and dispose of the writ petition within two months also shows the court's commitment to resolving environmental disputes in a timely manner.

The court's orders also highlight the need for effective enforcement of environmental regulations. Despite the court's earlier orders to close down the hot mix plants, Chhabra continued to operate his unit, leading to harm to society and the environment. The court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on Chhabra is a step towards ensuring that environmental regulations are effectively enforced.

In conclusion, the court's orders regarding Ashok Kumar Chhabra and his company highlight the importance of following environmental regulations and court orders to protect public health and the environment. The court's decision to impose a fine and imprisonment on Chhabra sends a strong message to other violators that such actions will not be tolerated.
