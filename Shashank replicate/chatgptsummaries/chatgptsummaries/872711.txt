The court order in question pertains to a second appeal against a judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge, Nadia in a title appeal. The plaintiff had brought a suit against the defendant for eviction under the provisions of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act on grounds of default and reasonable requirement for building and re-building. The trial court dismissed the suit on both grounds, but the first appeal court decreed the suit and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court on the ground of default. The second appeal questions whether the first appeal court committed any legal error in coming to a finding that the defendant is a defaulter.

The court finds that the first appeal court erred in law in holding that the defendant is a defaulter after coming to a finding that there was no valid tender for the initial deposit of the rent for the month of Aswin, 1384 B.S. The evidence on record does not justify the first appeal court to come to such a finding in favour of the plaintiff/respondent.
