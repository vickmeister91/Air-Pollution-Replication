The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Rajesh Aggarwal against the State of Delhi and Pran Pahuja. The dispute was related to the sale and purchase of shares, and the revisionist had filed a complaint case for registration of an FIR. The court had issued a summons to produce contract notes, which the revisionist claimed were not in his possession. The court then issued a search warrant, but no documents were found. The revisionist was then summoned again to produce the contract notes, and the impugned order directed him to give an explanation for not producing them. The revisionist challenged this order, arguing that no summons to produce documents can be issued against an accused before his summoning in a complaint case. 

The court did not address this issue but discussed the provisions of section 91 of the Cr.P.C, which deals with summons to produce documents or other things. The court order states that if a person fails to produce a document or thing as required by a summons or requisition, a search warrant can be issued. In this case, the revisionist failed to produce contract notes and search warrants were issued, but the documents could not be found. 

The court finds that seeking an explanation from the revisionist before taking cognizance of the offense is against the purpose of pre-summoning evidence. The order is set aside, and the case is directed to proceed as per law. The court order highlights the importance of following the legal procedures and the provisions of the Cr.P.C. in criminal cases.
