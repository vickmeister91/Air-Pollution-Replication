The Punjab State Board for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution filed a complaint against M/s Panna Synthetics Pvt. Ltd. and others for running a business without obtaining the necessary consent for discharging trade effluent. The accused failed to comply with the directions of the Board and did not install an effluent treatment plant. The accused were summoned to face trial and were charged under Section 44 read with Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The trial court framed points for determination and after appraisal of the evidence, found the accused guilty of the offence.

In a subsequent court order, it was stated that the trial court found only one person, Vineet Aggarwal, to be responsible for managing the company and that the prosecution failed to prove the liability of the other accused. The trial court also concluded that the accused had applied for consent, but it had not been decided within four months, and therefore, the consent would be deemed to have been given unconditionally. As a result, the complaint was dismissed, and the accused were acquitted of the charges.

The appellant board filed an appeal, arguing that the industry was set up without the board's consent, which is punishable under Sections 44 and 47 of the Act. The respondents argued that the consent was deemed to have been given as the application was not refused within four months. The court considered both arguments and reviewed Section 25 of the Act to make a decision.

The court order outlines the procedures and conditions for obtaining consent from the State Board for establishing or altering an industry, operation, or process that involves the discharge of sewage or effluent. The State Board may grant consent subject to certain conditions, refuse consent, or impose conditions on establishments that have been established without consent. The order also requires the State Board to maintain a register of conditions imposed and allows for the automatic granting of consent after four months of a complete application. The order defines terms such as "new or altered outlet" and "new discharge."

In another court order, a case involving a company accused of discharging effluent without the approval of the Board was discussed. The court found that the company had applied for consent and had not been refused within the required time frame, and that the company had since been closed. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that it was without merit.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of obtaining consent from the State Board for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution before establishing or altering an industry, operation, or process that involves the discharge of sewage or effluent. Failure to obtain consent can result in legal action and penalties under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court orders also emphasize the need for the State Board to maintain a register of conditions imposed and to review applications for consent within a timely manner.
