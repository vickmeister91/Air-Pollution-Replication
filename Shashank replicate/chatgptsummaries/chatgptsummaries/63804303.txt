The Bombay High Court recently heard and decided on four petitions challenging an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, 62nd Court, Dadar, Mumbai, issuing process under various sections of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, 2000. The petitioners, who were accused, challenged the order on the grounds that the Bandra Worli Sea Link Project, which they were involved in, had received environmental clearance and that the increase in vehicular traffic was beyond their control. The complainant argued that the increase in traffic had led to abnormal levels of air and noise pollution, which were beyond the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The court reserved its judgment on February 13, 2019, and pronounced it on May 2, 2019. The court order pertains to a complaint filed against several parties for violating noise and air pollution regulations. The complainant relied on studies conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and noise monitoring conducted by one of the accused parties. The court found that the noise pollution had exceeded prescribed levels and was a direct result of traffic movement. The accused parties had not complied with an order passed by the National Green Tribunal and had ignored notices issued by the complainant. The court issued process against certain accused parties for offenses punishable under various sections and rules related to environmental protection and noise pollution regulation. The accused parties challenged the order, arguing that no offense was made out against them.

Another court order discusses arguments made by both the prosecution and defense in a case related to noise pollution. The defense argues that no offense has been committed and that the National Green Tribunal does not have jurisdiction. They also argue that the notice given is deficient and that the complaint is vague. The prosecution argues that the accused have not complied with the National Green Tribunal's orders and that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued directions to check pollution levels. The court considers both arguments and will make a decision based on the evidence presented.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has directed the Traffic Commissioner to check the pollution levels of vehicles on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link for compliance with BS-IV standards. The complainant alleges that the Traffic Department has not taken sufficient measures to control pollution and noise pollution caused by vehicles on the Sea Link. The accused have failed to comply with relevant provisions of environmental protection rules and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The complainant has given notice of intent to file a complaint under the Act, but it is unclear if the notice was properly addressed. The court is considering whether to issue process.

The court order discusses the sections of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and relevant rules that pertain to preventing and controlling environmental pollution. The accused, who are officers, are not involved in any manufacturing or operation that causes pollution, so certain sections of the Act cannot be applied to them. The court also notes the seriousness of protecting the environment and the penalties for contravention of the Act. The court analyzes the sections under which the learned Magistrate has issued process and concludes that the accused cannot be held responsible under those sections.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Environment Protection Act and Noise Pollution Regulation Control Rules. It clarifies that Section 17 of the Act applies to government departments violating environmental laws, but not to members of appraisal committees or assessment authorities. The order also states that vehicular traffic cannot be considered an industry, process, or operation under the Act, and therefore certain rules do not apply. The complaint in question was filed against various individuals and legal entities for failing to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal in penalizing non-compliance with its orders. The court notes that while the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with criminal cases, it does have penal powers for non-compliance or disobedience of its orders. The court also highlights the importance of Section 26 of the National Green Tribunal Act, which gives the Tribunal the power to impose penalties for non-compliance with its orders. The court further notes that the efficacious remedy available to the complainant is under section 26 of the Act. The court also discusses an order of the National Green Tribunal regarding noise pollution and the implementation of its orders by various authorities.

The court order discusses the use of inherent powers by the High Court to quash and set aside criminal proceedings. The court cites various judgments to establish that the Magistrate should consider the complaint and other documents relied upon by the complainant while issuing process, and that the High Court should use its powers to do justice and stop unnecessary criminal litigations when no specific offense is made out. The court also notes that the National Green Tribunal's orders were followed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and that various authorities took steps to comply with the orders. The court finds the allegations made in the complaint to be vague and concludes that no specific offense is constituted against the petitioners.

The court order states that the accused parties, MPCB and Environment Department, have taken steps to control air and noise pollution as per the order of the National Green Tribunal. However, the complainant suggests that monitoring of PUC and honking is necessary to control pollution. The court also notes that specific allegations are necessary to issue process against any person in criminal law. The petitioners, MSRDC, were not parties in the National Green Tribunal case and there is no material
