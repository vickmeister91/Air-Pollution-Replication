The court order pertains to a bail application filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner in this case is accused of offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution's case is that the accused persons were found dealing with a quantity of snake poison that was intended to be sold for a large sum of money. The petitioner was arrested and remanded to judicial custody.

The court, while considering the bail application, took into account various factors such as the duration of judicial custody, the nature of the offence, and the fact that other accused were released on bail. After considering all these factors, the court granted bail to the petitioner subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was based on several factors. Firstly, the court took into account the duration of judicial custody that the petitioner had already undergone. The court observed that the petitioner had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that this was a relevant factor to be considered while deciding the bail application.

Secondly, the court considered the nature of the offence that the petitioner was accused of. The court observed that the offence under the Wild Life Protection Act was a serious offence and that the petitioner's involvement in the offence could not be taken lightly. However, the court also noted that the petitioner was not the main accused in the case and that there were other accused who had already been released on bail.

Thirdly, the court took into account the fact that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and that there was no likelihood of the petitioner absconding or tampering with evidence. The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had not hindered the progress of the case in any way.

Based on these factors, the court granted bail to the petitioner subject to certain conditions. The conditions included the petitioner furnishing a personal bond and surety, reporting to the police station regularly, and not leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner is in line with the principles of natural justice and the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court has taken into account all relevant factors while deciding the bail application and has ensured that the petitioner is not denied his right to personal liberty without just cause.

In conclusion, the court's order granting bail to the petitioner in this case is a well-reasoned and balanced decision that takes into account all relevant factors. The court has ensured that the petitioner's right to personal liberty is protected while also ensuring that the interests of justice are served.
