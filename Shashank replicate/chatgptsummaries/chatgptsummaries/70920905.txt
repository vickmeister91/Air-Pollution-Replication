The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. by Baljit Singh against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petition was filed against the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Khetiya, District Badwani in MJC No.07/2008 rejecting the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for producing the record of alleged supurdginama and relevant papers.

The applicant, Baljit Singh, claimed that he was not the person to whom the vehicle was given on interim custody and filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to prove his innocence. The court allowed the petition and directed the Trial Court to call for the record containing the original supurdginama and ascertain whether the applicant Baljit Singh is the person to whom the vehicle was given on interim custody or not.

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice.

The order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class had rejected Baljit Singh's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for producing the record of alleged supurdginama and relevant papers.

The court, while allowing Baljit Singh's petition, directed the Trial Court to call for the record containing the original supurdginama and ascertain whether the applicant Baljit Singh is the person to whom the vehicle was given on interim custody or not. This direction was given to ensure that the ends of justice are served and that the process of the court is not abused.

The court's order in this case highlights the importance of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. in ensuring that the truth is revealed in any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the principles of justice and fairness in any legal proceeding.
