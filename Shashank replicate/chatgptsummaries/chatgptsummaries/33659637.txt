In a recent court order, an anticipatory bail application filed by Ananta Bera and Chitaranjan Patar was dismissed in connection with a case related to the killing of a leopard in 2007. The court stated that since the case was instituted against unknown persons in 2007 and the petitioners were named in 2010, the anticipatory bail application filed in 2014 was belated and not entertained. The court advised the petitioners to surrender in the court below and apply for regular bail.

The case in question dates back to 2007 when a leopard was killed in the area. The case was initially instituted against unknown persons, and it was only in 2010 that the petitioners were named in the case. The petitioners then filed an anticipatory bail application in 2014, which was dismissed by the court on the grounds of being belated.

The court's decision to dismiss the anticipatory bail application was based on the fact that the petitioners had waited too long to file their application. The court stated that the delay in filing the application was not justified, given that the case had been ongoing for several years and the petitioners had been named in the case for four years prior to filing the application.

The court's decision to dismiss the application and advise the petitioners to surrender and apply for regular bail is in line with the legal principles governing anticipatory bail. Anticipatory bail is granted to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offence, and it is meant to provide protection to the person against whom the case has been registered. However, the grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, and one of these conditions is that the application must be filed at the earliest possible opportunity.

In this case, the court found that the petitioners had not filed their application at the earliest possible opportunity, and therefore, the application was not entertained. The court's decision to advise the petitioners to surrender and apply for regular bail is also in line with the legal principles governing bail. Bail is granted to a person who has been arrested and is awaiting trial, and it is meant to provide temporary relief to the person until the trial is completed.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the anticipatory bail application filed by Ananta Bera and Chitaranjan Patar in connection with a case related to the killing of a leopard in 2007 was based on the fact that the application was belated. The court advised the petitioners to surrender in the court below and apply for regular bail. This decision is in line with the legal principles governing anticipatory bail and bail, and it underscores the importance of filing applications at the earliest possible opportunity.
