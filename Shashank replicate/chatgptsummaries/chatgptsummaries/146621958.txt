The Indian court has issued a notice to the respondents in a writ petition challenging provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act. The notice is returnable on June 26, 2013, and the Attorney General of India has also been issued a notice. The petitioners have been directed to serve a copy of the writ-application to the respondents. The court has granted liberty to pray for interim relief after service upon the respondents. The matter has been tagged with similar writ-applications and listed together on the returnable date.

The writ petition challenges the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, which was enacted in 2010 to provide for the establishment of a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The petitioners argue that the Act is unconstitutional as it violates the basic structure of the Constitution and the principles of separation of powers and independence of the judiciary.

The petitioners contend that the Act gives excessive powers to the executive and the central government, which can interfere with the functioning of the tribunal and compromise its independence. They also argue that the Act violates the principles of natural justice and fair play as it allows the central government to appoint and remove the members of the tribunal without any consultation with the judiciary or the civil society.

The court has taken cognizance of the petition and issued notices to the respondents, including the Attorney General of India, who is the chief legal advisor to the government. The court has also directed the petitioners to serve a copy of the writ-application to the respondents and granted them liberty to pray for interim relief after service upon the respondents.

The court has tagged the writ petition with similar writ-applications challenging the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act and listed them together on the returnable date. This indicates that the court is taking a serious view of the matter and wants to hear all the arguments and submissions before passing any order.

The National Green Tribunal Act was enacted in 2010 to provide for the establishment of a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the constitution of a National Green Tribunal and several regional benches to hear and dispose of cases relating to environmental disputes.

The Act also provides for the appointment of the members of the tribunal, who are required to have expertise in environmental matters and are appointed by the central government in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. The Act empowers the tribunal to hear and dispose of cases relating to environmental disputes, including disputes arising out of the implementation of laws relating to water, air, and land pollution, and the conservation of forests and other natural resources.

The Act has been hailed as a significant step towards the protection of the environment and the conservation of natural resources. However, it has also been criticized for giving excessive powers to the executive and the central government, which can interfere with the functioning of the tribunal and compromise its independence.

The writ petition challenging the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act raises important questions about the balance of power between the executive, the judiciary, and the civil society in matters relating to environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. The court's decision in this matter will have far-reaching implications for the future of environmental governance in India.

In conclusion, the court's decision to issue notices to the respondents in the writ petition challenging the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act is a significant development in the ongoing debate about the balance of power between the executive, the judiciary, and the civil society in matters relating to environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. The court's decision to hear all the arguments and submissions before passing any order indicates that it is taking a serious view of the matter and wants to ensure that justice is done. The outcome of this case will have far-reaching implications for the future of environmental governance in India and will be closely watched by all stakeholders.
