The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Virendra Singh and his sons, challenging the rejection of their application for payment of Rs. 25,000 under the no-fault liability provision of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The application was rejected on the grounds that the establishment was not registered as per statutory rules and the accident did not fall under the category defined in the Act. The court found no error in the decision and dismissed the petition, suggesting that the petitioners may claim damages through tort law.

The Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 was enacted to provide for public liability insurance for the purpose of providing immediate relief to the persons affected by accidents occurring while handling hazardous substances. The Act provides for the payment of compensation to victims of accidents involving hazardous substances, irrespective of fault. The Act also provides for the establishment of a public liability insurance pool, which is to be managed by an authority appointed by the central government.

In the present case, Virendra Singh and his sons had applied for compensation under the no-fault liability provision of the Act, which provides for the payment of compensation to victims of accidents involving hazardous substances, irrespective of fault. However, their application was rejected on the grounds that the establishment was not registered as per statutory rules and the accident did not fall under the category defined in the Act.

The court, upon hearing the petition, found no error in the decision to reject the application. The court noted that the establishment in question was not registered as per statutory rules, and therefore, did not fall under the purview of the Act. The court also noted that the accident did not fall under the category defined in the Act, and therefore, the petitioners were not entitled to compensation under the no-fault liability provision of the Act.

The court, however, did suggest that the petitioners may claim damages through tort law. Tort law is a branch of civil law that deals with the compensation of victims of wrongful acts or omissions. The court noted that the petitioners may be entitled to compensation under tort law, if they can prove that the accident was caused by the negligence of the establishment in question.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Virendra Singh and his sons, challenging the rejection of their application for payment of Rs. 25,000 under the no-fault liability provision of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. The court found no error in the decision to reject the application, as the establishment in question was not registered as per statutory rules and the accident did not fall under the category defined in the Act. The court suggested that the petitioners may claim damages through tort law, if they can prove that the accident was caused by the negligence of the establishment in question.
