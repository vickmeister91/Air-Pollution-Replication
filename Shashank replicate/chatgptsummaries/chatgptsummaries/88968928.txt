The court order pertains to a suit for mandatory injunction filed by Sh. Mohan Lal Aggarwal against the Govt. of NCT Delhi and D.S.I.I.D.C Ltd. The plaintiff had applied for an industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries sponsored by the defendant no.1. The plaintiff was found eligible for allotment of an industrial plot and was granted plot no.41, but it was later cancelled. The plaintiff filed a suit for mandatory injunction, directing the defendants to restore the eligibility of the plaintiff unit for allotment of an alternative industrial plot under the relocation scheme of industries.

The defendant no.1 did not file any reply/written statement to the suit of the plaintiff, and defendant no.2 filed a written statement denying the contentions made in the suit. The court heard both parties and made findings on the issues raised.

The court order states that the plaintiff's request for restoration of his allotment of plot under the relocation scheme of industries has been declined. The defendant no.2 had cancelled the plaintiff's allotment and restricted his entitlement to a 100 square meter industrial plot. The plaintiff had applied for a refund of the amount deposited by him for the allotment of the plot, which was duly considered and refunded to him. The plaintiff had withdrawn from the scheme after taking the refund of the earnest money, and hence, he is not entitled to restoration of the allotment of the plot.

The court dismissed the plaintiff's suit, and no order was given as to cost.
