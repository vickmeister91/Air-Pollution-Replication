Dr. C R Nagaraj had filed a criminal appeal against the acquittal of S M Dinesh in a case of dishonored cheques. The complainant had alleged that the accused had taken a loan of Rs. 2 lakhs and another sum of Rs. 1,70,000/- from him with a promise to repay within six months, but the cheques issued by the accused were dishonored. The learned Magistrate had acquitted the accused on the ground that the complainant had not proved the pre-existence of debt and that the complainant had not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused.

However, the High Court remitted the matter to the trial court with a direction to take the documents produced by the complainant on record and provide an opportunity to both parties to establish their case. The court allowed the complainant's application under section 91 of the Cr.PC and set aside the previous order and judgment. The matter was remitted to the learned Magistrate with a direction to allow the complainant to mark the documents produced and lead further evidence. The accused was also given an opportunity to examine the complainant. The learned Magistrate was directed to proceed with the case in accordance with the law.
