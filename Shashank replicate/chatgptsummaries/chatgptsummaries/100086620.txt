In a recent court order, the issue at hand was a criminal case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Forest Department had seized a vehicle, and the registered owner of the vehicle had moved an application for interim custody. However, this application was dismissed by both the Magistrate and the Additional Sessions Judge. 

The petitioner then referred to two judgments passed by the Supreme Court, which held that Section 39(1)(d) of the Act cannot be made operational during the pendency of the trial. Additionally, the release of the vehicle cannot be refused solely on the ground that the property or the vehicle has been confiscated. 

Taking these judgments into account, the court quashed and set aside the previous orders and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to consider the application afresh, if filed by the petitioner under Section 50(4) of the Act. The court also imposed certain conditions for the release of the vehicle. 

This court order highlights the importance of following established legal precedents and ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected. The Supreme Court judgments cited by the petitioner were crucial in this case, as they clarified the limitations of Section 39(1)(d) of the Act and emphasized the importance of not denying the release of property or vehicles solely on the basis of confiscation. 

Furthermore, the court's decision to remand the matter to the trial court with directions to consider the application afresh demonstrates the importance of due process and fair treatment in legal proceedings. By imposing certain conditions for the release of the vehicle, the court also ensured that the petitioner would not be able to use the vehicle for any illegal activities related to the original criminal case. 

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding legal precedents and ensuring that individuals are treated fairly in legal proceedings. By following established legal principles and procedures, the court was able to make a just and equitable decision in this case.
