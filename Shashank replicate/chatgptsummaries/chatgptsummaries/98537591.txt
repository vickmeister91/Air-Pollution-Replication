The Punjab and Haryana High Court in Chandigarh issued a court order on January 15, 2015, involving various petitioners and the State of Haryana and another respondent. The court order pertains to 11 writ petitions involving a common question of law and facts. However, no details about the cases or the court's decision are provided.

One of the cases involves M/s Esteem Infra Build Private Limited and the State of Haryana. The State had advertised an auction of minor mineral units in Panchkula, Ambala, and Kurukshetra. The petitioner participated in the auction and was declared the successful bidder. However, after the demarcation of the area, it was found that 140.02 hectares were missing, reducing the actual area auctioned to 255.41 hectares. The petitioner requested a corrected letter of intent, but the respondents rejected the request. The court will dispose of this case along with the other 10 writ petitions.

Another case involves a petitioner seeking a refund for a quarry auctioned to them, claiming misrepresentation of the area. The respondent argues that the petitioner did not adhere to the terms and conditions of the auction notice and letter of intent. The court addresses the issue of maintainability of the writ petition and concludes that the availability of an alternative remedy of appeal does not operate as a bar. The court also cites previous judgments that allow intervention by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India if the state or its instrumentality acts arbitrarily in a matter of contract.

In another case, the petitioner won an auction for a mining quarry, but the demarcation of the area was carried out after the auction, resulting in a reduction of the total area auctioned. The petitioner argues that they should be refunded the proportionate amount for the reduced area or a fresh auction should be carried out. The respondents argue that the petitioner did not execute the contract agreement and therefore no relief can be granted. The court finds that the respondents are not justified in demanding the auction amount for the original area when the actual area on the spot after demarcation was found to be less. The respondents are estopped from charging the petitioner for the original area and cannot take advantage of their own wrong.

The court order directs the respondents to specify the total area within the "had-bast" where quarrying is allowed and to demarcate the area by "khasra numbers". The court also cites a previous case where a seller forfeited earnest money due to a buyer's refusal to deposit the balance amount, stating that such action is unjustified. The court further notes that the respondents have incorporated new khasra numbers and changed the area without the petitioner's knowledge, which is not permitted. Additionally, the court mentions that forest land cannot be auctioned for mining purposes without prior approval and sanction of the Central Government.

The court order states that the provisions made for the conservation of forests and matters connected to it must apply to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification. The term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in government records. The court directs that all non-forest activities within any forest in any state throughout the country must cease without prior approval of the Central Government. The court quashes an impugned order and directs the respondents to conduct a fresh auction of quarries after conducting a proper survey and demarcation of the area to be auctioned. The amount charged from the petitioner in the present case must be refunded without any forfeiture, recovery, or penalty. All proceedings undertaken pursuant to the impugned order are set aside.

In summary, the court order issued by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Chandigarh on January 15, 2015, involves various petitioners and the State of Haryana and another respondent. The court order pertains to 11 writ petitions involving a common question of law and facts. The cases involve issues related to the auction of minor mineral units, misrepresentation of the area, and the demarcation of the area after the auction. The court directs the respondents to conduct a fresh auction of quarries after conducting a proper survey and demarcation of the area to be auctioned. The court also notes that forest land cannot be auctioned for mining purposes without prior approval and sanction of the Central Government. The court order sets aside all proceedings undertaken pursuant to the impugned order and directs the refund of the amount charged from the petitioner in the present case without any forfeiture, recovery, or penalty.
