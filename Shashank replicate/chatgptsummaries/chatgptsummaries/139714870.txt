The case of T. Naseer v. XLVIII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge in Bengaluru involved a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the judge and impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness, Yogananda. The petitioner claimed that Yogananda was a rowdy sheeter and a communal goonda, and sought to call for documents to support this claim. However, the Trial Court rejected the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The petitioner then approached the High Court, arguing that he was not precluded from seeking the summoning of documents under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage. The High Court agreed with the petitioner and held that he had the right to seek summoning of the document sought under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court disposed of the petition without prejudice to the petitioner's right to seek summoning of the document.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner sought to use this provision to challenge the order passed by the Trial Court and impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness.

The Trial Court had rejected the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which allows a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The petitioner had sought to call for documents to demonstrate that Yogananda was a rowdy sheeter and a communal goonda, which would have undermined his credibility as a witness.

The High Court, however, held that the petitioner was not precluded from seeking the summoning of documents under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage. Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the evidence of the accused, and allows the accused to produce evidence in support of his defence. The High Court held that the petitioner could seek the summoning of documents under this provision, which would allow him to challenge the credibility of the prosecution witness.

The court disposed of the petition without prejudice to the petitioner's right to seek summoning of the document sought under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. This means that the petitioner can still seek the summoning of documents under this provision, but he also has the option of seeking the summoning of documents under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage.

In conclusion, the case of T. Naseer v. XLVIII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge in Bengaluru involved a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the judge and impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness. The Trial Court rejected the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., but the High Court held that the petitioner was not precluded from seeking the summoning of documents under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage. The court disposed of the petition without prejudice to the petitioner's right to seek summoning of the document sought under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.
