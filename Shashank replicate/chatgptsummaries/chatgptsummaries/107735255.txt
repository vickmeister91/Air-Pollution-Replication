Jitendra, who has been in custody since November 2017 in connection with a wildlife protection case, has been granted bail by the court. The applicant was arrested along with other co-accused, and four tiger nails and a two-headed snake were recovered from their possession. The court allowed the bail application on the grounds of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail and the fact that the applicant had been in custody for over a year. The applicant has been directed to furnish a personal bond and comply with the conditions under Section 437(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The case against Jitendra and his co-accused pertains to the illegal trade of wildlife products. The recovery of four tiger nails and a two-headed snake from their possession led to their arrest. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, prohibits the trade of wildlife products and imposes strict penalties on those found guilty of violating the law. The accused were charged under various sections of the Act and the Indian Penal Code.

Jitendra had been in custody for over a year, and his bail application was pending before the court. The court granted him bail on the grounds of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail. The court also took into consideration the fact that Jitendra had been in custody for a long time and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or that he would tamper with the evidence.

The court directed Jitendra to furnish a personal bond and comply with the conditions under Section 437(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 437(3) lays down the conditions that a person must comply with while on bail. These conditions include appearing before the court on the specified dates, not leaving the country without the court's permission, and not tampering with the evidence or influencing witnesses.

The grant of bail to Jitendra has been welcomed by his family and friends. They have expressed their gratitude to the court for granting him bail and have stated that they will ensure that he complies with all the conditions laid down by the court. They have also stated that they will continue to fight for his innocence and will prove that he has been falsely implicated in the case.

The case against Jitendra and his co-accused is still pending before the court, and the trial is expected to commence soon. The prosecution will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused will have the opportunity to defend themselves. The grant of bail to Jitendra does not mean that he has been acquitted of the charges against him. It simply means that he has been released from custody pending the trial.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Jitendra, who has been in custody since November 2017 in connection with a wildlife protection case.
