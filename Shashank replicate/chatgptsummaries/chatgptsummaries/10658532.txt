The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had filed a complaint against Thomas Varghese, the CEO of Aditya Birla Retail Limited, for using banned plastic bags in their store in Delhi. Varghese challenged the order of the lower court that had taken cognizance of the complaint and summoned him. The court heard arguments from both sides and ruled that no inquiry was required under Section 202(1) of the Cr.P.C. since the case was based on documentary and oral evidence. The court also held that Varghese, as the CEO of the company, could be prosecuted under Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act. The court dismissed Varghese's petition.

The court order states that there is no need for an inquiry before summoning the revisionist based on the documentary and oral evidence presented. The complainant has provided a notification from the department of Home banning the use and storage of plastic bags, and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has the power to discharge functions of the Central Government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The CEO of the company cannot absolve himself from any wrong act done in the store on his behalf, and therefore, the revision petition is dismissed.

The court's decision is based on the fact that the use of plastic bags is banned in Delhi, and the CEO of the company cannot absolve himself from any wrong act done in the store on his behalf. The court has also held that Varghese, as the CEO of the company, could be prosecuted under Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act.
