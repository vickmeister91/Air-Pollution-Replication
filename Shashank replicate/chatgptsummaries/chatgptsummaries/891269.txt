The court order in question pertains to a case where a fine of Rs. 50 was imposed on the petitioner for not complying with a summons regarding a Touzi in which she owns an eight-annas share. The Assistant Settlement Officer imposed the fine under Order XVI, Rule 12, Civil Procedure Code. However, the petitioner objected to the order on the grounds that the procedure laid down in Rules 10, 11, and 12 of Order XVI, Civil Procedure Code, had not been followed.

The court, after hearing the petitioner's objections, upheld them and set aside the Assistant Settlement Officer's order. The court stated that the procedure laid down in Rules 10, 11, and 12 of Order XVI, Civil Procedure Code, had not been followed, and therefore, the order was invalid. The court further stated that the Court can only proceed after attachment of the property, which had not been done in this case.
