The Delhi High Court recently passed an order in a writ petition filed by the proprietor and M/s. Hotel Imperial against the respondent authorities for allotting taxi booths, shops including Tibetan shops in front of the hotel and abutting on the wall. The petitioners sought the relief of demolition and removal of such structures and for a restraint order against the respondent authorities from permitting the use of the road in front of the hotel for any such purpose.

The court ordered that the licensees must adhere to the terms and conditions of the licenses and directed the respondent NDMC to carry out an inspection of these stalls within a maximum period of four weeks from the date of the order to verify that such stallholders are adhering to the norms. The court also directed the respondent NDMC to consider the feasibility of relocating the stallholders at any other appropriate place and gave the petitioners liberty to make any additional representation in this regard within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The writ petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which empowers the High Court to issue writs, orders or directions to any person or authority, including the government, for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or for any other purpose.

The court observed that the petitioners had a legitimate grievance that the taxi booths, shops including Tibetan shops in front of the hotel and abutting on the wall were causing inconvenience to the hotel guests and were also a safety hazard. The court noted that the respondents had not denied the fact that the structures were unauthorized and had been erected without any permission from the authorities.

The court further observed that the respondents had failed to discharge their statutory duties and obligations in ensuring that the structures were not causing any inconvenience or safety hazard to the public. The court held that the respondents were duty-bound to ensure that the structures were removed and the road in front of the hotel was not used for any such purpose.
