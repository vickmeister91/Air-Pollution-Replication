The court order in question pertains to a revision petition against the rejection of an application for a search warrant under Section 93 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.). The petitioner had filed a criminal complaint against the non-applicants for offences punishable under Sections 405 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in relation to certain ornaments. The learned Magistrate had ordered the issue of a search warrant under Section 93(1)(a) of the Code, which was challenged in revision.

The revision court held that recourse must first be had to the provision of Section 91 of the Code and if the recourse to this provision is not fruitful, the learned Magistrate is free to exercise his jurisdiction under Section 93 of the Code. Section 91 of the Cr. P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or a written order to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

Recourse to the provision of Section 91 of the Code proved abortive, and the learned Magistrate held that search warrant under Section 93 of the Code cannot be issued as it would be violative of the guarantee as envisaged in Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, of immunity from self-discrimination. Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India provides that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.

The petitioner contended that Section 93 of the Code contemplates three different situations for the issue of a search warrant, and in the instant case, the issue of a search warrant with recourse to Section 93(1)(b) or (c) of the Code cannot be said to be violative of the aforesaid guarantee. Section 93(1)(b) of the Cr. P.C. empowers a court to issue a search warrant for the search of any place in which any stolen property or any property obtained by means of any offence is suspected to be concealed. Section 93(1)(c) of the Cr. P.C. empowers a court to issue a search warrant for the search of any place occupied by a person who is accused of an offence but is not attending the court or is absconding or concealing himself.

The court held that search of the premises occupied by the accused without the accused being compelled to be party to such search as provided under Section 93(1)(c) of the Code would not be violative of the constitutional guarantee enshrined in Article 20(3) of the Constitution. The view taken by the learned Magistrate in passing the impugned order is thus clearly wrong.

In summary, the court order pertains to a revision petition against the rejection of an application for a search warrant under Section 93 of the Cr. P.C. The revision court held that recourse must first be had to the provision of Section 91 of the Code and if the recourse to this provision is not fruitful, the learned Magistrate is free to exercise his jurisdiction under Section 93 of the Code. The court held that search of the premises occupied by the accused without the accused being compelled to be party to such search as provided under Section 93(1)(c) of the Code would not be violative of the constitutional guarantee enshrined in Article 20(3) of the Constitution.
