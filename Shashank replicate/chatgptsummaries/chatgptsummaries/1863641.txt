The Delhi High Court recently heard a public interest litigation regarding the unhygienic and inhumane conditions at the Idgah slaughterhouse in Delhi. The court appointed three commissioners to visit the slaughterhouse and submit a report. After examining the report and hearing counsel, the court gave various directions, including the supply of pure drinking water, prohibiting children under 18 from working in the slaughterhouse, and appointing adequate veterinary doctors. The court also directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to frame comprehensive bye-laws and rules for the smooth functioning of the slaughterhouse.

The Supreme Court later constituted a committee of experts to consider increasing the number of animals slaughtered at the slaughterhouse while keeping in mind environmental aspects, including pollution control and hygiene. The court heard arguments from various parties, including those advocating for an increase in the number of animals slaughtered and those advocating for the closure of the slaughterhouse.

The court-appointed committee suggested that the number of animals slaughtered cannot be increased unless changes are made to the transportation and location of the slaughterhouse. The committee also reported on the poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, traffic congestion, and environmental pollution in the area. The court has considered the committee's report and has concluded that increasing the number of animals slaughtered would be hazardous to the environment and the residents of the area.

The court emphasized the importance of adhering to Bureau of Indian Standards for slaughterhouses, including the provision of lairage for animals. The court also noted that the slaughterhouse is located in a densely populated area and has outlived its usefulness. The court ordered the slaughterhouse to be shut down and for the government to work on rehabilitating those who have lost their jobs as a result.

The court also ordered the provision of a slaughterhouse for export or permission for individuals to run one, with the requirement to amend bye-laws. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) argued that the number of animals permitted to be slaughtered should not be increased to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation. The MCD is implementing measures to improve the quality of meat, including sending meat samples for testing and setting up squads to check illegal slaughtering. The court received reports from experts with differing opinions on the number of animals that can be slaughtered and the need for lairage facilities. The MCD has taken measures to curb illegal slaughtering and is considering plans to modernize or set up an alternative slaughterhouse. The court is concerned about the pollution and health hazards caused by the slaughterhouse and the need for proper facilities for ante mortem and post mortem examination of animals.

The court suggested that a new, modernized slaughterhouse be built on the outskirts of Delhi, away from human habitation. The court also gave specific directions for improving the current abattoir's facilities, including lairaging animals, implementing pollution control measures, and improving water supply and waste disposal. The court emphasized the importance of cleanliness, hygiene, and pollution control in providing quality meat to the population. The court also noted that there is disagreement among committee members about the feasibility of increasing the number of animals slaughtered at the current abattoir.

The court ordered the suspension of slaughtering operations at the abattoir and the establishment of a modern mechanized slaughterhouse with proper sanitation, hygienic conditions, and pollution control. The court also directed the closure of the Idgah slaughterhouse and the rehabilitation of those rendered jobless. The respondents are ordered to ensure compliance with regulations regarding lairage and the employment of children below 18 years. The court expressed appreciation for the assistance of learned counsel in the case.

In summary, the court orders focused on the unsatisfactory conditions of the Idgah slaughterhouse in Delhi, including the lack of an effluent treatment plant, inadequate lairage space, and pollution concerns. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to Bureau of Indian Standards for slaughterhouses, including the provision of lairage for animals. The court ordered the slaughterhouse to be shut down and for the government to work on rehabilitating those who have lost their jobs as a result. The court also suggested the establishment of a new, modernized slaughterhouse with proper sanitation, hygienic conditions, and pollution control. The court emphasized the importance of cleanliness, hygiene, and pollution control in providing quality meat to the population. The court also noted that there is disagreement among committee members about the feasibility of increasing the number of animals slaughtered at the current abattoir.
