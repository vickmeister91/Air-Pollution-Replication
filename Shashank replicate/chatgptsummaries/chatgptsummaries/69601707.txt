The Kerala High Court recently heard an appeal by Indian Rare Earths Limited against the dismissal of their writ petition. The company is engaged in beach sand mining, mineral separation, and processing, and has been functioning for five decades. The court heard arguments about the disposal of radioactive waste generated by the company, which is regulated by the Atomic Energy Act. The Hazardous Waste Rules do not govern the disposal of such waste, and the company has authorization from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. The court also considered the role of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Hazardous Wastes in assessing pollution in the Eloor and Udyogamandal areas.

The Monitoring Committee found that the Periyar River in Kerala was severely polluted due to the activities of industries, including government-owned companies. The committee issued directions to remedy the situation, including implementing a scheme to supply potable water to residents in the industrial area. The cost for laying the pipelines was to be shared by the industries in the area, including the appellant. The appellant objected to paying recurring charges for the supply of drinking water, but the court found that the liability was justified due to the pollution caused by the industries. The appellant challenged the order, arguing that the 2nd respondent had no statutory power to issue it and that there was no finding of any violation of orders or statutory provisions.

The court order discusses a case involving an industrial unit that was initially charged for infrastructural costs as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility, but was later also charged for recurring costs for supplying drinking water to affected communities. The appellant argues that they should not be compelled to continue paying indefinitely, while the respondents argue that the pollution caused by the industries in the area has led to the need for clean drinking water and rehabilitation of affected residents. The court notes that a Monitoring Committee was set up by the Supreme Court to oversee the implementation of rehabilitation programs and restoration of the Periyar River, which has been contaminated by hazardous wastes from the industries. The Committee has directed the companies, including the appellant, to provide piped water to affected communities. The court finds that there are no grounds to interfere with the judgment appealed against.

The court order discusses the constitution of a Monitoring Committee by the Supreme Court to ensure proper implementation of regulations for handling and disposing of hazardous waste by industrial units. The Committee was also directed to submit quarterly reports to the Apex Court and no authority was allowed to challenge their actions. The court rejected the argument that the Committee exceeded its authority in directing the Pollution Control Board to provide drinking water to affected people. The court also held that lack of scientific data should not prevent authorities from taking action to remedy environmental damage caused by industries. The court found that the appellant was liable for contributing to pollution in the area and for the recurring costs of providing drinking water to affected areas.

The court order states that certain industrial units located near affected wards are liable for the cost of supplying drinking water to those wards. The appellant and three other industrial units have been made liable for recurring charges in respect of some wards alone. The court rejects the appellant's contention that they have been singled out and that they do not discharge any effluents into the Kuzhikandam Thodu. The court also finds that there is no justification for limiting the payments to a specific period, as the water sources in the area have been contaminated and the community has been deprived of natural water resources. The court dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the learned Single Judge.

In summary, the court orders discussed the disposal of radioactive waste generated by Indian Rare Earths Limited, the pollution caused by industries in the Eloor and Udyogamandal areas, and the role of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Hazardous Wastes in assessing pollution and directing the companies to provide piped water to affected communities. The court also held that lack of scientific data should not prevent authorities from taking action to remedy environmental damage caused by industries and that certain industrial units located near affected wards are liable for the cost of supplying drinking water to those wards. The court dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgments of the learned Single Judge.
