The first court order pertains to a petition filed by a petitioner under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, challenging the order of the Collector for the District of Banaskantha at Palanpur. The Collector had withdrawn the notice and refused to levy more stamp duty on two sale deeds executed and registered. The petitioner claimed that the sale deeds were not sufficiently stamped and the value for payment of stamp duty was assessed far below the prevalent market value to evade stamp duty. The petitioner argued that a third party has a locus standi to complain against undervaluation made for the purpose of evading stamp duty and that the person complaining has a right to have the opportunity to submit his say.

However, the court held that the Collector is not bound to afford an opportunity to the complainant, a third party, for necessary submission in the matter. The court also noted that striking down the impugned order would result in the restoration of another order passed earlier in violation of principles of natural justice. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition.

The second court order strikes down an earlier order that was passed without hearing concerned parties and violated principles of natural justice. The petitioner does not have the right to appear, plead, or act in the examination or inquiry of the correctness of the consideration or market value stated. The petitioner also does not have the legal right to enforce and file an application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court cannot entertain the application under the guise of Public Interest Litigation as it may take upon administrative and executive functions instead of dispensation of justice. The petition is dismissed.

In summary, both court orders deal with petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The first order pertains to a dispute over the assessment of stamp duty on sale deeds, while the second order deals with the examination of the correctness of the consideration or market value stated in a transaction. In both cases, the court dismissed the petitions, citing various legal and procedural grounds.
