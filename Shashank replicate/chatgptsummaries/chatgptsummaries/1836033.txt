The court order in question pertains to a case where the defendant had filed an application for the restoration of a suit that was dismissed due to an ex parte decree. The defendant claimed that the summons was not duly served on him. The court noted that there are three modes prescribed by the Code for serving a summons and that all available steps to effect personal service must be made before resort can be had to the provisions of Order 5, Rule 17, Civil P.C.

The court found that the service of the summons was not duly made on the defendant-applicant, but the failure to effect service by affixing a copy of the summons to the door of the defendant's residence was a mere irregularity in the service of summons. The court dismissed the defendant's application for restoration of the suit as the defendant had full knowledge of the date fixed for the hearing of the suit and was not prejudiced in any way nor prevented from defending the plaintiff's claim.
