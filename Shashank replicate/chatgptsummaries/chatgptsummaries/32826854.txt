The Supreme Court of India recently heard a civil appeal filed by Dileep B. Nevatia against the Union of India and others. The court condoned the delay in filing the appeal and issued a notice to the parties involved. The court also decided to tag this matter along with another case titled "M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors" as the National Green Tribunal refrained from giving any directions in this matter due to the fact that the same subject matter is being dealt with in the other case.

The case filed by Dileep B. Nevatia pertains to the issue of environmental pollution caused by industries in the state of Gujarat. The petitioner has alleged that the industries in the state are violating environmental norms and causing harm to the environment and the health of the people living in the vicinity. The petitioner has sought directions from the court to the concerned authorities to take action against the erring industries and to ensure that they comply with the environmental norms.

The court, while condoning the delay in filing the appeal, observed that the matter pertains to a serious issue of environmental pollution and needs to be dealt with urgently. The court also noted that the National Green Tribunal had refrained from giving any directions in this matter as the same subject matter was being dealt with in another case. The court, therefore, decided to tag this matter along with the other case titled "M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors" and directed the parties to file their responses.

The case of "M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors" pertains to the issue of air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. The petitioner, M.C. Mehta, had filed a case in 1985 seeking directions from the court to take measures to control air pollution in the NCR. The court had passed several orders in this matter over the years, directing the concerned authorities to take various measures to control air pollution in the NCR.

The court had also constituted a committee, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), to monitor the implementation of its orders and to take further measures to control air pollution in the NCR. The EPCA has been functioning since then and has been instrumental in taking several measures to control air pollution in the NCR.

The court, in the present case, has decided to tag the matter filed by Dileep B. Nevatia along with the case of "M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors" as both cases pertain to the issue of environmental pollution. The court has directed the parties to file their responses and has listed the matter for further hearing.

The issue of environmental pollution has been a matter of concern in India for several years now. The country has been grappling with the problem of air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution, among others. The government has taken several measures to control environmental pollution, but the problem persists.

The courts in India have been proactive in dealing with the issue of environmental pollution and have passed several orders over the years directing the concerned authorities to take measures to control environmental pollution. The courts have also constituted committees to monitor the implementation of their orders and to take further measures to control environmental pollution.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has recently heard a civil appeal filed by Dileep B. Nevatia against the Union of India and others pertaining to the issue of environmental pollution caused by industries in the state of Gujarat. The court has condoned the delay in filing the appeal and has issued a notice to the parties involved. The court has also decided to tag this matter along with another case titled "M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors" as both cases pertain to the issue of environmental pollution. The court has directed the parties to file their responses and has listed the matter for further hearing. The issue of environmental pollution has been a matter of concern in India for several years now, and the courts have been proactive in dealing with the issue and passing orders to control environmental pollution.
