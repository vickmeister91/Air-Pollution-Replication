The court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Mahaveer Trading Company against the issuance of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the District Magistrate for setting up a retail outlet by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The petitioner argued that the NOC was issued in violation of guidelines that stipulated a minimum distance of 5 km between two fuel stations on each side of the road. However, the court found that the guidelines only applied to proposals for diversion of forest land and did not apply to the present case, as the land involved was not a forest land. Therefore, the writ petition was dismissed.

The case revolved around the issuance of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the District Magistrate for setting up a retail outlet by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The petitioner, Mahaveer Trading Company, had filed a writ petition against the issuance of the NOC, arguing that it was issued in violation of guidelines that stipulated a minimum distance of 5 km between two fuel stations on each side of the road. The petitioner contended that the proposed retail outlet was within 5 km of an existing fuel station, and therefore, the NOC should not have been issued.

The court examined the guidelines and found that they only applied to proposals for diversion of forest land and did not apply to the present case, as the land involved was not a forest land. The court noted that the guidelines were intended to prevent the proliferation of fuel stations in forest areas, which could have adverse environmental impacts. However, the court found that the guidelines did not apply to non-forest areas, and therefore, the NOC was issued in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support its claim that the proposed retail outlet was within 5 km of an existing fuel station. The court observed that the petitioner had relied on a Google map to make this claim, but the map did not provide any information about the location of the existing fuel station. Therefore, the court found that the petitioner had failed to establish that the NOC was issued in violation of the guidelines.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by Mahaveer Trading Company against the issuance of the NOC by the District Magistrate for setting up a retail outlet by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The court found that the guidelines that stipulated a minimum distance of 5 km between two fuel stations on each side of the road only applied to proposals for diversion of forest land and did not apply to the present case, as the land involved was not a forest land. The court also found that the petitioner had failed to establish that the proposed retail outlet was within 5 km of an existing fuel station. Therefore, the court held that the NOC was issued in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.
