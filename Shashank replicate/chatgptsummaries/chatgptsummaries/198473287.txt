The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Akash R Hanji against an order issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board directing the closure of their unit under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court stated that the statutory remedy of an appeal under Section 31 of the Act is available to challenge the order and declined to entertain the petition. However, the statutory remedy was kept open.

The case involved a dispute between M/S Akash R Hanji and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board over the closure of the former's unit under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Board had issued the closure order on the grounds that the unit was causing air pollution and was not complying with the pollution control norms.

M/S Akash R Hanji challenged the closure order by filing a writ petition in the Karnataka High Court. The company argued that the closure order was arbitrary and illegal and that the Board had not followed the due process of law while issuing the order.

The Karnataka High Court, however, dismissed the writ petition and held that the statutory remedy of an appeal under Section 31 of the Act was available to challenge the order. The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted the statutory remedy and had directly approached the court, which was not permissible under law.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order on merits and had only raised procedural issues. The court held that the petitioner could raise all the grounds of challenge in the appeal before the appellate authority under Section 31 of the Act.

The court further observed that the statutory remedy of an appeal was a complete and effective remedy and that the petitioner could not bypass it and approach the court directly. The court held that the writ jurisdiction of the court was discretionary and that it could not be invoked if an alternative remedy was available.

However, the court kept the statutory remedy of an appeal open to the petitioner and directed the appellate authority to dispose of the appeal expeditiously. The court also directed the Board to cooperate with the appellate authority and provide all the necessary documents and information to enable the appellate authority to decide the appeal on merits.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by M/S Akash R Hanji against the closure order issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The court held that the statutory remedy of an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 was available to challenge the order and declined to entertain the petition. However, the court kept the statutory remedy of an appeal open to the petitioner and directed the appellate authority to dispose of the appeal expeditiously.
