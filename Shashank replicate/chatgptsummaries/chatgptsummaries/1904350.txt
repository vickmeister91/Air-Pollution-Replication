The Supreme Court of India issued an order in the case of M.C. Mehta vs Union of India and Ors. regarding the Taj Trapezium Matter. The court had appointed a Monitoring Committee to report on the action being taken by the Agra Mission Management Board and other authorities to remove industries polluting the atmosphere in the vicinity of Taj Mahal. The Monitoring Committee submitted a report requesting that the State of U.P. be directed to immediately stop the diversion of the river Yamuna and any further action on the bed of the river in proximity of the International Heritage Monuments until the Union Ministry clears such projects upon an environment impact assessment report.

The court directed the Central Water Power research Station Khadakwasla to assess the behavior of the river and impact of reclamation on river bed on the monuments in Agra and its protection thereof. The court also directed a CBI inquiry into the matter as it was found that the construction work commenced without clearance and this Court was not informed about it at the relevant time. The CBI inquiry found several irregularities in the project, including the absence of necessary approvals and clearances, tampering of records and interpolations, and unauthorised release of funds.

The court order directs the Central Government and State Government to conduct departmental inquiries against several officials involved in the Taj Heritage Corridor Project, including former Secretary of Environment K.C. Mishra, former Principal Environment Secretary R.K. Sharma, former Minister for Environment Naseemuddin Siddiqui, and Chief Minister Ms. Mayawati. The CBI is directed to lodge FIR and make further investigation against the involved officers and persons, and the Income Tax department is directed to cooperate in the investigation. The CBI is also directed to submit a self-contained note to the concerned authorities and ministries. The State and Central Governments are directed to complete the departmental inquiries within four months.
