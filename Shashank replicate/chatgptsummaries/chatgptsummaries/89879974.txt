The Supreme Court recently allowed the appeal of Iqbal Tanners against an order of the National Green Tribunal. The Tribunal had set aside the consent granted to the appellant under the Water Act and had remanded the matter. The Supreme Court set aside the Tribunal's order and relegated the parties to the Pollution Control Board, stating that the order dated 03.01.2017 will have to be followed. The tannery will have to remain closed until ownership is settled by the Civil Court.

The case revolves around the ownership of a tannery in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The tannery was previously owned by a partnership firm, Iqbal Tanners, which was dissolved in 2009. The partners of the firm then formed separate entities and continued to operate the tannery. However, there was a dispute over the ownership of the tannery, which led to litigation.

In 2014, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) granted consent to operate the tannery to Iqbal Tanners. However, the consent was challenged by one of the partners of the dissolved firm, who claimed that he was the rightful owner of the tannery. The matter was then taken up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

In 2016, the NGT set aside the consent granted to Iqbal Tanners by the UPPCB and remanded the matter back to the Board for fresh consideration. The NGT held that the UPPCB had not considered the objections raised by the partner who claimed ownership of the tannery. The NGT also directed that the tannery be closed until the matter was resolved.

Iqbal Tanners then appealed to the Supreme Court against the NGT's order. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the NGT's order. The Court held that the NGT had erred in setting aside the consent granted to Iqbal Tanners without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The Court also held that the NGT had exceeded its jurisdiction by directing the closure of the tannery.

The Supreme Court then relegated the parties to the UPPCB and directed that the order dated 03.01.2017, which had granted consent to Iqbal Tanners, be followed. The Court also directed that the tannery be closed until the ownership of the tannery was settled by the Civil Court.

The Supreme Court's decision has been welcomed by Iqbal Tanners, who can now resume operations at the tannery. However, the dispute over the ownership of the tannery is far from over and will continue to be litigated in the Civil Court.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in the Iqbal Tanners case highlights the importance of due process and the need for parties to be heard before any adverse orders are passed against them. The Court's decision also underscores the limits of the NGT's jurisdiction and the need for it to act within the confines of the law. The case serves as a reminder that disputes over environmental clearances and consents can have far-reaching consequences and can lead to protracted litigation.
