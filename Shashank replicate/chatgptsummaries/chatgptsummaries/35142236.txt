The court has granted bail to Veeru Ram, who was arrested in connection with a case under Sections 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act and 3/25 of the Arms Act. This was the third bail application filed by Veeru Ram, and the court allowed it after considering the statement of Devilal, who did not support the prosecution case.

The case against Veeru Ram was related to the possession of arms and ammunition, as well as the alleged killing of a wild animal. The prosecution had argued that Veeru Ram was involved in the illegal hunting of a wild animal and had used the arms and ammunition recovered from him for this purpose. However, Devilal's statement contradicted this version of events.

The court took into account Devilal's statement and found that it did not support the prosecution case. As a result, the court ordered that Veeru Ram be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each.

This decision by the court is significant as it highlights the importance of evidence in criminal cases. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented before it, and it shows that the prosecution must have strong evidence to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Furthermore, the court's decision also highlights the importance of bail in the criminal justice system. Bail is a legal right that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. It is an important safeguard against arbitrary detention and ensures that an accused person is not punished before being found guilty.

In this case, the court found that Veeru Ram was entitled to bail as there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or that he would interfere with the investigation. The court also found that the conditions imposed on Veeru Ram, such as the requirement to furnish a personal bond and surety bonds, were sufficient to ensure that he would appear in court when required.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Veeru Ram highlights the importance of evidence and bail in the criminal justice system. It also shows that the court will carefully consider all the facts and circumstances of a case before making a decision.
