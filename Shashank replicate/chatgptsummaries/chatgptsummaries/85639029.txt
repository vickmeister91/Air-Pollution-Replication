The Patna High Court recently heard two cases filed by M/S Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd. and B.K. Sureka against the State of Bihar and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Board had filed complaints against the petitioners for discharging waste water and trade effluents into the river Ghoghari without treatment. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order states that the accused, M/s Bharat Sugar Mills, was established in 1931 and had consent from the State Government until 1986 for discharge of trade effluents. However, from 1987 to March 1990, the Sugar Mill did not have valid consent for discharge of effluents. The court ruled that no person who was not associated with the company at the relevant time can be criminally proceeded against. The prosecution against petitioner no.2 was quashed.

The court also ruled that no sentence of imprisonment can be legally passed against the company as the then Executive President representing the company had died. However, the vicarious liability of the company, so far as payment of fine is concerned, would subsist. The court quashed the proceedings after 22 years as it would be violative of the principle of speedy trial.
