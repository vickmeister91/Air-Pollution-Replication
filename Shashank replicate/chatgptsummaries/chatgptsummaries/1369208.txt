In a recent court order, the issue at hand was whether questioned documents should be sealed in a confidential envelope and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination or if they should be shown to the Handwriting Expert in court. The prosecution had requested that the documents be sealed and sent to the laboratory, but the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate had declined this request, stating that the documents should be shown to the Handwriting Expert in court. However, the Forensic Science Laboratory had then requested that the documents be sent to them for examination.

The court has now ordered that the documents be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination. The court stated that the course of justice is to find the truth and that technicalities should not foreclose anyone's rights. This decision is significant because it highlights the importance of finding the truth in legal proceedings and ensuring that all parties have access to the necessary resources to do so.

The authenticity of these documents may be called into question, and it is often necessary to have them examined by experts to determine their validity.

In this case, the prosecution had requested that the documents be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination. This is a common practice in legal proceedings, as forensic experts are often called upon to examine documents and provide expert testimony in court. However, the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate had declined this request, stating that the documents should be shown to the Handwriting Expert in court.

The Handwriting Expert is another type of expert commonly used in legal proceedings. These experts are trained to analyze handwriting and other written materials to determine their authenticity. However, in this case, the Forensic Science Laboratory had requested that the documents be sent to them for examination, indicating that they believed that their expertise was necessary to determine the authenticity of the documents.

The court's decision to send the documents to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination is significant because it highlights the importance of finding the truth in legal proceedings. The court stated that the course of justice is to find the truth and that technicalities should not foreclose anyone's rights. This decision ensures that all parties have access to the necessary resources to determine the authenticity of the documents in question.
