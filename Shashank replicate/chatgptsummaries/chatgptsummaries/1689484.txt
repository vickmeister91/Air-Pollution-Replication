The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Baldev Singh against the Punjab Pollution Control Board. Singh alleged that a brick kiln established by respondent No. 3 violates the siting guidelines for such kilns and that emissions from the kilns are beyond the permissible limits under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court found that the unit was a pre-existing unit as on the date the guidelines were issued and therefore not subject to the siting guidelines.

The court directed the Punjab Pollution Control Board to take samples and report whether the stack emissions were within the permissible limits for a brick kiln established within the prohibited distance under the siting guidelines. The report showed that the brick kiln was not violating the stack emission standards stipulated for such kilns. As a result, the petition was dismissed without any order as to costs.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and guidelines. The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and it empowers state pollution control boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution.

In this case, the petitioner alleged that the brick kiln violated the siting guidelines for such kilns and that emissions from the kilns were beyond the permissible limits under the act. The court found that the unit was a pre-existing unit as on the date the guidelines were issued and therefore not subject to the siting guidelines. However, the court directed the Punjab Pollution Control Board to take samples and report whether the stack emissions were within the permissible limits for a brick kiln established within the prohibited distance under the siting guidelines.

The report showed that the brick kiln was not violating the stack emission standards stipulated for such kilns. This is a positive development as it indicates that the brick kiln is operating within the permissible limits and is not causing excessive air pollution. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that the brick kiln is completely free from environmental concerns. It is still important for the kiln to adhere to all relevant environmental regulations and guidelines to ensure that it operates in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and guidelines. It also emphasizes the need for state pollution control boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. While the brick kiln in question was found to be operating within the permissible limits, it is important for all industries to take steps to minimize their environmental impact and operate in a sustainable manner.
