Dr. Pratibha, a new mother who was on bed rest after giving birth, was issued a notice to appear before the Investigating Officer regarding an accident allegedly caused by her vehicle. The Public Prosecutor suggested that the Investigating Officer could record her statement at her home if she hands over the vehicle. The petitioner's counsel agreed to this and the court ordered accordingly.

The case of Dr. Pratibha highlights the importance of balancing the rights of the accused with their physical and mental well-being. In this case, the court recognized the unique circumstances of Dr. Pratibha's situation and ordered that her statement be recorded at her home, rather than requiring her to appear in person.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Dr. Pratibha was on bed rest after giving birth, which would make it difficult for her to travel to the Investigating Officer's office. Additionally, the court recognized that the stress of appearing in person could have a negative impact on her physical and mental health, which could ultimately harm her ability to defend herself in court.

The Public Prosecutor's suggestion that the Investigating Officer could record Dr. Pratibha's statement at her home was a reasonable compromise that allowed for the investigation to proceed while also taking into account her unique circumstances. By agreeing to this suggestion, the petitioner's counsel demonstrated a willingness to work with the court to find a solution that was fair to all parties involved.

Overall, the court's decision in this case demonstrates the importance of considering the individual circumstances of each case when making decisions about how to proceed with an investigation or trial. By taking into account Dr. Pratibha's physical and mental well-being, the court was able to ensure that she was able to participate in the investigation without compromising her health or her ability to defend herself in court. This approach is essential to ensuring that the justice system is fair and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their circumstances.
