The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Satish Kumar regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders, including directing the State Pollution Control Board to inspect the canals and report on the pollution being caused and the remedial measures. The State was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The NGT also directed the State to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and file a status report on the quality of drinking water.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state has planned to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal to prevent contamination. The court also imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court requests the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records of a related case. The state is directed to submit a comprehensive short term and long term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the state fails to submit the scheme. The district collector is directed to be present on the next hearing date. The court orders the state to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The state is directed to furnish copies of all compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments on canals providing drinking water in the city of Sriganganagar. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those contributing to pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The compliance report filed by the state did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the state to comply with the directions in letter and spirit and remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The state was directed to file a compliance report, and the matter was adjourned to a later date.

The court order gives the Counsel for the State another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal to provide information and records relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order discusses a petitioner seeking a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching a writ court with an allegation that the tribunal under the orders impugned exceeded jurisdiction vested with it. The court concludes that the tribunal did not lack jurisdiction and that the petitioner should avail of the alternative remedy provided under the Act of 2010. The court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016.
