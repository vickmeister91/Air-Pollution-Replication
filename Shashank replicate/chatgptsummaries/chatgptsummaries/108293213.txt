The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Ashok Sarkar against the State of Jharkhand and Shankar Kishore Mahto. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, which had taken cognizance of an offence under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner argued that the provisions laid down in Rule 11(b) of the rules framed under the Act had not been followed, and therefore, the court was precluded from taking cognizance of the offence.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a comprehensive legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to protect and improve the environment. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution and the protection of the environment. Section 15 of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder. The punishment for such contravention can extend to imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.

Rule 11(b) of the rules framed under the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Act or the rules made thereunder except on a complaint made by an officer authorized in this behalf by the Central Government or the State Government. The petitioner argued that since the complaint in this case was not made by an authorized officer, the court was precluded from taking cognizance of the offence.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and quashed the entire criminal proceeding, including the order taking cognizance. The court held that the provisions of Rule 11(b) were mandatory and had to be followed strictly. Since the complaint in this case was not made by an authorized officer, the court was precluded from taking cognizance of the offence. The court also observed that the failure to follow the mandatory provisions of Rule 11(b) was a serious irregularity that could not be condoned.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the mandatory provisions of the law. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a crucial legislation that seeks to protect and improve the environment. The Act provides for stringent punishment for contravention of its provisions, and it is essential that the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder are followed strictly. The court's decision in this case ensures that the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder are not circumvented, and the environment is protected.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Ashok Sarkar v. State of Jharkhand and Shankar Kishore Mahto highlights the importance of following the mandatory provisions of the law. The court held that the provisions of Rule 11(b) of the rules framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, were mandatory and had to be followed strictly. Since the complaint in this case was not made by an authorized officer, the court was precluded from taking cognizance of the offence. The court's decision ensures that the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder are not circumvented, and the environment is protected.
