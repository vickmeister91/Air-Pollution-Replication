In a case where a petitioner challenged the rejection of his application for a Timber Transit Permit to remove trees from his private land in Orissa, the court has issued an order that clarifies the application of the Forest Conservation Act. The land in question had been declared a sanctuary in 1976, and the petitioner had previously been denied permission to remove trees in 2005. The appellate authority remitted the matter to the Divisional Forest Officer to examine the ownership of the land and whether it attracted the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act. The D.F.O. rejected the application, stating that the removal of trees was a non-forestry activity and required prior permission from the Government of India under the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioner appealed, but the Conservator of Forests dismissed the appeal, stating that the land was a forest and that felling trees was a non-forestry activity that required permission from the Central Government. The petitioner challenged this decision in court.

The court order clarifies that the ban on felling trees in forests, as per the Conservation Act, applies to all forests regardless of ownership or classification. However, the ban does not extend to non-forest private plantations. The court also clarifies that it cannot rewrite the statute and that the ban does not apply to leasehold land that was not converted from a forest. The court quashes the orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer and the Conservator of Forest and directs the petitioner's application for a T.T. permit to be dealt with in accordance with the observations made in the judgment. No costs are awarded.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act and the need for clarity in its application. The court's order provides guidance on the interpretation of the Act and its application to different types of land. It also emphasizes the need for proper examination of ownership and classification of land before granting permission for activities such as tree felling.

The court's decision to quash the orders passed by the Divisional Forest Officer and the Conservator of Forest and direct the petitioner's application to be dealt with in accordance with the observations made in the judgment is a significant step towards ensuring that the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act are applied correctly. It also highlights the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and protecting the environment.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case provides clarity on the application of the Forest Conservation Act and emphasizes the need for proper examination of ownership and classification of land before granting permission for activities such as tree felling. The order also highlights the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and protecting the environment.
