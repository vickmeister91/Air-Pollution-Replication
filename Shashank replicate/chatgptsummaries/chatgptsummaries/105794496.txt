The case of St. Joseph Granites involves the violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, which resulted in the seizure of five lorries, a JCB earth mover, and a hydraulic excavator. The petitioner filed an application seeking interim custody of the vehicle, which was granted by the court below. However, the order was challenged, and the court ordered the release of the vehicle on the condition that the petitioner furnishes security for the amount of valuation of the vehicle before the court below by producing a fixed deposit receipt for the said amount of valuation, on which the lean of the court below is noted by the concerned Bank.

The petitioner was unable to produce the fixed deposit receipt due to the long lapse of time, and thus, sought issuance of appropriate directions. The court directed the learned Magistrate to release the vehicles seized from the possession of the petitioner by accepting Bank Guarantee instead of fixed deposit as ordered in Ext.P2.

The court's decision to release the vehicles on the condition of furnishing security is in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act provides for the seizure of vehicles used for illegal activities related to wildlife, and the release of such vehicles is subject to the furnishing of security for the amount of valuation of the vehicle.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to furnish a Bank Guarantee instead of a fixed deposit is also reasonable, given the long lapse of time. The court's primary concern is to ensure that the security furnished is adequate to cover the valuation of the vehicle, and a Bank Guarantee is a valid form of security.

Overall, the court's decision in the case of St. Joseph Granites is a balanced one, taking into account the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act and the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner in furnishing security. The court's direction to accept a Bank Guarantee instead of a fixed deposit is a pragmatic solution that ensures the release of the vehicles while also providing adequate security.
