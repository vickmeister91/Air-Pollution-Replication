The Arulmigu Mariamman Temple in Trichy District had challenged an order from the District Forest Officer to hand over tusks held in possession of an elephant named Mariappan, who was rendering duties as Temple elephant. The tusks were considered a 'Trophy' under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and cannot be in the possession of the petitioner. The court ruled that the provisions of the Act do not support the stand of the respondents and that the Temple can maintain the tusks in a proper condition.

The ownership of Mariappan by the Temple is not in dispute, but the tusks are considered a 'Trophy' under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and cannot be in the possession of the petitioner. The court order states that if an animal is being hunted in a sanctuary or national park declared by the Central Government, the animal, any article, trophy, uncured trophy, or meat derived from the animal, or any vehicle, vessel, weapon, trap, or tool used for hunting shall be the property of the Central Government. Section 39(3) prohibits anyone from acquiring or keeping such government property without permission from the Chief Wild Life Warden or authorized officer. Section 40(2A) prohibits anyone from acquiring, receiving, keeping in their control, custody, or possession any captive animal, animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy without a certificate of ownership.

The court rejected the respondent's claim that they are the owners of an elephant's tusks and that ownership would extend to trophies. The court allowed the possession of the tusks to remain with the temple and ordered the respondents to ensure their safety. The temple comes under the aegis of the Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments department, and the Executive Officer of the Temple has overall control of its activities and assets.
