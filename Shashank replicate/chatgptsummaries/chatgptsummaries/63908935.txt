The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over the pollution and encroachment of natural streams and rivers in Meghalaya and Manipur. In the first court order, the Principal of St. Anthony's College filed a writ petition against the State of Meghalaya and others regarding the pollution of a natural stream that runs through the college and is a tributary of the Wahumkhrah River. The court considers the "Doctrine of Public Trust" and notes that the portion of the stream in question is a public stream situated within the Municipality, and therefore under the management and control of the Shillong Municipal Board. The court orders the respondents No.6 & 7 to demolish the illegal construction and restore the stream to its original condition, and directs the Municipal Board to take necessary steps to prevent the pollution of the stream.

In the second court order, St. Anthony's College and the Wahlang family were in dispute over the covering of a natural stream. The court notes that the Shillong Municipal Board is the only competent authority to regulate the stream and that any encroachment or obstruction without necessary permission or order from the Board must be removed by the Board. The court cites relevant sections of the Municipal Act, 1973 to support its ruling.

The third court order outlines various sections of the Municipal Act, including regulations on the alignment of buildings on public roads and drains, the erection of platforms, cutting of public roads, and the prohibition of building without sanction. The case in question involves a notice issued by the Shillong Municipal Board to a property owner to remove a cement slab covering a natural stream and a boundary wall erected without permission. The property owner did not comply with the notice, leading to legal action. The respondent argued that the construction was for eco-friendly purposes and that the petitioner's college was responsible for pollution in the area.

The fourth court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a retaining wall on a plot of land near a stream. The petitioner is accused of polluting the stream with garbage and sewage from their college. The court cites constitutional obligations to protect the environment and public trust doctrine, which prohibits individuals from encroaching on public resources like rivers and streams. The court also cites previous cases where polluters were held liable for restitution of the environment.

The fifth court order discusses the application of the public trust doctrine to lands dedicated to public interest. It cites a case where a group of citizens sued to prevent the construction of a commercial facility on public parkland. The court found the lease and management agreement invalid as they exceeded the statutory grant of authority and promoted private profit over public use. The court also ordered a motel to pay compensation for environmental damage caused by its construction and to take measures to restore the area to its natural state. The order emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and cites the need for a general legislation of pollution.

The sixth court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the duty of governments to do so. It mentions the Doctrine of the Public Trust, which states that certain resources like air, sea, water, and forests should not be subject to private ownership and should be freely available to everyone. The court directs the state government to protect the Nambul River by evicting encroachers and ensuring the Imphal Municipal Council discharges its duties. The court also imposes severe punishment for those who endanger the environment and orders the eviction of encroachers within four months. The order has been complied with, and in a similar case, the court imposed exemplary damages of Rs.10 lakhs to a motel for violating environmental laws.

In all of these court orders, the courts emphasize the importance of protecting the environment and public resources like rivers and streams. They cite the Doctrine of Public Trust, which prohibits individuals from encroaching on public resources and promotes the idea that certain resources should be freely available to everyone. The courts also cite relevant sections of the Municipal Act to support their rulings and emphasize the need for general legislation of pollution. The courts impose fines and imprisonment for violations of relevant laws, with fines up to one lakh of rupees. They also order polluters to pay exemplary damages for ecological restoration and to take measures to restore the environment to its natural state.
