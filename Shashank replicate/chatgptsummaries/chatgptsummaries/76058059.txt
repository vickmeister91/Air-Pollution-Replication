The court order pertains to an application filed under Section 14 read with Section 18 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The applicant has raised concerns about the implementation of noise limits for automobiles at the manufacturing stage, as specified in Schedule VI, Part E, of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The respondents include various government ministries, statutory boards, and the State of Maharashtra. The court has provided a summary of the roles and responsibilities of each respondent.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by vehicles and the need to enforce compliance with noise standards for vehicles at the manufacturing stage. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 defines noise as an air pollutant and the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Board are responsible for improving air quality and laying down standards for emission of air pollutants. The Environment (Protection) Rules specify noise limits for automobiles at the manufacturing stage, which have been amended over time. The court order also mentions the test method to be followed for measuring noise limits and the dates of implementation for different types of vehicles.

The court order specifies noise limits for vehicles at the manufacturing stage, with different limits for different types of vehicles based on their displacement and number of seats. The order also mentions that certain states have different noise limits applicable from specific dates. The applicant argues that the method of measuring external noise emitted by moving vehicles specified by the Indian Standard of Institutes (ISI) is in violation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. The applicant also claims that the Respondent No.2 has not provided any information on monitoring and implementation of such standards for noise limits for automobiles at the manufacturing stage.

The court order discusses an application filed by the applicant regarding the noise limits for automobiles at the manufacturing stage. The applicant claims that no organization is conducting tests on automobiles to ensure that the noise levels are maintained within the specified limits. The applicant requests the court to direct the respondent to give guidelines to the state boards for monitoring and enforcing the standards for automobile noise. The respondent submits that the revised noise limits for automobiles have been identified and implemented under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, and no separate guidelines are required. The court directs the respondent to submit a clarification affidavit regarding the implementing provisions.

The court ordered the Respondent No.1 to submit an affidavit clarifying the legal authorities and powers given to implementing agencies under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Respondent No.2 did not file an affidavit as there were no averments against them. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) submitted an affidavit stating that the State Pollution Control Board is the authority to prescribe standards under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the MoRTH is regulating vehicle noise at the manufacturing stage through seven agencies. The Maharashtra government's Home Department (Transport) is the authority declared for enforcement and maintenance of noise standards laid down under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is one of six testing and certifying agencies authorized by the Central Government under Rule 126 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by automobiles and the need to enforce noise-related standards for vehicles. The Industry Standard Committee (AISC) is responsible for preparing and reviewing these standards, while the Transport Commissioner is responsible for ensuring compliance with them. The court considers whether there is a mechanism for enforcing these standards and whether there is a need to amend them to comply with environmental laws. The court emphasizes the importance of controlling noise pollution for public health and notes that noise pollution can have physical, physiological, psychological, and work performance effects.

The court order discusses the implementation of noise limits for vehicles at the manufacturing stage, as stipulated by the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The standards have two phases of implementation for vehicles manufactured from 2003 and 1st April 2005. The court directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) to clarify the provisions under which implementing agencies are given powers and legal authority under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to be exercised by the Respondent No.2 for implementation of relevant rules. The MoEF responded that the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, incorporate the noise standards, and any violation is punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The court also mentions the Motor Vehicle Rule 120, which prescribes the noise standards for automobiles at the manufacturing stage.

The court order discusses the implementation and enforcement of noise standards for automobiles at the manufacturing stage. The court finds that there is a lack of a well-defined mechanism to enforce these standards, resulting in unabated noise pollution. The court also notes that the prescribed noise standards are not being implemented by concerned agencies. The court recommends strict adherence to IS: 3028-1998 standards for testing noise limits from automobiles. The court also appreciates the technical procedures and methodologies for measuring noise from automobiles outlined in BIS standards IS: 3028-1998.

The court order discusses the need for effective implementation of noise standards for automobiles to control noise pollution in urban areas. The court suggests including environmental regulatory authorities in the committee for
