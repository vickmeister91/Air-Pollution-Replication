The case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order dated 25.11.2016 passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate No.8, Jodhpur Metropolitan in Criminal Original Case No. 25/2014. The petitioner argued that there was a compromise entered between the parties but the investigating officer did not put the compromise in the charge sheet. The court dismissed the petition but made it clear that if the fact of the failed compromise is brought to the notice of the learned court below by the parties, the same shall be considered by the learned court below during proceedings, if it has any hearing on the merits strictly in accordance with law.

The petitioner's argument was that there was a compromise entered between the parties, but the investigating officer did not put the compromise in the charge sheet. The court dismissed the petition, but it made it clear that if the fact of the failed compromise is brought to the notice of the learned court below by the parties, the same shall be considered by the learned court below during proceedings, if it has any hearing on the merits strictly in accordance with law.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that a compromise had been reached between the parties. The court also noted that the investigating officer had not included any information about the alleged compromise in the charge sheet, which suggested that there was no evidence to support the petitioner's claim.

However, the court did acknowledge that if the parties were able to provide evidence of the failed compromise during the proceedings, the court would consider it in accordance with the law. This means that the court would not automatically dismiss the claim, but would instead consider it on its merits and in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court's decision was based on the lack of evidence provided by the petitioner to support their claim of a compromise. However, the court did leave the door open for the parties to provide additional evidence during the proceedings, which would be considered in accordance with the law.
