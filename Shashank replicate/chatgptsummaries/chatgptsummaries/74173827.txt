The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving electrocution and the liability of companies responsible for maintaining power lines. In the first case, Torrent Power Ltd. filed a First Appeal against a judgment and order passed by the City Civil and Sessions Court in Ahmedabad. The appellant argued that there was no fault on their part for the death by electrocution and that the burden of proving negligence lies with the plaintiff. The appellant's counsel cited a judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in support of their argument. 

The second court order involved a case where a person died due to electrocution from a hanging wire. The defendant company responsible for maintaining the line was held liable for negligence and failing to maintain the line properly. The court rejected the defendant's argument of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased and referred to the principle of strict liability. The court also considered the issue of compensation and deducted one-third of the deceased's income for personal expenses. The defendant's appeal was dismissed. 

In the third court order, the defendant was found negligent in a case where a person died due to electrocution from a fallen high tension electric wire. The defendant argued that the burden of proof for negligence should be on the plaintiffs, but the court disagreed, stating that the defendant had an obligation to maintain the line and prevent such incidents. The concept of strict liability was emphasized, making negligence irrelevant. The court cited a previous case where the responsibility to compensate the sufferer was that of the supplier of the electric energy. The defendant's argument that someone else may have committed mischief by siphoning energy was not accepted as a defense. 

The fourth court order discussed the concept of strict liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous activities. The court cited various judgments and observations to establish that enterprises engaged in such activities are strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those affected by any accidents resulting from their operations. The court emphasized that the law must evolve to keep pace with the changing needs of society and cannot remain static. The managers of supply systems have a duty to prevent pilferage and install necessary devices to prevent mishaps. The court also noted that the liability under the rule of strict liability is strict and absolute, and it is no defense that the thing escaped without the person's willful act, default, or neglect or that they had no knowledge of its existence. 

The fifth court order discussed the obligation of enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities to conduct them with the highest standards of safety and be absolutely liable for any harm caused. The judgment also considered the issue of contributory negligence and set aside the finding that the deceased was liable for 20% of the negligence. The court awarded compensation of Rs. 1,74,000 with interest at 8% from the date of filing of the suit till realization. The First Appeal was dismissed subject to the modification mentioned in the order. 

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of maintaining safety standards in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities and the concept of strict liability in such cases. The burden of proof for negligence lies with the defendant, and they have an obligation to maintain their equipment and prevent accidents. The court also emphasizes the need for the law to evolve to keep pace with changing societal needs and the absolute liability of enterprises engaged in hazardous activities to compensate those affected by any accidents resulting from their operations.
