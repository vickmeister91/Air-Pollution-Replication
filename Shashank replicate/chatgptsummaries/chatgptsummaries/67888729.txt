The court order in question relates to a criminal complaint case where the applicant had challenged an order passed by the JMFC Burhanpur and the Sessions Judge, Burhanpur. The applicant had requested for certain documents to be produced by the complainant, but the trial court had ruled that one of the documents could not be produced as it was not maintained by the complainant. The applicant had then approached the higher courts seeking relief.

The court, after hearing both parties, found no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by the lower courts. The court observed that the trial court had correctly ruled that the document in question could not be produced as it was not maintained by the complainant. The court also noted that the applicant had failed to provide any evidence to show that the lower courts had acted illegally or with perversity.

The court further observed that the lower courts had followed the correct procedure and had given due consideration to the evidence presented before them. The court noted that it was not its role to interfere with the findings of the lower courts unless there was a clear case of illegality or perversity.

The court, therefore, dismissed the applicant's petition and upheld the orders passed by the lower courts. The court's decision reaffirms the principle that the higher courts will not interfere with the findings of the lower courts unless there is a clear case of illegality or perversity.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal complaint case where the applicant had challenged an order passed by the lower courts. The court, after hearing both parties, found no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by the lower courts and dismissed the applicant's petition. The court's decision reaffirms the principle that the higher courts will not interfere with the findings of the lower courts unless there is a clear case of illegality or perversity.
