In a recent court order, the petitioner Shyama Chauhan sought the release of his seized vehicle, which was being used by accused persons in a criminal case related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Chief Judicial Magistrate had earlier rejected Chauhan's application for Supurdnama of the seized vehicle, leading to the filing of the present petition.

The court considered the fact that the trial was at an initial stage and that the vehicle had been lying idle in police custody for almost 14 months. The court referred to previous judgments and ordered the release of the vehicle to Chauhan subject to certain conditions.
