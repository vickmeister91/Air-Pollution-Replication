The court order pertains to a money suit filed by Bengal Silk Mills Co. against Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff. The defendant company had borrowed money from Golam Hossain Cassim Ariff during the years 1928 to 1936, and the balance due to him on November 30, 1936, was Rs. 2,77,010/10/7 pies. The plaintiff, who is the sole surviving executor to Ariff's will, filed the suit for recovery of the balance due. The defendant raised the defense of limitation, but the plaintiff relied on the acknowledgments of liability contained in the balance-sheets of the defendant company for the years ended 30-11-1930 to 30-11-1936.

The court found that the balance-sheets were duly passed by the defendant company at its annual general meetings and contained admissions of liability. The court also held that the admissions were voluntary and conscious, and not made under compulsion of law. The court further held that the admissions must be of subsisting liability to satisfy the test of an acknowledgment under Section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act.

The court order discusses the requirements for an admission of liability to be considered a subsisting liability under Section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act. The court finds that the balance sheets in question contain an admission of a subsisting liability to continue the relation of debtor and creditor, and a definite representation of a present intention to keep the liability alive until it is lawfully determined by payment or otherwise.

The court also addresses the issue of whether the managing agents of the defendant company had the authority to acknowledge the debt due to the plaintiff. The court finds that the managing agents had the authority to make the acknowledgments contained in the balance sheets, as they were acting within the scope of their authority as managing agents.

Ultimately, the court finds that the balance sheets are sufficient acknowledgments under Section 19 and the plaintiff's claim is not barred by the law of limitation. The appeal is dismissed and the appellant is ordered to pay the respondent's costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to a money suit filed by Bengal Silk Mills Co. against Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff for the recovery of a balance due on a loan made by Golam Hossain Cassim Ariff to the defendant company. The plaintiff relied on the acknowledgments of liability contained in the defendant company's balance sheets for the years ended 30-11-1930 to 30-11-1936 to overcome the defense of limitation raised by the defendant.

The court found that the acknowledgments contained in the balance sheets were voluntary and conscious, and not made under compulsion of law. The court also held that the acknowledgments must be of subsisting liability to satisfy the test of an acknowledgment under Section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act.
