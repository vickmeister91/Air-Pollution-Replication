The court order pertains to two appeals filed under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. In both cases, the appellants had filed applications under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to produce income tax particulars of their respective husbands to prove their income status and savings. However, the learned Magistrates had dismissed the applications, which the appellants appealed against.

In the first case, the court found that the reasoning given by the learned Magistrate for rejection of the application was not tenable in law and on the facts of the case. The court noted that the income status of the husband was relevant to determine the amount of maintenance to be awarded to the wife. Therefore, the court allowed the appeal and directed the Income Tax authorities to produce the documents as sought for by the appellant.

In the second case, the court found that the income tax particulars were necessary to prove the respondent's savings, which were relevant to determine the amount of maintenance to be awarded to the appellant. The court noted that the learned Magistrate had dismissed the application without considering the relevance of the documents sought for. Therefore, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the learned Magistrate, and directed the learned Magistrate to summon the documents from the Income Tax authorities. The parties were directed to assist the learned Magistrate to dispose of the petition on its merit within six months from the date of the order.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of income tax particulars in determining the amount of maintenance to be awarded to the wife under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The Act recognizes the right of women to live a life free from violence and abuse and provides for a range of reliefs, including monetary reliefs, to protect their rights. The Act also recognizes the economic dependence of women on their husbands and provides for maintenance to be awarded to the wife in case of domestic violence.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for the learned Magistrates to consider the relevance of the documents sought for by the appellants before dismissing their applications. The learned Magistrates should take into account the purpose for which the documents are sought for and the relevance of the documents to the case. The learned Magistrates should also ensure that the parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case and that the proceedings are conducted in a just and fair manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in both cases is a welcome development in the protection of women's rights under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The decision recognizes the importance of income tax particulars in determining the amount of maintenance to be awarded to the wife and emphasizes the need for the learned Magistrates to consider the relevance of the documents sought for by the appellants. The decision also underscores the need for the proceedings to be conducted in a just and fair manner, ensuring that the parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case.
