The Delhi District Court has convicted M/S N.R. Industries for violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by discharging untreated trade effluent into a drain without obtaining requisite consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The accused had pleaded not guilty, but the court found them guilty based on the testimony of witnesses and relevant provisions of the Act. The court also considered the accused's claim that they had installed an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and found it to be insufficient.

The court order pertains to a case between DPCC and M/s N.R. Industries regarding violations of water pollution laws. The order outlines restrictions on new outlets and new discharge of sewage, and provisions regarding existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent. The accused argues that they were falsely implicated and that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, the court finds that the complaint is valid and that the accused did violate water pollution laws. The accused also argues that their unit was not working at the time of inspection and that they had installed an effluent treatment plant, but the court finds that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims.

The court order states that the accused, Nathu Ram, installed an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) in his unit for electroplating but did not maintain it properly, resulting in untreated effluent being discharged directly into the public sewer/drain. The accused did not have the requisite consent from DPCC and did not obtain a notice under section 25 of the Water (Prevention & Control Pollution) Act, 1974. The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and Nathu Ram is held guilty and convicted for the offense under sections 24/25/26 of the Act, punishable under sections 43/44 of the Act. The accused will be heard on sentence on 26.03.2015.

In all three court orders, the accused parties were found guilty of violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The first case involved M/S N.R. Industries, which was found guilty of discharging untreated trade effluent into a drain without obtaining requisite consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The accused had claimed to have installed an ETP, but the court found it to be insufficient. In the second case, the accused argued that they were falsely implicated and that the complaint was not filed by a competent person. However, the court found the complaint to be valid and the accused guilty of violating water pollution laws. The third case involved Nathu Ram, who had installed an ETP but did not maintain it properly, resulting in untreated effluent being discharged directly into the public sewer/drain. Nathu Ram did not have the requisite consent from DPCC and did not obtain a notice under section 25 of the Act.

The court orders also outlined provisions and restrictions regarding the discharge of sewage or trade effluent. In the second case, the court ordered restrictions on new outlets and new discharge of sewage, as well as provisions regarding existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent. These provisions and restrictions are in place to prevent water pollution and protect the environment.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder that individuals and companies must comply with environmental laws and regulations to prevent water pollution. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences and harm to the environment. It is important for all individuals and companies to take responsibility for their actions and ensure that they are not contributing to water pollution.
