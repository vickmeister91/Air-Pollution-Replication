The case of Prakash Swami, a stone crushing industry owner, came before the court seeking a direction to the Pollution Control Board to issue consent to operate in favor of his unit. The petitioner's unit had been suspended due to complaints of noise and air pollution, but the suspension was later withdrawn. However, the Pollution Control Board had not yet made a decision on the petitioner's application for consent to operate.

The court took note of the fact that the petitioner's unit had been suspended earlier due to complaints of noise and air pollution. The court also observed that the Pollution Control Board had not yet made a decision on the petitioner's application for consent to operate. The court directed the Pollution Control Board to make a decision within four weeks and ensure that the petitioner's unit conforms to permissible air quality and noise level parameters if consent is granted.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need for strict compliance with them. The court's directive to the Pollution Control Board to make a decision within four weeks is a clear indication that delays in decision-making will not be tolerated when it comes to environmental issues.
