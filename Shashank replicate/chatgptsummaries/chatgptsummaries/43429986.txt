The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has been ordered by the court to refrain from issuing a final notification regarding the eco-sensitive zone until further orders. The court order is in response to a petition filed by a concerned citizen who alleges that the preliminary notification issued by the Ministry was based on a proposal sent by the State Government, which covered an area of 3,32,881 hectares. The petitioner further alleges that the area was later limited to 500 meters from the sanctuary and reduced to 1,14,000 hectares only.

The court has granted interim relief to the petitioner and has ordered that no final notification shall be issued until further orders. The matter has been posted for final disposal on 20.06.2019.

The petitioner's allegations raise concerns about the process followed by the Ministry in notifying the eco-sensitive zone. The petitioner has argued that the Ministry's decision was based on a proposal sent by the State Government, which covered a much larger area than what was eventually notified. The petitioner has also alleged that the area was later reduced to a much smaller size without proper justification.

The court's decision to grant interim relief to the petitioner indicates that there are valid concerns about the Ministry's decision-making process. The court has recognized the need to investigate the matter further before a final decision is made.

The issue of eco-sensitive zones is a contentious one, with stakeholders often having conflicting interests. On the one hand, eco-sensitive zones are meant to protect the environment and wildlife from the adverse effects of human activity. On the other hand, they can restrict the activities of local communities and limit their access to natural resources.

In this case, the petitioner's concerns about the size of the eco-sensitive zone and the process followed by the Ministry highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability in decision-making related to eco-sensitive zones. The court's decision to grant interim relief and investigate the matter further is a step in the right direction.

Overall, the court order in this case is significant as it highlights the need for greater scrutiny of the process followed by the Ministry in notifying eco-sensitive zones. The court's decision to grant interim relief to the petitioner and order further investigation before a final decision is made is a positive development. It remains to be seen what the final outcome of the case will be, but the court's decision is a reminder that decisions related to eco-sensitive zones must be made with care and consideration for all stakeholders involved.
