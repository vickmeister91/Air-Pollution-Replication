The Patna High Court received an application from a social worker claiming that a chemical factory was discharging untreated effluents, chemical wastes, and sewage, which was contaminating water resources and polluting the environment. The court ordered an enquiry and forbade the factory from discharging any trade effluent or sewage beyond its premises until further orders. The court also received a report from an expert committee, which found that the effluent was highly pollutant and that the factory did not have adequate pollution control measures. The court ordered the factory to suspend all manufacturing processes until further orders.

The factory challenged the order, but the court upheld it. The court found that the factory was responsible for setting up a regular effluent treatment plant. A second report by a committee constituted by the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Bihar, confirmed the findings of the expert committee. The court ordered the factory to set up the plant and suspended its manufacturing process until it complied with the order.

The company was ordered to set up lagoons with polythene sheets, fence the area, provide for centrifugal separation of fermented sludge, and construct an earthen dyke with close plantation to limit odors.
