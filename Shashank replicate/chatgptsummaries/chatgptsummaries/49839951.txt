The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Mariyam against the order passed by the Rent Controlling Authority (RCA) in Neemuch, regarding the eviction of a tenant from two shops. The respondent had filed an objection that only one shop belonged to the petitioner and the suit for eviction could only be filed for that shop. The RCA had allowed the objection and dismissed the suit for one shop. The petitioner had filed the writ petition challenging the order.

However, the respondent had raised a preliminary objection that the writ petition was not maintainable as the statutory remedy of revision was available to the petitioner. The court held that since the suit was filed under the provisions of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961, the order passed by the RCA was revisionable before the High Court and the writ petition was not maintainable. The petition was dismissed as not maintainable.
