Ltd and M/S Hotel Clarks Amer, a court order was issued in response to a petition challenging an order passed by the learned Additional Session Judge, which was affirmed by the learned Revisional Court. The petitioner had sought to challenge an interlocutory order under Section 397 (2) Cr.P.C. However, the court observed that such a revision petition was not maintainable under the aforementioned section. As a result, the court dismissed the petition, stating that there was no merit in it.

The case in question involved a dispute between Conferences & Incentives Management Pvt. Ltd and M/S Hotel Clarks Amer. It is unclear what the nature of the dispute was, but it is likely that it was related to a business transaction or contract between the two parties. At some point during the proceedings, an order was passed by the learned Additional Session Judge, which was subsequently affirmed by the learned Revisional Court.

The petitioner, Conferences & Incentives Management Pvt. Ltd, was not satisfied with the order and sought to challenge it through a revision petition. However, the court observed that such a petition was not maintainable under Section 397 (2) Cr.P.C. This section deals with the revisional powers of the High Court or Sessions Judge in relation to interlocutory orders passed by subordinate courts. It states that such orders can only be revised if they have resulted in a miscarriage of justice or if they have adversely affected the rights of the accused.

In this case, the court found that the order in question did not meet either of these criteria. As a result, the revision petition was dismissed. The court stated that there was no merit in the petition, indicating that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient grounds for challenging the order.

It is worth noting that interlocutory orders are those that are passed during the course of a trial or proceeding, and are not final in nature. They are intended to regulate the proceedings and ensure that they are conducted in a fair and just manner. Examples of interlocutory orders include orders for the production of documents, orders for the examination of witnesses, and orders for the framing of charges.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal case between Conferences & Incentives Management Pvt. Ltd and M/S Hotel Clarks Amer. The petitioner had sought to challenge an interlocutory order passed by the learned Additional Session Judge, which was affirmed by the learned Revisional Court. However, the court observed that such a revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397 (2) Cr.P.C. As a result, the petition was dismissed, with the court stating that there was no merit in it. While the nature of the dispute between the two parties is unclear, the case serves as a reminder of the limitations on the revisional powers of the High Court or Sessions Judge in relation to interlocutory orders passed by subordinate courts.
