The court order pertains to a petition filed by Changar College Sanghrsh Samiti, alleging that the government of Himachal Pradesh had violated the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and environmental laws by establishing a new government college at Takipur instead of Ranital. The petitioners argued that the government's decision to establish a college at Takipur was arbitrary and capricious, and that it violated the provisions of the Education Act, which mandates that every child between the ages of six and fourteen years shall have the right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

The court, however, refused to interfere in the government's decision, stating that it was not illegal or unreasonable. The court noted that the college was being run temporarily from the premises of a government school, which had excess accommodation and was not compromising the functioning of the school. The court allowed the construction of the college to continue, as all necessary sanctions were expected to be obtained soon.

The court order also addressed the issue of whether higher education is permissible on the premises of a school and whether the government's decision to establish a college at Takipur violated the provisions of the Education Act. The court held that higher education is permissible on the premises of a school and is not prohibited under the Education Act. The court further held that the decision of the State to establish a college is not illegal, arbitrary, or capricious, except for starting construction without obtaining prior permission and sanctions.

The court directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that environmental clearances are obtained within four weeks and construction on forest land will be stopped if clearances are not obtained. The government must establish infrastructure and post staff at both temporary and permanent locations of the college and adhere to guidelines passed by the government. The petitioner has the liberty to approach the court again if needed. The petition is disposed of.

In summary, the court order allows the construction of the college to continue, as all necessary sanctions are expected to be obtained soon. The court also held that higher education is permissible on the premises of a school and is not prohibited under the Education Act. However, the court directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that environmental clearances are obtained within four weeks and construction on forest land will be stopped if clearances are not obtained. The government must establish infrastructure and post staff at both temporary and permanent locations of the college and adhere to guidelines passed by the government. The petitioner has the liberty to approach the court again if needed.
