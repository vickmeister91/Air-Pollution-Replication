In a civil second appeal case between Dhanraj Singh and the State of Rajasthan, the court found that a substantial question of law arose regarding the rejection of the plaintiff's claim based on provisions of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court admitted the case and issued a notice for final disposal and a stay application, both returnable on January 9, 2017. The notices were to be given to the petitioner's counsel.

The case in question involves a dispute between Dhanraj Singh and the State of Rajasthan. Singh had filed a claim under The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, alleging that the State of Rajasthan had violated environmental laws by allowing the construction of a dam in a protected area. The claim was rejected by the lower courts, prompting Singh to file a second appeal.

The court found that a substantial question of law arose in the case, specifically regarding the rejection of Singh's claim based on provisions of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court admitted the case and issued a notice for final disposal and a stay application, both returnable on January 9, 2017. The notices were to be given to the petitioner's counsel.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, is a law that was enacted by the Indian government to provide for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The act provides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal with jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment.

The court's decision to admit the case and issue a notice for final disposal and a stay application is significant because it indicates that the court believes that there is a substantial question of law that needs to be addressed in the case. The court's decision to issue a stay application means that the construction of the dam in question will be halted until the case is resolved.

The case is an important one because it highlights the need for effective enforcement of environmental laws in India. The construction of dams and other infrastructure projects can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is important that these projects are carried out in a manner that is consistent with environmental laws and regulations.

Overall, the court's decision to admit the case and issue a notice for final disposal and a stay application is a positive development for environmental protection in India. It demonstrates the court's commitment to enforcing environmental laws and ensuring that infrastructure projects are carried out in a manner that is consistent with environmental protection.
