The court order pertains to an anticipatory bail application filed by Jeet, who is apprehending his arrest in connection with an offense under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution's case is based on conjectures and surmises, and there is no eyewitness to the incident in which the peacock was allegedly killed. The court allows the bail application and directs that Jeet shall be released on bail if arrested, provided he furnishes a personal bond and two sureties. He must make himself available for interrogation, not make any inducement or threat to any person acquainted with the case, and not leave India without previous permission of the court.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, and Section 51 provides for punishment for offenses under the Act.

Jeet, the applicant, had filed an anticipatory bail application apprehending his arrest in connection with an offense under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act.
