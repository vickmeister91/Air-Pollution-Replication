The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a criminal petition filed by M/S Ghataprabha Sahakari Sakkare, which sought to quash the proceedings in C.C. No.1009/2012 for the offenses under Section 44 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court's decision was based on the submission made by the petitioner's counsel that the Board had issued a consent order on 04.01.2013, which was prima facie untenable. The accused could raise this contention before the trial court.

The case involved allegations of pollution caused by the sugar factory owned by M/S Ghataprabha Sahakari Sakkare. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had issued a show-cause notice to the factory in 2012, alleging that it had violated the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The KSPCB had also initiated criminal proceedings against the factory under Section 44 of the Act.

M/S Ghataprabha Sahakari Sakkare had challenged the criminal proceedings in the Karnataka High Court, arguing that the KSPCB had issued a consent order on 04.01.2013, which had the effect of quashing the criminal proceedings. The petitioner's counsel had argued that the consent order was binding on the KSPCB and the trial court, and therefore, the criminal proceedings should be quashed.

However, the Karnataka High Court rejected this argument, stating that the submission made by the petitioner's counsel was prima facie untenable. The court observed that the consent order was issued by the KSPCB after the criminal proceedings had already been initiated, and therefore, it could not have the effect of quashing the criminal proceedings. The court also noted that the accused could raise this contention before the trial court, and therefore, there was no need to quash the criminal proceedings at this stage.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position regarding the effect of consent orders issued by pollution control boards. The court has held that such orders cannot have the effect of quashing criminal proceedings that have already been initiated. This is an important principle as it ensures that polluters cannot escape criminal liability by obtaining consent orders from pollution control boards.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The case involved allegations of pollution caused by the sugar factory, and the KSPCB had initiated criminal proceedings against the factory for violating the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court's decision reinforces the need for industries to comply with environmental laws and regulations to avoid legal action.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision to dismiss the criminal petition filed by M/S Ghataprabha Sahakari Sakkare is a significant development in environmental law. The court's decision clarifies the legal position regarding the effect of consent orders issued by pollution control boards and reinforces the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The accused can raise the contention regarding the consent order before the trial court, and the criminal proceedings will continue.
