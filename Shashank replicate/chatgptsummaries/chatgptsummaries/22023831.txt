The court order pertains to three separate cases, all of which involve requests for copies of certain documents in criminal cases. In the first case, Manoj Babulal Duggar filed a criminal revision application against an order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Ahmedabad. Duggar had filed an application under Sections 91, 207 and 373(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, requiring the respondents to supply copies of certain documents. The respondents contended that the documents were not seized and not in their possession. The revisional court modified the order to the effect that if the respondents were in possession of the documents, they may be supplied, and if not, necessary affidavits be filed. The petitioner had been raising the plea in various proceedings that the respondents were in possession of the documents in question. The court observed that the conduct of the petitioner deserved serious consideration, as on one or the other ground, the petitioner had continued to raise the grievance with respect to the number of files seized during the search and non-supply of some documents.

In the second case, a petitioner dealer had requested copies of certain documents from the respondents, who were accused in a criminal case. The trial court had ordered the respondents to provide the copies, but they had refused, claiming that the documents were never seized. The revisional court modified the order, stating that if the respondents did not have the documents, they should file an affidavit to that effect. The petitioner challenged this order, but the court dismissed the revision application, stating that the affidavit would not prejudice the rights of the accused and that the trial court should expedite the case and decide it within six months.

In the third case, the accused has been ordered to cooperate with the trial. It is unclear from the summary what specific documents were being requested in this case, but it appears that the accused was not cooperating with the trial in some way.

Overall, these cases all involve requests for copies of documents in criminal cases, and the courts have ordered the respondents to provide the documents if they are in their possession or file an affidavit stating that they are not. The courts have also emphasized the importance of cooperation in criminal trials and have ordered the cases to be expedited and decided within a certain timeframe.
