The court order pertains to the management of biomedical waste in hospitals and healthcare facilities in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner, Dr. J. Umarani, filed a writ petition as a Public Interest Litigation seeking a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to take appropriate steps towards effective implementation of Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 1998, and as amended in GSR 343(E) dated 28.03.2016, including the issuance of licenses to any person or the concerned authorizing to treat the category, bio-medical Waste viz., soiled linen, beddings, and items contaminated with blood or body fluid. The petitioner, a doctor with 32 years of experience, claims that the non-issuance of licenses to treat biomedical waste is posing a serious threat to the environment and public health.

The court order discusses the issue of hospitals not properly disposing of soiled linens, which can lead to health hazards and contamination of water bodies. The petitioner argues that hospitals are not properly educated on the impact of washing soiled linens and are not following the rules for proper disposal. The government argues that they have authorized common biomedical waste treatment facilities and have rules in place for the proper disposal of soiled linens. The court notes that soiled linens are not considered biomedical waste under the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, but should still be properly disinfected and washed. The government hospitals have laundry facilities and committees in place to ensure proper disposal and infection control measures.

The court order requires that blood samples and blood bags be disinfected or sterilized on-site according to WHO or NACO guidelines and then sent to a common biomedical waste treatment facility for final disposal. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has approved 11 common biomedical waste treatment facilities, and the state has been instructed to comply with the provisions of the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. The rules prescribe duties for the occupier, common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facility, and authorities. The waste generated from healthcare facilities is treated through these facilities, and discarded linen, mattresses, and beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid are collected and subjected to incineration.

The court order outlines rules for the treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. It requires segregation of biomedical waste from other waste, labeling of containers, and transportation only in authorized vehicles. A prescribed authority will be established in each state to grant authorization for handling biomedical waste. Every occupier of an institution generating biomedical waste must apply for authorization, and a fee must be paid with the application. An advisory committee will be established in each state/union territory.

The court order requires every state and union territory to form an advisory committee consisting of experts in medical and health, animal husbandry, environmental management, and other related fields, including non-governmental organizations. The committee will advise the government on the implementation of rules related to biomedical waste. Every occupier/operator must submit an annual report on the biomedical waste handled, and authorized persons must maintain records related to the handling of biomedical waste. Any accidents must be reported to the prescribed authority. The order also includes a schedule of categories of biomedical waste and their treatment and disposal methods.

The court order outlines guidelines for the disposal of biomedical waste, including chemical waste and the use of incinerators. It also specifies color coding and container types for different categories of waste. The order sets standards for incinerators, including combustion efficiency and emission standards. The government has issued an order for the constitution of committees for biomedical waste management, with duties and responsibilities outlined in the order.

The Health and Family Welfare Department issued a court order on July 6, 2016, regarding the management of biomedical waste. The order calls for the constitution of District and Hospital Level Committees to monitor biomedical waste management. The committees will be chaired by the District Collector and Hospital Superintendent/Chief Medical Officer, respectively, and will include various members such as the Dean of Medical College and the Nursing Superintendent/Head Nurse/Senior Nurse. The order is based on the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000 and 2016.

The court order outlines the formation of a Bio Medical Management Committee responsible for managing and monitoring the proper segregation, storage, transport, and disposal of biomedical waste in hospitals in Tamil Nadu. The committee includes members from various organizations, and the Director of Medical and Rural Health Services is appointed as the state-level coordinator. The order also outlines the responsibilities of the committee members, including the proper segregation and storage of waste, transport to a Common Treatment Facility, and regular reporting to the State Pollution Control Board. Hospital superintendents and chief medical officers are responsible for applying for authorization, forming the committee, providing resources, and appointing a medical officer to supervise the functioning of the waste management system.

The court order requires the provision of resources and manpower to appoint a Medical Officer to supervise the functioning of waste management in a hospital. The Medical Officer is responsible for ensuring the availability of waste disposal bags and chemical disinfectants, as well as the implementation of waste management at various levels. The Nursing Superintendent is responsible for continuous monitoring of waste management throughout the hospital. Doctors and paramedical staff are required to follow proper waste management procedures, including wearing protective gear and ensuring compliance during ward visits.
