The Madras High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Pethakkal against the District Collector and other respondents regarding the illegal functioning of a brick kiln in Kalappakulam Village, Sankarankovil Taluk, Tirunelveli District. The petitioner argued that the inaction of the respondents in regard to her representation submitted on May 31, 2016, suffers from mala fides and as such, the court should interfere in the interest of justice. The petitioner also argued that the brick kiln did not satisfy the norms prescribed by the National Emissions Standards Notified under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986.

The court heard both sides and dispensed with the notice to the eighth respondent to avoid an avoidable delay. The court also observed that the petitioner's representation is pending on the file of the Respondent Nos.1 to 7, without any progress or significant disposal. The court order directs the police station in Sankaran Koil Taluk to look into a pending representation from the petitioner and dispose of it within six weeks, adhering to principles of natural justice. The petitioner is also directed to provide any requested records or documents and assist in the matter. The order is addressed to various government officials and agencies involved in the subject matter. No costs are awarded.
