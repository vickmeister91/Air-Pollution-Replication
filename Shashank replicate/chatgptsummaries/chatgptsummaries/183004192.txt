The National Green Tribunal considered a case where a partnership firm sought to establish a stone crushing unit in Bilaua, Tehsil Dabra, District Gwalior. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board denied the grant of a no objection certificate due to a school being located 450 meters from the site, which did not meet the guidelines issued by the Board. The applicant challenged the legality of the guidelines, arguing that they do not have the force of law and that the expression "residential area" used in the guidelines does not include running a school. The respondent argued that the guidelines were binding and had been formulated in furtherance of a Supreme Court judgment. The Tribunal referred to the relevant extracts of the guidelines and ultimately held that the guidelines were binding and that the applicant could not take advantage of their own wrong.

The court order pertains to guidelines issued by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board for stone crushers to obtain NOC from local bodies and follow air pollution control measures.

The court also cites a previous Supreme Court judgment that banned stone crushers and quarries within 500 meters of residential areas. The guidelines are binding on the Board and all concerned parties.

The court order discusses guidelines issued by the State Board for stone crushers in Madhya Pradesh to control pollution. The guidelines are valid and binding on all concerned.

The court concludes that such activities must be restricted to protect the health and well-being of citizens.
