The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Harjeet Singh Khurana under Section 483 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petition sought to set aside the orders of the trial court passed in Complaint Case No. 4835/2014 filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

The petitioner had objected to the trial court's direction to produce documents that were not relevant and pertained to a third party. The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the affidavit of the petitioner's mother to be submitted by the petitioner and exempted her from appearing in court. The order of the court below was modified accordingly.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The complainant in this case had alleged that the petitioner had issued a cheque that was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in his account. The trial court had directed the petitioner to produce certain documents that were not relevant to the case and pertained to a third party. The petitioner had objected to this direction and had filed the petition under Section 483 of the Cr.P.C. to set aside the orders of the trial court.

Section 483 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the power of the High Court or any other court to which such power may be transferred, to call for and examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior court.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the affidavit of the petitioner's mother to be submitted by the petitioner and exempted her from appearing in court. The court held that the documents that were sought to be produced by the trial court were not relevant to the case and pertained to a third party. Therefore, the trial court's direction to produce these documents was set aside.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the principle of relevance in legal proceedings. The court held that only relevant documents should be produced in court and that the production of irrelevant documents would only serve to delay the proceedings and cause unnecessary hardship to the parties involved.

The court's decision to allow the affidavit of the petitioner's mother to be submitted by the petitioner and exempt her from appearing in court is also significant. This decision recognizes the importance of protecting the rights of witnesses and ensuring that they are not unduly harassed or inconvenienced during legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case sets an important precedent for legal proceedings in India. It upholds the principle of relevance in legal proceedings and recognizes the importance of protecting the rights of witnesses. The court's decision to allow the affidavit of the petitioner's mother to be submitted by the petitioner and exempt her from appearing in court is also significant and reflects a commitment to ensuring that legal proceedings are conducted in a fair and just manner.
