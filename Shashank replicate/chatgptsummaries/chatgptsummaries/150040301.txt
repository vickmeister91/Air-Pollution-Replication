The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to cases where individuals suffered harm or death due to hazardous or dangerous activities, specifically related to the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity. In each case, the court held the responsible parties strictly and absolutely liable for the harm caused, emphasizing the importance of implementing safety measures and regulations to protect the public.

In the first court order, a woman died due to electrocution from an unprotected high tension wire. The court held both the energy corporation and the state government liable to pay compensation to the victim's family and ordered the removal of high tension electric wire lines from public places and residential houses. The court also directed the implementation of safety measures as laid down in different rules and acts, citing regulations that specify measures for protecting the public from dangers arising from the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity.

The second court order outlines regulations for safe supply of electricity, including requirements for cables, service lines, and electrical equipment. The regulations specify that all equipment must be constructed, installed, protected, worked, and maintained in a manner that ensures the safety of humans, animals, and property. The court notes that the appellant did not fulfill the requirements for safe electricity supply under the regulations, emphasizing the importance of pleading and proving facts with evidence in writ petitions and counter-affidavits.

The third court order discusses various legal principles related to liability in cases of hazardous or dangerous activities. It cites previous cases and legal doctrines to establish that enterprises engaged in such activities have an absolute and non-delegable duty to ensure the safety of those affected by their actions. The court emphasizes that liability in such cases is strict and absolute, and not subject to exceptions. The order also notes that the law must evolve to keep pace with changing social and economic conditions, and that courts should not be constrained by legal precedents from other countries.

The fourth court order establishes the principle of strict liability, which holds enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities strictly and absolutely liable for any harm caused to individuals as a result of accidents in the operation of such activities. The court rejects the defense of the management of the Board that someone committed mischief by siphoning energy to their private property and that the electrocution was from such diverted line. The court emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the managers of the supply system to prevent such pilferage by installing necessary devices. The court also notes that even if all safety measures have been adopted, a person undertaking an activity involving hazardous or risky exposure to human life is liable under the law of torts to compensate for the injury suffered by any other person, irrespective of any negligence or carelessness on the part of the managers of such undertakings.

Finally, the fifth court order discusses the Doctrine of Strict Liability and its application in cases where an activity involving hazardous or risky exposure to human life causes harm or death, regardless of negligence or callousness on the part of the responsible party. The court held that under this doctrine, the New Delhi Municipal Corporation was responsible for the death of a man who was electrocuted while walking on a road, and ordered them to pay compensation to the man's legal heirs. The court also modified a previous judgment to require the responsible party to cover conductors/cables passing through public places with insulating material and follow safety measures laid down in different rules and regulations. The judgment and order of the learned Single Judge were upheld, and the appeal was dismissed.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of implementing safety measures and regulations to protect the public from harm caused by hazardous or dangerous activities, particularly related to the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity. They establish the principle of strict liability, holding responsible parties strictly and absolutely liable for any harm caused, regardless of negligence or callousness. The court orders also highlight the need for the law to evolve to keep pace with changing social and economic conditions, and for courts to not be constrained by legal precedents from other countries.
