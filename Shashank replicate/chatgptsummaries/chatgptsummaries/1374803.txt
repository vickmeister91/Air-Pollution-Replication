The Kerala High Court recently issued a court order in a case involving teachers working in schools managed by the Guruvayoor Devaswom. The teachers were accused of being appointed illegally, and the government conducted an investigation and issued an order to initiate action against those responsible for the irregularities. The teachers challenged the order, claiming it violated the principles of natural justice and that the government had no jurisdiction to issue such an order.

However, the court rejected their arguments, stating that the rule of natural justice is not a shield to protect illegality and that the government has the power to supervise and administer the affairs of a temple. The court also clarified that the management must examine each case on its own merits and decide whether the appointments should be annulled, cancelled, or modified.

The court order further stated that teachers who have been appointed should be given show cause notices and an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made based on a vigilance enquiry report. The management can use materials collected during the enquiry for any proceeding, but the appointments of the petitioners cannot be terminated until a final decision is made.

The writ petitions filed by the teachers have been disposed of by the court. The court order has significant implications for the management of schools managed by the Guruvayoor Devaswom and for the teachers working in these schools.

The court's decision to reject the teachers' arguments that the government had no jurisdiction to issue an order to initiate action against those responsible for the irregularities is significant. It reaffirms the government's power to supervise and administer the affairs of a temple, including the management of schools managed by the temple.

The court's clarification that the rule of natural justice is not a shield to protect illegality is also significant. It emphasizes that the principles of natural justice cannot be used to protect illegal appointments or actions.

The court's order that teachers who have been appointed should be given show cause notices and an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made based on a vigilance enquiry report is also significant. It ensures that the teachers have a fair opportunity to defend themselves and present their case before any decision is made.

The court's order that the appointments of the petitioners cannot be terminated until a final decision is made is also significant. It ensures that the teachers are not unfairly penalized before a final decision is made based on the enquiry report.

Overall, the court order in this case has significant implications for the management of schools managed by the Guruvayoor Devaswom and for the teachers working in these schools. The court's decision to uphold the government's power to supervise and administer the affairs of a temple and its clarification that the rule of natural justice is not a shield to protect illegality are important precedents. The court's order that teachers should be given show cause notices and an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made based on a vigilance enquiry report and that the appointments of the petitioners cannot be terminated until a final decision is made are also important safeguards for the teachers.
