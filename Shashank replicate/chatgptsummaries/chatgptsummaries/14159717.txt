The Madras High Court recently issued two court orders related to environmental pollution in Tamil Nadu. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by K. Nandhagopal against the District Collector and other officials, seeking action against S.K. Engineering Industries for causing pollution. The petitioner had alleged that the industry was causing air and water pollution, and that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had failed to take action against it.

The TNPCB had already issued directions to the industry to shift its activities to a new location within six months and ensure that its activities do not cause complaints from the nearby public. The court disposed of the petition on the condition that the petitioner's right to seek redressal against non-compliance by the industry within the given time limit is not fettered. This means that the petitioner can approach the court again if the industry fails to comply with the TNPCB's directions within the stipulated time.

The second court order lists the names and positions of four officials in Tiruvallur district: the Revenue Divisional Officer, the Tahsildar of Gummidipoondi Taluk, and the Block Development Officer of Gummidipoondi Taluk. The order is related to a case with the reference number W.P. No. 31304 of 2019 and was issued on December 13, 2019. The details of the case are not clear from the court order, but it appears to be related to environmental pollution as well.

Environmental pollution is a serious issue in Tamil Nadu, with many industries and other sources of pollution causing harm to the environment and public health. The TNPCB is responsible for monitoring and regulating pollution in the state, but it has been criticized for its lax enforcement of environmental regulations. The Madras High Court has been proactive in addressing environmental issues in the state, and has issued several orders in recent years to curb pollution and protect the environment.

In the case of S.K. Engineering Industries, the court's order is a welcome step towards holding polluting industries accountable for their actions. The TNPCB's directions to the industry to shift its activities to a new location and ensure that its activities do not cause complaints from the nearby public are reasonable and necessary measures to protect the environment and public health. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to seek redressal if the industry fails to comply with these directions is also important, as it ensures that the industry cannot simply ignore the TNPCB's orders without consequences.

In the second court order, the details of the case are not clear, but it is likely that the court is addressing another instance of environmental pollution. The fact that the court has named specific officials in the order suggests that it is holding them accountable for their role in allowing pollution to occur. This is an important step towards ensuring that government officials are held responsible for their actions (or inaction) in addressing environmental issues.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the Madras High Court's commitment to protecting the environment and public health in Tamil Nadu. By holding polluting industries and government officials accountable for their actions, the court is sending a strong message that environmental pollution will not be tolerated in the state. It is important for the TNPCB and other government agencies to take note of these orders and take proactive steps to address environmental pollution in the state.
