The court order pertains to an appeal against an order passed by the Judge, Family Court, dismissing an application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The appellant had sought to recall the respondent for further cross-examination, but the application was dismissed by the lower court. The appellant had then filed an appeal against this order.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, determined that the appeal was not maintainable against the order passed by the lower court. The court also found that there was no merit in the plea taken by the appellant. The court observed that the application to recall the respondent for further cross-examination was an afterthought and was not made at the appropriate time. The court, therefore, dismissed the appeal.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the lower court had considered the appellant's application and had dismissed it after hearing both parties. The court observed that the lower court had applied its mind to the matter and had given reasons for its decision. The court, therefore, found no reason to interfere with the lower court's decision.

Secondly, the court found that the appellant's plea lacked merit. The court observed that the appellant had not provided any new evidence or information that would warrant the recall of the respondent for further cross-examination. The court noted that the appellant had not been able to show how the respondent's testimony was incomplete or inaccurate. The court, therefore, found no reason to allow the appellant's application.

Thirdly, the court observed that the appellant's application to recall the respondent for further cross-examination was an afterthought. The court noted that the appellant had not made this application at the appropriate time and had only done so after the respondent had completed his cross-examination. The court observed that the appellant had not provided any valid reason for the delay in making the application. The court, therefore, found that the appellant's application was not made in good faith.

In light of these factors, the court dismissed the appeal. The court observed that the lower court had considered the matter and had given reasons for its decision. The court found that there was no merit in the plea taken by the appellant and that the application to recall the respondent for further cross-examination was an afterthought. The court, therefore, upheld the lower court's decision and dismissed the appeal.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to an appeal against an order passed by the Judge, Family Court, dismissing an application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court found that the appeal was not maintainable and that there was no merit in the plea taken by the appellant. The court also found that the application to recall the respondent for further cross-examination was an afterthought and dismissed the appeal. The court's decision was based on several factors, including the lower court's decision, the lack of merit in the appellant's plea, and the fact that the application was made as an afterthought. The court, therefore, upheld the lower court's decision and dismissed the appeal.
