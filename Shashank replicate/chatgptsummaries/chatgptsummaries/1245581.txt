The Madras High Court recently heard a case involving S.I.V. Industries Limited and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The petitioner company had complied with all conditions except one, which they claimed was not feasible due to the technology available. The respondent issued a show cause notice and subsequently ordered the closure of the pulp plant due to the effluent exceeding tolerable limits. The petitioner challenged the order, claiming that they were not given a fair hearing and that the respondent did not exhaust remedial measures before ordering closure.

The court ultimately did not elaborate on the arguments presented and instead focused on the show cause notice and the measures taken by the petitioner to reduce pollution. The court found that the show cause notice was issued in accordance with the law and that the petitioner had taken some measures to reduce pollution. However, the court also noted that the petitioner had not exhausted all possible remedial measures before the closure order was issued.

The court ordered that the closure order be set aside and that the petitioner be given an opportunity to propose feasible solutions to comply with pollution control standards. The court also directed the respondent to consider the proposals made by the petitioner and to take a decision within a reasonable time frame. The court further directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of money as a guarantee for the implementation of the proposed solutions.

In another case, the court discussed a situation where a company had been discharging effluent that did not meet pollution control standards into a river, causing serious pollution problems and affecting the lives of nearby residents. The company had taken some measures to improve their effluent treatment plant, but these had not been sufficient.

The court ordered the company to be given an opportunity to propose feasible solutions to comply with pollution control standards and reduce the color of the effluent. The court also allowed a workers union to be impleaded as a party and allowed a petition from individuals affected by the pollution to be considered.

The court recognized the importance of protecting the environment and the health of the people living in the area. The court also recognized the importance of balancing the interests of the company and the community. The court ordered the company to take immediate steps to reduce pollution and to propose feasible solutions to comply with pollution control standards.

Finally, the court order with the case number 12226 of 1995 has been approved. The details of this case are not provided, but it is likely that it involved a decision or order that was being reviewed or appealed.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court has demonstrated its commitment to protecting the environment and the health of the people living in the area. The court has recognized the importance of balancing the interests of the company and the community and has ordered companies to take immediate steps to reduce pollution and to propose feasible solutions to comply with pollution control standards. The court has also allowed workers unions and individuals affected by pollution to be impleaded as parties and to have their petitions considered. These court orders serve as a reminder to companies that they must comply with pollution control standards and take steps to reduce pollution, and that they will be held accountable if they fail to do so.
