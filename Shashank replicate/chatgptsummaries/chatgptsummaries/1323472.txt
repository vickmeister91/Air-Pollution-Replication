The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Rairu Distillers Limited and others under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing a complaint filed against them under Sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners argued that the complaint could not be filed by the Regional Officer of the M.P. Pollution Control Board unless the Board had specifically designated him to do so. However, the court found that the Board had passed a resolution authorizing its officers to file complaints on its behalf, and therefore the complaint was maintainable. The court directed the Trial Court to proceed with the trial.

The case involved allegations of pollution caused by Rairu Distillers Limited and others. The M.P. Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners under Sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners had challenged the maintainability of the complaint on the ground that the Regional Officer of the Board could not file the complaint unless he had been specifically designated to do so.

The court examined the relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the rules made thereunder. It noted that Section 33 of the Act provides for the procedure for handling complaints of pollution. Section 41 provides for the power of the Board to take samples of water for analysis, and Section 43 provides for the power of the Board to issue directions for the prevention, control or abatement of pollution.

The court also examined the resolution passed by the Board authorizing its officers to file complaints on its behalf. The resolution stated that the officers of the Board were authorized to file complaints under Section 33 of the Act, and that they could also take samples of water for analysis and issue directions for the prevention, control or abatement of pollution under Sections 41 and 43 of the Act.

The court held that the resolution passed by the Board was valid and authorized its officers to file complaints on its behalf. It noted that the resolution was passed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. The court also observed that the Board was a statutory body created under the Act, and that it had the power to take all necessary steps for the prevention and control of pollution.

The court rejected the petitioners' argument that the Regional Officer of the Board could not file the complaint unless he had been specifically designated to do so. It held that the resolution passed by the Board authorized all its officers to file complaints on its behalf, and that the Regional Officer was one such officer. The court also noted that the petitioners had not challenged the validity of the resolution passed by the Board.

In light of these findings, the court held that the complaint filed by the Regional Officer of the Board was maintainable. It directed the Trial Court to proceed with the trial. The court also observed that the petitioners could raise any objections they had to the maintainability of the complaint before the Trial Court.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissed a petition filed by Rairu Distillers Limited and others challenging the maintainability of a complaint filed against them under Sections 33, 41 and 43 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court held that the complaint was maintainable as the Board had passed a resolution authorizing its officers to file complaints on its behalf. The court directed the Trial Court to proceed with the trial.
