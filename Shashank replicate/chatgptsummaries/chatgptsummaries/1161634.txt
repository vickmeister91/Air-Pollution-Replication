The Supreme Court of India reviewed a case filed by the Orissa State (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Board against M/s Orient Paper Mills for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The charges were initially quashed by the Addl. Sessions Judge Rourkela, and the decision was upheld by the Orissa High Court. However, the Supreme Court found that the State Government had not prescribed the manner in which an area is to be declared as an Air Pollution Control Area, as required by Section 19 of the Act. The Court also noted that the State Government had issued notifications declaring certain areas as Air Pollution Control Areas, but these notifications did not comply with the Act's requirements. Therefore, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the lower court's decision.

The appellant argued that a valid notification cannot be published in the official gazette without prescribed rules for declaring an area as an air pollution control area. However, the court found that the use of the word "as" in the relevant statute allows for some flexibility in the manner of declaration. The court also cited previous cases to support the idea that the absence of rules does not necessarily divest the state of its power to declare an area as an air pollution control area. The respondent cited a case to argue that the use of the word "may" in the statute means that the manner of declaration must be prescribed. Another case was cited to support the idea that the word "may" can sometimes mean "shall."

The court order discussed a case related to the meaning of the word "may" in a provision and concluded that it was not relevant to the present case. The absence of rules does not render the Act inoperative, and the power to declare an area as an air pollution control area can still be exercised by the State Government through a notification published in the official gazette. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in revision and the order of the High Court affirming the same. The further proceedings in the case are to be resumed in the trial court in accordance with the law on merits.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the need for the State Government to prescribe the manner in which an area is to be declared as an Air Pollution Control Area. The Court's decision clarifies that the absence of rules does not necessarily divest the state of its power to declare an area as an air pollution control area, but the State Government must comply with the Act's requirements when issuing notifications. The Court's decision also emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutory provisions in their proper context and considering previous case law when interpreting the meaning of words and phrases used in the statute.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to comply with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and to ensure that notifications issued by the State Government comply with the Act's requirements. The Court's decision also highlights the importance of interpreting statutory provisions in their proper context and considering previous case law when interpreting the meaning of words and phrases used in the statute.
