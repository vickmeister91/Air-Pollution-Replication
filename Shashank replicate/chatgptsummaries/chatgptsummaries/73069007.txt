The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Sri Pradeep Gorpadu against Smt Divya Pradeep. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) in Crl.RP No. 25043/2013 by the Sessions Court (FTC-III), Mayo Hall Unit, Bangalore.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, it appears that the Sessions Court had passed an order under this section, and the petitioner was seeking to challenge that order.

However, before the matter could be heard by the court, the petitioner's advocate filed a memo seeking leave to withdraw the petition. The court granted this request, and as a result, I.A.No.1/2013 was disposed of. No costs were awarded in the matter.

It is not clear from the available information why the petitioner sought to withdraw the petition. It is possible that the petitioner may have reached a settlement with the respondent, or that there may have been some other reason for the withdrawal.

In any case, the court's order indicates that the matter has been resolved and that no further action is required. It is worth noting that the court did not award any costs in the matter, which suggests that it did not find either party to be at fault.

Overall, this court order appears to be a relatively straightforward matter in which the petitioner sought to challenge an order passed by the Sessions Court under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, before the matter could be heard, the petitioner withdrew the petition, and the court disposed of the matter without awarding any costs.
