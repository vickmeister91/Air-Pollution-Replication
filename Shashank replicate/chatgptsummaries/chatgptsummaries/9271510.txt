The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Bhagirath and Pappu, who were seeking regular bail in a case registered against them for offenses under Sections 379, 411, 120-B Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 29/51, 29/52 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioners had previously jumped bail but were now in custody since 13.11.2018.

The court considered the petition and granted bail to the petitioners, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the petitioners will be released from custody, but they must comply with certain conditions set by the Trial Court.

The offenses for which the petitioners were charged are serious in nature. Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code deals with theft, while Section 411 deals with dishonestly receiving stolen property. Section 120-B deals with criminal conspiracy. The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. Sections 29/51 and 29/52 of the Act deal with hunting and poaching of wildlife.

The fact that the petitioners had previously jumped bail was likely a factor that the court considered when deciding whether to grant them bail again. Jumping bail is a serious offense and can result in additional charges and penalties.

It is not clear from the court order what specific conditions the Trial Court will impose on the petitioners as a condition of their bail. However, it is likely that they will be required to appear in court for all scheduled hearings, refrain from committing any further offenses, and possibly surrender their passports or other travel documents.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioners is significant, as it allows them to be released from custody while they await trial. However, the conditions of their bail will be closely monitored by the Trial Court to ensure that they comply with all requirements and do not pose a risk to society.
