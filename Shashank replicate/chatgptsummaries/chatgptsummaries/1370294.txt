The Durgam Cheruvu lake in Hyderabad has been a victim of pollution and degradation due to urbanization. The issue has been brought to the attention of the court through a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by T. Ramakrishna Rao. The court expresses disappointment with the lack of response from the authorities and emphasizes the importance of treating PILs as an opportunity to introspect and take corrective measures.

The allegations made in the PIL are supported by a report from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, which suggests certain directions to prevent further pollution and degradation of the lake. The court orders the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and the Serilingampally Municipality to take necessary measures to prevent the flow of raw domestic effluents into the lake and not permit any more residential colonies in the vicinity.

The Pollution Control Board has suggested that the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board provide sewage treatment systems for existing colonies and prevent the flow of raw domestic effluents into the lake. The court cites the Stockholm Conference and various constitutional provisions to emphasize the duty of the State and its citizens to protect the environment. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, was enacted to address the growing concerns over environmental degradation. The court notes that water, chemical, and air pollutants are degrading the water quality of the Durgam Cheruvu lake and causing harm to nearby residents.

The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and ecology, and issues directions to the respondent-authorities to prevent both conventional and non-conventional water pollutants from reaching the lake. The court also discusses the problem of chemical pollutants and the need for sustainable development that balances economic growth with environmental protection. The court issues specific directions to the A.P. Pollution Control Board to prevent highly polluting industries from setting up in the vicinity of the lake and to ensure that pollutants from existing industries do not reach the lake.

The court order directs various authorities to take measures to prevent pollutants and effluents from reaching the Durgam Cheruvu lake in Hyderabad, India. This includes ensuring that existing industries such as leather tanning do not discharge any pollutants into the water, providing sewage treatment systems for nearby residential colonies, and preventing the construction of new colonies in the catchment area of the lake. The authorities are also directed to strictly follow environmental protection laws and the petitioner or affected persons can seek further directions if necessary. The Chief Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh is to be informed of the order and monitor the authorities' actions. No costs are awarded.
