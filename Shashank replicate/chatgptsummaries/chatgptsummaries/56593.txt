The Orissa High Court recently heard two cases involving the Mahabir Soap and Gudakhu Factory against the Union of India and other parties. The case involved the interpretation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner had not obtained consent under Sections 25 and 26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and was issued a notice to close down the unit and take pollution control measures. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds of lack of opportunity for a personal hearing and non-application of mind by the authorities. The court found that the authorities had not violated the prescribed procedure or the principle of natural justice while exercising their statutory powers.

In the first case, the petitioner had not obtained consent under Sections 25 and 26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and was issued a notice to close down the unit and take pollution control measures. The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds of lack of opportunity for a personal hearing and non-application of mind by the authorities. The court found that the authorities had not violated the prescribed procedure or the principle of natural justice while exercising their statutory powers. The court also upheld the State Board's decision to refuse consent for the petitioner's factory, stating that the reasons given were factual and not unreasonable.

In the second case, the court order pertained to a case where a petitioner claimed that they were not given an opportunity for a personal hearing before the Central Government issued a direction under the Environment (Protection) Act. The court ruled that the provision for an opportunity of hearing only applies when the notice is issued to an officer or authority other than the occupier of the industry, operation, or process. In this case, the notice was issued to the managing partner of the firm, so there was no need to send a copy of the proposed direction to the occupier. The writ applications were dismissed without any order for costs.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of obtaining consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and complying with the prescribed procedures and principles of natural justice while exercising statutory powers. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for clarity in interpreting the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, to avoid confusion and ensure that the rights of all parties involved are protected.

The court's decision in the first case reinforces the importance of obtaining consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, before operating any industrial unit. The Act aims to prevent and control water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies and ensuring that industries comply with the prescribed standards. The court's decision also highlights the need for industries to take pollution control measures to minimize the adverse impact of their operations on the environment.

The court's decision in the second case clarifies the provision for an opportunity of hearing under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Act aims to protect and improve the environment and prevent hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants, and property. The court's decision emphasizes that the provision for an opportunity of hearing only applies when the notice is issued to an officer or authority other than the occupier of the industry, operation, or process. This decision provides clarity on the interpretation of the Act and ensures that the rights of all parties involved are protected.

In conclusion, the court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of complying with the prescribed procedures and principles of natural justice while exercising statutory powers. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for clarity in interpreting the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, to avoid confusion and ensure that the rights of all parties involved are protected. The court's decision reinforces the need for industries to obtain consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and take pollution control measures to minimize the adverse impact of their operations on the environment.
