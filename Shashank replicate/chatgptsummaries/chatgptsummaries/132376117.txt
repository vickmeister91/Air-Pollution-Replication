The first court order pertains to a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, challenging an order by the Additional Collector of Wild Ass Sanctuary, Surendranagar. The petitioner had been granted land on lease for manufacturing salt, but the area was later declared a sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The court examines the provisions of the Act and the notifications issued under it, and ultimately upholds the order recognizing the rights of the petitioner to do any activity in and over the land in question.

The court order begins by stating that the petitioner had been granted land on lease for manufacturing salt, but the area was later declared a sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner challenged the order by the Additional Collector of Wild Ass Sanctuary, Surendranagar, which had denied the petitioner's right to do any activity in and over the land in question. The petitioner argued that the lease agreement was entered into before the area was declared a sanctuary and that the petitioner had a right to continue the activity.

The court examined the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the notifications issued under it. The court noted that the Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and their habitats. The court also noted that the Act provides for the declaration of areas as sanctuaries, national parks, and other protected areas. The court observed that the purpose of declaring an area as a sanctuary is to protect the habitat of wild animals and plants.

The court then examined the notifications issued under the Act. The court noted that the notifications declared the area in question as a sanctuary and prohibited any activity that would disturb the habitat of wild animals and plants. The court observed that the notifications did not specifically mention the lease agreement entered into by the petitioner.

The court then examined the petitioner's argument that the lease agreement was entered into before the area was declared a sanctuary and that the petitioner had a right to continue the activity. The court noted that the lease agreement did not specifically mention the area being declared a sanctuary in the future. The court observed that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that the lease agreement would continue, but that the petitioner's expectation was subject to the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the notifications issued under it.

The second court order determined that the land in question was within the sanctuary area and therefore the petitioners had no rights over it. The lease period had already expired in 2005 and the request for an extension of stay was rejected. The petition was dismissed and the interim relief was vacated.
