In the case of Mohd. Yunus, who was accused of using his vehicle as a stage carriage without proper documents, the prosecution presented three witnesses. However, the defense argued that all three witnesses were interested parties and no independent witness was examined. The court cited previous judgments and held that the testimony of official witnesses cannot be discarded solely on the basis of the absence of independent witnesses. Ultimately, the court acquitted the accused due to lack of sufficient evidence.

The court order in this case highlights the importance of evaluating police witnesses based on their own merits and not rejecting their testimony simply because they are official witnesses. In this particular case, the accused was charged with violating traffic guidelines, but the prosecution failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The court found that there was no evidence to show that the accused was picking up passengers illegally and that he had valid certificates for his vehicle. Therefore, the accused was acquitted of all charges.

In another case related to Mohd. Yunus, the court acquitted him of all allegations related to not having a valid Certificate of Insurance. The prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt, and the verdict was pronounced on January 24, 2012.

These court orders highlight the importance of presenting sufficient evidence to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt. In the first case, the prosecution failed to present independent witnesses, which weakened their case. However, the court held that the testimony of official witnesses cannot be discarded solely on the basis of the absence of independent witnesses. This is an important reminder that official witnesses can still provide valuable testimony in court.

In the second case, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused was violating traffic guidelines and picking up passengers illegally. The court found that the accused had valid certificates for his vehicle, which further strengthened his case. This case highlights the importance of presenting concrete evidence to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt.

In the third case, the prosecution failed to prove that Mohd. Yunus did not have a valid Certificate of Insurance. This case emphasizes the importance of presenting all necessary documents and evidence to prove a case in court.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder that presenting sufficient evidence is crucial in proving a case beyond reasonable doubt. It is also important to evaluate official witnesses based on their own merits and not reject their testimony solely because they are official witnesses. These principles ensure that justice is served and that innocent individuals are not wrongly convicted.
