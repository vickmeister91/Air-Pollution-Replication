The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail made by K.G. Raveendran Nair, who is the second accused in a case related to the Wild Life Protection Act. The first accused was caught with the skin of a tiger and revealed that he had received it from the petitioner. The petitioner claims innocence and argues that there is no material to connect him with the crime.

However, the court dismisses the application for anticipatory bail and directs the petitioner to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate and then seek regular bail in the usual course. The court also observes that if the petitioner applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor, the learned Magistrate must pass orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.

The case in question involves allegations of violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, which is a serious offense. The court has taken note of the fact that the first accused was caught with the skin of a tiger and has revealed that he received it from the petitioner. This is a strong indication of the petitioner's involvement in the crime.

The petitioner, however, claims innocence and argues that there is no material to connect him with the crime. The court has considered this argument but has found it unconvincing. The court has noted that the first accused has specifically named the petitioner as the person who gave him the tiger skin. This is a strong piece of evidence against the petitioner.

In light of these facts, the court has dismissed the application for anticipatory bail. The court has directed the petitioner to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate and then seek regular bail in the usual course. This means that the petitioner will have to go to the police station or the court and surrender himself. He will then have to apply for regular bail, which will be considered on its merits.

The court has also observed that if the petitioner applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor, the learned Magistrate must pass orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. This means that the petitioner will have to give prior notice to the Prosecutor before applying for bail. The learned Magistrate will then have to consider the bail application on its merits and pass orders in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail made by K.G. Raveendran Nair, who is the second accused in a case related to the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has dismissed the application for anticipatory bail and directed the petitioner to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the learned Magistrate and then seek regular bail in the usual course. The court has also observed that if the petitioner applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor, the learned Magistrate must pass orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.
