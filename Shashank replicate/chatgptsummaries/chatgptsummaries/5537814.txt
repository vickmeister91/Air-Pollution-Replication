In a recent court order, the case between Keshar Singh and Ms. Chaudhary Autovotives Pvt Ltd was addressed. The petitioner's counsel argued that since the trial had concluded, the petition to challenge the order passed by the trial court had become irrelevant and should be disposed of. The court agreed with this argument and ordered accordingly.

The case in question was a criminal case, which means that it involved an alleged violation of criminal law. The specifics of the case are not provided in the court order, but it is clear that the trial had already taken place and a verdict had been reached. The petitioner, Keshar Singh, had apparently filed a petition to challenge the order passed by the trial court.

The petitioner's counsel argued that since the trial had already concluded, the petition to challenge the order was no longer relevant. This argument makes sense, as the purpose of such a petition is typically to challenge a decision made during the trial process. Once the trial has concluded and a verdict has been reached, there is no longer any decision to challenge.

The court agreed with the petitioner's counsel and ordered that the petition be disposed of. This means that the petition will not be considered further and the case is effectively closed. It is unclear from the court order whether any further legal action is possible in this case, but it seems unlikely given that the trial has already concluded.

Overall, this court order is relatively straightforward. It simply confirms that a petition to challenge a trial court order has become irrelevant due to the conclusion of the trial. While the specifics of the case are not provided, it is clear that the court has made a decision that effectively closes the case.
