The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad recently upheld the confiscation of a truck for violating Sections 60 and 72 of the United Provinces Excise Act, 1910. The owner of the seized truck appealed against the order, arguing that only the Magistrate who conducted the trial was competent to pass an order of release of the vehicle. However, the High Court held that the Act is a special and local Act to deal with the properties seized under the Act, and the provisions contained in the Code with regard to disposal of property can be used only to the extent they are not inconsistent with Section 72 of the Act.

The Supreme Court reviewed some provisions from the Act to appreciate the arguments. The court order discusses the power of the Collector to confiscate seized items or animals, even if a prosecution has not been instituted. The order can be reviewed if there is a mistake, and an appeal can be made to a judicial authority. Confiscation is not considered a punishment, and the order of the court is required for the disposal of the confiscated item or animal. The argument that the order of the court is required for confiscation is rejected. The court also discusses the power of an Excise Officer to investigate and seize articles and vehicles involved in the commission of a crime.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 72 of the Act, which deals with the confiscation of vehicles or other things. The Collector has exclusive jurisdiction to order confiscation or impose a fine not exceeding the market value of the thing on the date of seizure. The power to sell the thing or animal pending confiscation proceedings is also contemplated if it is expedient in public interest to do so. The distribution of sale proceeds after the thing or animal is sold is contemplated by sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act. The court also notes that the power of release of the property produced before any criminal court whether interim or final in terms of Sections 451, 452 or 457 of the Code will not be available to court except the order in respect of distribution of sale proceeds. The court concludes that the provisions of the Act regarding disposal of the property are contrary to the provisions contained in the Code.

In another court order, it was stated that the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 has provisions for the confiscation or release of seized vehicles, and that no court has jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used in commission of any offence under the Act. The Collector has exclusive jurisdiction to confiscate vehicles and may order the sale of seized things subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay. The High Court has the power of judicial review over the order of confiscation passed by the Collector. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

In summary, the court orders discussed the power of the Collector to confiscate seized items or animals, even if a prosecution has not been instituted. Confiscation is not considered a punishment, and the order of the court is required for the disposal of the confiscated item or animal. The court also discussed the power of an Excise Officer to investigate and seize articles and vehicles involved in the commission of a crime. The provisions of Section 72 of the Act were also discussed, which deals with the confiscation of vehicles or other things. The Collector has exclusive jurisdiction to order confiscation or impose a fine not exceeding the market value of the thing on the date of seizure. The court concluded that the provisions of the Act regarding disposal of the property are contrary to the provisions contained in the Code. Finally, the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 has provisions for the confiscation or release of seized vehicles, and that no court has jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used in commission of any offence under the Act.
