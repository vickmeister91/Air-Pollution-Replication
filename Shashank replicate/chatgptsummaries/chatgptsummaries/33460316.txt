The Madras High Court recently issued a common judgment on three related cases involving Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam, LA Bottlers Private Ltd., and various government entities. The cases involved unauthorized construction of a factory by LA Bottlers and petitions for action to be taken against the company. The court referred to LA Bottlers as the petitioner company and all other parties by their names.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the classification of land for a bottling unit owned by L.A. Bottlers Private Ltd. The company had purchased land classified as "Mixed Residential Zone" and applied for reclassification to "Controlled Industrial Zone" to set up the bottling unit. The application was rejected by the government, citing public resentment and unrest. The company had obtained various permissions and licenses from different authorities, except for the change of land classification. The main issue was the drawal of groundwater in large quantities from borewells, causing depletion of water table in a drought-stricken area. The court remitted the matter of reclassification to the government for fresh consideration after evaluating public perception vis-a-vis the rule of law.

The court order also pertains to a windmill installation and a factory construction in Suriyur village, Tamil Nadu. The petitioner company had obtained permission to draw water from six borewells, but the permission expired in 2015. The company had also constructed the factory building without proper plan approval and was operating it without a running license. The court disposed of the writ petition, permitting the seventh respondent to apply to the local body for permission under Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. The court also remitted the matter to the Government of Tamil Nadu for fresh consideration of the request for reclassification of land use. The court observed that public perception cannot be overlooked, especially when the reclassification of land use is not in tune with the interest of the public.

The court order states that the petitioner company, LA Bottlers Private Limited, did not have the necessary approvals for the construction and installation of their factory. The company also did not have a valid land conversion approval or building plan approval. The court also noted that the company's usage of water was depleting the water table, and their undertaking to not draw water from their own wells was not a long-term solution. The court ordered the closure and sealing of the factory and the removal of unauthorized construction. The court also noted that the objections raised by several related departments were a major factor in the decision.

The court order discusses a dispute over the use of land and water resources by a company in Tamil Nadu. The company had applied for land use conversion and had been accused of drawing excessive amounts of groundwater without authorization. Various parties, including local residents and government officials, had raised objections and filed petitions. The court ultimately remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration, taking into account the objections and relevant statutory provisions. The court also noted that public interest is important, but rules of governance cannot be violated.

The court order states that the second respondent acted in accordance with the law by rejecting an application for land use conversion. The court considered objections and relevant statutory provisions. The appellant argued that permissions granted by the local body were invalid without approval from the DTCP, and that public interest should be the paramount consideration. The court reviewed various documents and certificates issued to the first respondent, including a No Objection Certificate, permission to construct, and licenses to store compressed gas and import and store petroleum. The court also noted objections from the local body and public, and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board's consent for operation of the plant with conditions. The court ultimately upheld the rejection of the application for land use conversion.

The court order discusses a dispute over the operation of a factory in Suriyur Village, Tamil Nadu. The factory had obtained various licenses and approvals from different authorities, but the local body had not obtained permission from the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) for land usage conversion. The court considered the legality of the sealing of the factory by the government due to public agitation and law and order concerns. The court found that the sealing was not justified solely on these grounds and that the factory had obtained necessary licenses and approvals. The court also noted that the local body had issued a No Objection Certificate for the factory's operation and that the DTCP could still grant post-facto approval. The court ultimately rejected the government's decision to seal the factory and ordered that it be allowed to operate.

The court order lists permitted uses for two different zones: Primary Residential Use Zone and Controlled Industrial Use Zone. The order also references the importance of balancing environmental protection with industrialization and the concept of sustainable development. The court ultimately dismisses a writ appeal and two writ petitions, stating that the industrialization will not be adversely affected and that the law must be respected. The order is addressed to various government officials and the managing director of LA Bottlers Private Ltd.

In summary, the Madras High Court issued a common judgment on three related cases involving Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam, LA Bottlers Private Ltd., and various government entities. The cases involved unauthorized construction of a factory by LA Bottlers and petitions for action to be taken against the company.
