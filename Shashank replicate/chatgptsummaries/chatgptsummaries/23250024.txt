The court order pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed by Sujin and others challenging the proceedings in C.C.No.42 of 2015 pending on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II, Kuzhithurai, Kanyakumari District. The final report has been filed in both the cases on the ground that the respondent Police was not able to find out who was the real aggressor in the case. The court cannot undertake an exercise in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to deal with the infirmities that have been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners. The police must investigate both the cases and find out the aggressor and file the final report against the aggressor. Such a procedure is not illegal.

The court order discusses PSO 19 588-A, which outlines the procedure for investigating complaints and counter complaints arising from the same transaction. Failure to follow this procedure has been the subject of debate in previous court cases, with some arguing that it is an illegality that vitiates conviction, while others view it as only a directory. The court ultimately concludes that PSO 588A has statutory force and failure to follow it is bad in law. However, there have been differing opinions on this matter in previous court cases. Justice Arunachalam ultimately concludes that the judgment of the apex court must be followed.

The court order states that police standing orders cannot override the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that administrative instructions in P.S.O. 588A are only directory and not mandatory. It is not illegal to file a final report in both a case and a counter case, and the investigating officer was right in placing all materials before the trial court. The court must now examine the proper procedure to be followed during the trial.

The court order refers to a judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nathi Lal v. State of UP, which states that in cases where there are cross cases and the investigating officer is unable to determine the real aggressor, a simultaneous trial must be conducted in both cases by the same judge. The evidence recorded in one case cannot be looked into in the other case, and both cases must be decided based on the evidence presented in each case. The court order directs the learned Judicial Magistrate -II, Kuzhithurai to conduct a simultaneous trial in two cases and complete the proceedings within four months. The presence of some respondents may be dispensed with, and they shall be represented by a counsel.
