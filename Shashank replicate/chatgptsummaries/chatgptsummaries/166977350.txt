The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The specific details of each case are not provided in the summary. However, the court heard all the petitions together and decided them by a common judgment.

One of the petitions involved a controversy over the demand notice issued by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, for the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The petitioners sought various reliefs, including the quashing of the demand notice and the refund of the amount deposited as NPV. The court provided a detailed background of the case, including the diversion of forest land for mining activity, the compensation paid for the same, and the subsequent demand for NPV.

Another petition discussed a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cited a government letter stating that the compensation provisions do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argued that the cluster of mining leases has been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and therefore the compensation should be paid by the remaining lease holders.

Another petition pertained to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to issue directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court found that the mining lease holders refused to segregate cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for individual forest land held by each lease holder, along with their share in the common area used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The court excluded the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases.

Overall, the court order dealt with various issues related to mining leases and forest clearances in the State of Rajasthan. The court heard multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies and decided them by a common judgment. The court provided a detailed background of the cases and directed the respondents to take appropriate actions in each case. The court's decision aimed to ensure that the mining activities do not harm the environment and that the compensation is paid to the rightful parties.
