Ram Dayal, also known as Rajjan Verma, has been granted bail by the court after being in custody since June 21, 2015, in connection with a wildlife protection case. The applicant's counsel argued that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety to ensure his presence during the trial.

The case against Ram Dayal involves allegations of violating wildlife protection laws. The prosecution has accused him of being involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products, including tiger skins and bones. The prosecution has also alleged that Ram Dayal was involved in the killing of a tiger in the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan.

Ram Dayal has denied all the allegations against him and has maintained his innocence throughout the trial. His counsel argued that there is no evidence to support the prosecution's claims and that the case against him is based on hearsay and conjecture.

The court considered the arguments put forward by both the prosecution and the defense and ultimately decided to grant bail to Ram Dayal. The court noted that the applicant has been in custody for a significant period of time and that there is no evidence to suggest that he is a flight risk or that he will tamper with evidence.

The court also directed Ram Dayal to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety to ensure his presence during the trial. This is a standard requirement in bail applications and is intended to ensure that the accused attends all court hearings and does not abscond.

The decision to grant bail to Ram Dayal has been welcomed by his family and supporters. They have maintained his innocence throughout the trial and have been campaigning for his release for several years.

The case against Ram Dayal is just one example of the challenges faced by wildlife protection authorities in India. The illegal trade in wildlife products is a lucrative business, and many individuals are involved in this trade. The authorities have been working to crack down on this trade and to protect endangered species such as tigers, but progress has been slow.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Ram Dayal in connection with a wildlife protection case. The decision to grant bail was based on the arguments put forward by the defense, which maintained that Ram Dayal is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. The court directed Ram Dayal to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety to ensure his presence during the trial. The case against Ram Dayal highlights the challenges faced by wildlife protection authorities in India and the need for greater efforts to protect endangered species.
