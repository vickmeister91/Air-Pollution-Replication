The skin was recovered from his possession during a joint raid conducted by the Wild Life Inspectors and Police officials.

The court rejected the defense's argument of false implication and material contradictions in the prosecution's case. The co-accused Srikant was already discharged from the case.

The court order states that a raid was conducted and leopard skin was seized from the accused. The non-joining of witnesses is not fatal to the prosecution case, and the recovered skin was identified by a wildlife inspector. The accused's argument that the case property was not sealed at the spot and was not sent for expert opinion is not considered fatal to the prosecution's case. The accused is convicted for contravening the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The judgment is available on the court's website.
