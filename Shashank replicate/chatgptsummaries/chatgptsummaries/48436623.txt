On November 11, 2019, the Madras High Court issued a common order in response to multiple writ petitions filed against the Union of India and the State of Tamil Nadu regarding an order passed in G.O.(Ms)No.84, dated 25.6.2018, related to the use of cups made of polypropylene. The petitioners sought a writ of declaration or a writ of certiorarified mandamus to declare the order as unconstitutional, illegal, and ultra vires. The court order involves multiple aspects, including the constitutionality of the order, the enforcement of waste management rules, and the delegation of power to state governments.

The court order declares that the inclusion of cups made of polypropylene over 60 Micron thickness is unconstitutional and illegal. The respondents are directed to enforce and implement Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The court also orders the prohibition and phase-out of open garbage disposal systems and removal of open garbage receptacles. The court rejects the challenge to the impugned G.O.Ms.No.84, dated 25.6.2018, as unconstitutional.

The court found that the State Government's order in G.O.Ms.No.84 was in the public interest and aligned with Article 48(A) of the Constitution of India, which aims to protect and improve the environment. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 superseded the Plastic Waste Management Act Handling Rules 2011, but did not supersede a previous notification from 1998. The court also stated that when one authority delegates power to another authority, it does not lose the ability to exercise that power. However, in this case, the power under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act can be delegated to state governments, and the State of Tamil Nadu has been given this power.

The writ petitions were dismissed, and no costs were awarded. The court order pertains to a case with multiple petitions (W.P(MD)NO.25031 of 2018, W.P(M)Nos.1621 and 2057 OF 2019, and W.M.P(MD)Nos.1379, 1380, 1661,1662 of 2019 and 22687,22688 of 2018) and a common order has been made by T.S.SIVAGNANAM, J. and R.THARANI, J. The order is addressed to the Principal Secretary/Chairman of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the address is given as No.76, Mount Salai, Guindy, Chennai â€“ 600 032. The court has not yet made a decision on the matter.

In summary, the Madras High Court issued a common order in response to multiple writ petitions filed against the Union of India and the State of Tamil Nadu regarding an order passed in G.O.(Ms)No.84, dated 25.6.2018, related to the use of cups made of polypropylene. The court found that the State Government's order in G.O.Ms.No.84 was in the public interest and aligned with Article 48(A) of the Constitution of India, which aims to protect and improve the environment.
