These charges include offenses under the Indian Penal Code, M.M.R.D. Act, J.M.M. Act, Indian Forest Act, Wild Life Protection Act, and Explosive Substance Act. The prosecution case is based on a written report by the informant, alleging that the petitioner and others were involved in illegal quarrying and theft of stone chips using explosives.
