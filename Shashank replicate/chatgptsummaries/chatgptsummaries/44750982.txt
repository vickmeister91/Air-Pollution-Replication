Mrs. Miekyung Koak, a Korean national, was apprehended at Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore for possessing a horn of a Chital Deer. She was arrested and charged under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner claimed that the proceedings were misconceived as there was no offense committed by her under the Act. She produced a report by the National Centre for Biological Sciences, which revealed that the sample was allegedly an antler matching the DNA of the Chital Deer, an animal classified at Schedule III of the Act. The court found that the entire proceedings were misconceived and quashed them, allowing the release of the petitioner's passport.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, or capturing of wild animals, and it also regulates the trade in wildlife and their products. The Act classifies animals into different schedules based on their level of protection, with Schedule I providing the highest level of protection.

In this case, Mrs. Koak was charged under the Act for possessing a horn of a Chital Deer, an animal classified at Schedule III of the Act. The prosecution argued that possession of any part of a Schedule III animal without a valid permit is an offense under the Act. However, the petitioner argued that the horn in question was not from a Chital Deer and that the prosecution had failed to prove that it was.

The petitioner produced a report by the National Centre for Biological Sciences, which revealed that the sample was allegedly an antler matching the DNA of the Chital Deer. The report was submitted to the court, and the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the horn in question was from a Chital Deer. The court also found that the entire proceedings were misconceived and quashed them, allowing the release of the petitioner's passport.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of proper investigation and evidence gathering in wildlife-related cases. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and it is essential that the law is enforced effectively to ensure their conservation. However, it is equally important that the law is not misused to harass innocent individuals.

In this case, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the horn in question was from a Chital Deer, and therefore, the entire proceedings were misconceived. The court's decision is a reminder that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, and they must provide sufficient evidence to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for wildlife conservation in India. It reinforces the importance of proper investigation and evidence gathering in wildlife-related cases and ensures that innocent individuals are not harassed or wrongly convicted. It also highlights the need for effective enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, to ensure the conservation of India's rich biodiversity.
