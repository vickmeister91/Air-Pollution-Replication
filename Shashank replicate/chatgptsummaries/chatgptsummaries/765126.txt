The court order pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Koshy Thomas under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thomas is accused of violating Section 2 of the Wild Life Protection Act by keeping a male peacock in a cage at his residence. The court has granted anticipatory bail to Thomas, subject to certain conditions.

The court has considered the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution has argued that Thomas has committed a serious offence by keeping a protected species in captivity, and that he may tamper with evidence or influence witnesses if granted bail. The defense, on the other hand, has contended that Thomas is a law-abiding citizen with no criminal record, and that he has been falsely implicated in the case.

After considering these arguments, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Thomas. However, the bail is subject to certain conditions. Firstly, Thomas must report to the investigating officer as and when required. Secondly, he must not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses in any manner. If he violates any of these conditions, his bail may be cancelled.

The court has also taken note of the fact that Thomas has cooperated with the investigation so far, and has voluntarily surrendered the peacock to the authorities. This indicates that he has no intention of evading the law or obstructing the investigation. Therefore, the court has deemed it fit to grant him anticipatory bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Koshy Thomas, who is accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act by keeping a male peacock in captivity. The bail is subject to certain conditions, including reporting to the investigating officer and not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses. The court has taken into account the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense, and has deemed it fit to grant bail to Thomas.
