The court recently granted bail to Naved Zama Khan in a criminal case where he was accused of killing a NeelGai. The court considered several factors before making this decision, including the fact that there was no allegation against the applicant in the statement of the deceased and that he had no criminal history.

It is important to note that the court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case. Instead, the decision to grant bail was based solely on the evidence presented and the circumstances surrounding the case.

One of the key factors that the court considered was the lack of evidence linking the applicant to the crime. According to the statement of the deceased, there was no mention of the applicant being involved in the killing of the NeelGai. This lack of evidence was a significant factor in the court's decision to grant bail.

Another important factor that the court considered was the applicant's criminal history. In this case, the applicant had no prior criminal record, which was seen as a positive factor in his favor. The court recognized that individuals with no criminal history are less likely to pose a threat to society and are more likely to comply with the conditions of their bail.

Despite these factors, the court did not grant bail unconditionally. Instead, the applicant was required to furnish a personal bond with two sureties. This condition was put in place to ensure that the applicant would comply with the conditions of his bail and would not pose a threat to society.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Naved Zama Khan was based on a careful consideration of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding the case. While the court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case, it recognized that the applicant had no criminal history and that there was no evidence linking him to the crime. As a result, the court felt that it was appropriate to grant bail on the condition that the applicant comply with certain conditions to ensure the safety of society.
