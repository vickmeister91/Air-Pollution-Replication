The court order describes a case involving accused individuals and a drug inspection. Accused No. 3 was sent a sample for analysis, and accused No. 4 requested a second sample be sent to the Central Laboratory. The report from the Central Laboratory found that the drug contained less of the substance than what was listed on the label. Accused No. 4 supplied information about the quantity of the drug produced and the names of directors. The court found that the accused individuals had not appointed a managing director and had not delegated any power to one.

The court order discusses the grounds on which an order of issue process is challenged. The court finds that there is sufficient evidence to infer that the order was made and summons were issued against the accused. The court also notes that the accused had knowledge of the summons but did not appear in court. The court discusses the provision of Section 34 of the Act and the law developed under this provision, which states that every person in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of a company shall be deemed guilty of an offense committed by the company. However, they may not be liable if they prove that the offense was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent it.

The court order discusses the liability of directors, managers, secretaries, or other officers of a company in cases where an offence has been committed with their consent or neglect. The order cites various cases where this issue has been discussed and provides examples of when relief was granted or refused. The order also mentions the provisions of various acts, including the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act.

The court order discusses the similarities between section 34 of the Weights Measurement (Enforcement) Act and section 17 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. It states that both acts have similar objectives, but the forms and contents of the licenses under these two acts are different. The court also mentions that the appointment of chemists and officers is a condition of the license, and the business is conducted by directors. The court compares the provisions of the Negotiable Instrument Act with the provisions of the Act and states that they cannot be compared as they have different procedures and objectives. The court also discusses section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and how it is similar to section 34 of the Act.

The court order discusses a complaint against a pharmaceutical company and its directors for manufacturing and selling a medicine that was found to have fungus in it.

The court distinguishes this case from a previous case where the complaint did not link the directors to the manufacturing process. The court also refers to specific paragraphs in the complaint that describe the roles and activities of the accused directors and the company.

The court order MB/05/268 granted on 17.3.2006 and valid until 16.3.2011 pertains to the manufacture and distribution of "Hemfer syrup" by accused no.4 to 10.

The court order pertains to a case where 10 individuals were involved in manufacturing a substance called "Hemfer syrup" and a sample was collected by the Drugs Inspector. The court found that all the directors were involved in the manufacturing process and therefore there were no specific allegations against the present petitioners. The court also cited a previous case where the provision regarding commission of offence by a company and its directors was considered and the facts of the said case were similar. The court observed that proceedings against an accused in the initial stages can be quashed only if on the face of the complaint or the papers accompanying the same, no offence is constituted.

The court also discusses the discretionary powers of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and section 482 of Cr.P.C. The court notes that while there is power under section 20-A of the Act to implead manufacturers, distributors, or dealers during trial, in cases where the directors of the company are involved, specific provisions like section 17 need to be used. The court emphasizes that the object behind the Act is to reach the real culprit and prevent adulteration of
