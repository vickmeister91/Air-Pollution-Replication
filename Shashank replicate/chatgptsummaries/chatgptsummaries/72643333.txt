In two separate court orders, individuals were convicted for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first case involved Ali Shehar, also known as Sher, who was found guilty of illegal possession of two monkeys. The accused failed to provide any legal source of procurement for the recovered monkeys, and the prosecution presented evidence and witnesses to support their case. Despite pleading not guilty, Shehar was convicted and sentenced to judicial custody. The court found that the accused had violated the provisions of the Act and that the monkeys were government property.

In the second case, the court order stated that any ivory obtained through illegal means would be the property of the government, and any animal hunted in a sanctuary or national park would be the property of the central government. The order also prohibited the acquisition, possession, transfer, or destruction of government property without written permission. The accused in this case was found guilty of possessing two monkeys, which are protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and was convicted for contravening Section 49 of the Act. The court found the testimony of police witnesses to be credible and sufficient for conviction, and non-joining of public witnesses was not considered fatal to the prosecution case.

These court orders highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and government property. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, was enacted to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds, and to regulate hunting, possession, and trade in wildlife. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In the first case, Shehar was found guilty of violating the Act by possessing two monkeys without any legal source of procurement. The court's decision to convict and sentence him to judicial custody sends a strong message that illegal possession of wildlife will not be tolerated. The Act aims to protect endangered species and their habitats, and individuals who violate its provisions will face legal consequences.

Similarly, in the second case, the accused was found guilty of possessing two monkeys, which are protected under the Act. The court's decision to convict the accused for contravening Section 49 of the Act reinforces the importance of protecting wildlife and government property. The Act provides for the protection of not only endangered species but also their habitats and ecosystems. The court's decision to uphold the Act's provisions sends a clear message that individuals who violate its provisions will face legal consequences.

The court orders also highlight the importance of credible witness testimony and evidence in supporting prosecution cases. In both cases, the prosecution presented evidence and witnesses to support their case, and the court found their testimony to be credible and sufficient for conviction. The non-joining of public witnesses was not considered fatal to the prosecution case, indicating that the court relied on the evidence presented by the prosecution to arrive at its decision.

In conclusion, the court orders convicting individuals for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and government property. The Act provides for the protection of endangered species and their habitats, and individuals who violate its provisions will face legal consequences. The court's decision to convict and sentence the accused in these cases sends a strong message that illegal possession of wildlife will not be tolerated. The court's reliance on credible witness testimony and evidence also reinforces the importance of supporting prosecution cases with strong evidence.
