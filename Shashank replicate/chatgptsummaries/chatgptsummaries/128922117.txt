The court system is often used to settle disputes and make decisions that affect the public interest. However, there are times when individuals abuse the system for personal gain or political motives. In such cases, the court must be careful to ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not as a busybody or meddlesome interloper. The court must also be careful not to encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature.

One such case involved a petitioner seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to conduct comprehensive field studies, public hearing and cost benefit analysis, through reputed experts from Road Transport and Finance fields, regarding the proposal for the construction of a flyover on Oddanchathram to Avinashipalayam State Highway (SH-37) under the Tamilnadu Road Sector Project-II including alternative solutions, if any, and to accordingly modify / abandon the proposal for the construction of flyover at the proposed site on larger public interest. The respondents argued that the proposed flyover was necessary to ease traffic congestion and maintain safety of the fast-moving vehicles and pedestrians. The court ultimately sided with the respondents and dismissed the petition.

In another case, the court ordered the construction of a flyover at the Pollachi junction to improve traffic flow and pedestrian safety. The decision was made after conducting various surveys and receiving public consent, including from local officials and representatives. The flyover will have a four-lane divided carriageway and will cover the Dharapuram Bus stand area. The width of the flyover was revised to minimize land acquisition and demolition of buildings. The court emphasizes the importance of genuine public interest in public interest litigation and warns against abusing the process for personal gain or political motives.

The court also discussed the abuse of public interest litigation (PIL) by individuals with personal motives, which has led to a flood of frivolous PILs clogging up the court system. The court emphasizes that PIL should only be used in rare cases involving the public interest of large numbers of people who cannot afford litigation. The court also sets out guidelines for entertaining PILs, including verifying the credentials of the petitioner and the seriousness of the information provided. The court warns against the use of PIL for personal gain or political motives and stresses the importance of filtering out frivolous petitions to avoid wasting valuable judicial time. The court cites several previous cases to support its position.

In yet another case, the court dismissed a writ petition against the construction of a flyover at a certain location, stating that the respondents have conducted a detailed study and considered the views of the public. The petitioner's claims of improper study and incompetence are countered by the respondents. The court finds no merit in the writ petition and orders it to be dismissed without costs. The order is to be issued to various government officials.

In conclusion, the court system plays a crucial role in ensuring that decisions are made in the public interest. However, it is important to ensure that the system is not abused for personal gain or political motives. The court must be careful to ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not as a busybody or meddlesome interloper. The court must also be careful not to encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature. The court should filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage unscrupulous litigants from invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court for personal matters under the guise of public interest litigation.
