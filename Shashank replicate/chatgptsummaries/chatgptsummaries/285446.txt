The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by 62 workmen against the State of Haryana and Whirlpool of India Limited. The workmen were aggrieved by the order granting permission to the company to close down its 'Evaporator Section' under Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The company had to introduce new technology to compete with other companies and reduce the cost of production, which required a reduction in manpower. The company decided to switch to roll bond evaporators, which required the closure of the Evaporator Section. The court rejected the petitioners' claims and upheld the order granting permission to close down the section.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, which outlines the procedure for closing down an industrial establishment. The court rejects the defendant's objections to the maintainability of the writ petition and the delay in filing it. The court explains that an individual workman has the right to challenge an order that affects them personally, even if the union has taken up their cause. The court also notes that the availability of an alternative remedy does not preclude the exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court then examines the merits of the case and explains the requirements of Sub-Sections (1) and (2) of Section 25-O. The court concludes that the appropriate government's decision to grant permission for closure and dismiss the review application of the union is in accordance with the law.

The court order discusses a petition filed by workers who were terminated when their company closed down a section of its operations. The workers argued that the company did not follow proper procedures for obtaining permission to close the section and violated a settlement agreement with the workers' union. The court rejected these arguments, finding that the company had followed the necessary procedures and that the closure was justified by statutory requirements and economic considerations. The court also noted that the workers had alternative remedies available to them under the Industrial Disputes Act.

The court order discusses the closure of the Evaporator Section of a company due to the phase-out of conventional clinch tube type evaporators and the introduction of more energy-efficient roll bond evaporators. The company did not have the technological expertise to manufacture the new evaporators and had to purchase them from a Spanish company. The court found that the closure of the Evaporator Section was justified and fulfilled the legal requirements for closure. The court also rejected the argument that the Evaporator Section was not an industrial establishment or undertaking. The court cited previous judgments but noted that they were not dealing with the current provisions applicable for closure.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by 62 employees of Whirlpool of India, who were affected by the company's decision to close down its Evaporator Section. The employees challenged the government's order granting permission to the company to close down the unit, citing violations of the Industrial Disputes Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and allowed the employees' application to be added as writ petitioners. The company raised objections to the maintainability of the writ petition, citing the principle of collective bargaining and the employees' failure to challenge the government's order through a review petition. The court left all objections open to the company and scheduled a notice of motion for August 11, 2005.

The court order discusses Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, which outlines the procedure for closing down an undertaking. It requires an employer to submit an application for permission to close down an undertaking, which must be served simultaneously on the representatives of the workmen. The appropriate government must then make an enquiry and give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to both the employer and the workmen. The order granting or refusing permission is final and binding on all parties and will remain in force for one year. The court rejected the petitioners' argument that they were not given a full opportunity to represent themselves and make their submissions before the authorities and the appropriate government. The employer had submitted an application for permission to close down the Evaporator Section, which was granted based on the statutory mandate to discontinue the use of gases that deplete the ozone layer.

The court order states that the closure of a unit does not necessarily mean the closure of the entire business of the employer. The Evaporator Section in question was found to be an independent unit and the company was within its rights to close it down. The court also found that the company did not violate the settlement agreement with the union as it had the sole prerogative to bring about changes in production facilities. The court dismissed the petition and ordered the company to pay compensation to the affected workers.

In summary, the court orders discussed various writ petitions filed by workmen and employees of Whirlpool of India, who were affected by the company's decision to close down its Evaporator Section. The court examined the provisions of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, which outlines the procedure for closing down an industrial establishment or undertaking. The court rejected the petitioners' claims that the company did not follow proper procedures for obtaining permission to close the section and violated a settlement agreement with the workers' union. The court found that the closure of the Evaporator Section was justified and fulfilled the legal requirements for closure. The court also noted that the workers had alternative remedies available to them under the Industrial Disputes Act.
