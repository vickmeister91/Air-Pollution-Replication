The High Court recently dismissed a criminal original petition filed by N. Ganeshan against M. Palanisamy. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the court below dismissing his petition filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner was facing trial for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and had filed the petition to summon two witnesses and seek certain documents. The court below had dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioner had no inclination to proceed with the trial and was trying to protract it by filing one petition after another.

The High Court found no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the trial court and dismissed the petition. The court directed the court below to complete the proceedings within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. The court also closed a related motion.

The case pertains to a cheque bounce case where the petitioner, N. Ganeshan, had allegedly issued a cheque to M. Palanisamy, which was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. M. Palanisamy had then filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act against N. Ganeshan. During the trial, N. Ganeshan had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to summon two witnesses and seek certain documents. However, the court below had dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioner was trying to protract the trial.

The High Court, while dismissing the petition, observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to examine the witnesses whose statements he wanted to summon. The court also noted that the petitioner had filed multiple petitions to delay the trial. The court held that the trial court had rightly dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner.

The High Court also directed the court below to complete the proceedings within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. The court emphasized that the trial court should ensure that the trial is conducted expeditiously and without any unnecessary delay.

The order was issued on January 21, 2019, and should be sent to the Judicial Magistrate Fast Track Court in Tirupur. The court's decision is a reminder that the judiciary is committed to ensuring that trials are conducted expeditiously and without any unnecessary delay. The court's direction to complete the proceedings within two months is a clear indication that the judiciary will not tolerate any attempts to delay the trial process. 

In conclusion, the High Court's decision to dismiss the petition filed by N. Ganeshan and direct the court below to complete the proceedings within two months is a welcome move. The court's decision sends a strong message that the judiciary is committed to ensuring that trials are conducted expeditiously and without any unnecessary delay. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a deterrent to those who try to delay the trial process and that it will help in the speedy disposal of cases.
