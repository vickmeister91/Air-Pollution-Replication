The High Court of Jharkhand recently issued three court orders that highlight the importance of respecting and protecting the authority of the courts and ensuring compliance with court orders. The first court order pertains to a contempt petition filed by Vishal Prasad against the State of Jharkhand and others for not removing encroachments made on the property of Zila Parishad, Dhanbad, despite a court order. The court observed that there appears to be a tacit consent of the authorities in such illegal activities of continuing encroachment over public property and directed the Registrar General to lodge an FIR with the Vigilance Department of the State to investigate the irregularities and illegalities in such matters. The court also drew attention to the recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court delivered in the case of Maninderjit Singh Bitta Vrs. Union of India and others and directed the State Government to develop a mechanism for implementation of the High Court orders. The court also noted that approximately 1592 civil contempt cases are pending in the High Court of Jharkhand.

The second court order emphasizes the importance of respecting and protecting the dignity and authority of the courts in order for the judiciary to effectively perform its duties and functions. Public interest litigations are particularly significant, and the courts are called upon to interfere when the state and its instrumentalities have failed to discharge their statutory functions or have acted adversely to the larger public interest. The purpose of the court's jurisdiction is to punish those who have disobeyed or not carried out court orders and to ensure compliance with future orders. Lethargy, ignorance, official delays, and absence of motivation cannot be offered as a defense in a contempt action. The court issues a direction to the State Government to implement the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the State of Jharkhand in its true spirit and to take contempt matters seriously. The State Government is also directed to immediately evolve the process for addressing contempt petitions and to provide monthly statements with respect to pending contempt cases. The order is to be given to all bodies of the State Government and other authorities who are State within the definition of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The matter is posted for further review on a specific date.

The third court order emphasizes the duty of the judiciary to ensure that all individuals and institutions, including the executive and legislature, act within the framework of the law and the fundamental law of the land. It also criticizes the practice of undue delay in complying with court orders and warns against a lackadaisical attitude towards them, which could become contumacious if it continues. The order cites previous cases to support these points.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of respecting the authority of the courts and ensuring compliance with court orders. The judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of citizens. It is essential that all individuals and institutions, including the executive and legislature, act within the framework of the law and comply with court orders. Failure to do so can result in contempt proceedings and other legal consequences. The State Government of Jharkhand is directed to take these matters seriously and to develop mechanisms for addressing contempt petitions and ensuring compliance with court orders.
