The first court order involves a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by the Irrigation and Flood Control Department of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi against M/S Nav Nirman Construction Company. The case concerns the construction of an outfall structure of DDA storm water drain at RD 12418 mtrs. of Supplementary Drain (L/B). The work was awarded to Nav Nirman Construction Company, but the work was not completed on time due to various hindrances caused by the Petitioner. The learned Arbitrator found that the breach of the contract was by the Petitioner and awarded various claims to Nav Nirman Construction Company.

The arbitrator allowed some claims and rejected others, and the court finds no grounds for interference with the arbitrator's decision. The court notes that the arbitral record was destroyed in a fire and had to be reconstructed, and that the central issue concerned the applicability of certain clauses and specifications. The court also addresses specific objections raised by the petitioner regarding certain claims made by the respondent.
