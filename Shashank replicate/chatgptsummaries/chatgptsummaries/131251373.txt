In a recent court order, Enabul Khan, the petitioner, sought anticipatory bail in connection with a wildlife protection case. The prosecution alleged that Khan was involved in the killing of a Sambhar and that the head of the animal was recovered from his house. The petitioner's counsel argued that the offence report was submitted by an incompetent person and that some of the accused persons had already been granted anticipatory bail.

The court considered the arguments presented by both parties and directed the petitioner to deposit Rs. 10,000 in the court concerned within three weeks and file the payment receipt in the court. This order was made in light of the fact that some of the accused persons had already been granted anticipatory bail, and the court wanted to ensure that the petitioner would not abscond or evade the law.

The case highlights the importance of wildlife protection and the need for strict enforcement of laws related to the same. The killing of animals for sport or other purposes is a serious offence and can have severe consequences for those involved. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to some of the accused persons and direct the petitioner to deposit a sum of money in court is a reminder that the law will not tolerate such actions.

It is also important to note that the court considered the arguments presented by both parties before making its decision. This is a crucial aspect of the legal system, as it ensures that justice is served and that all parties are given a fair hearing. The court's decision to direct the petitioner to deposit a sum of money in court is a reasonable one, as it ensures that the petitioner will not abscond or evade the law.
