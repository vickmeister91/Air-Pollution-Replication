The Tamilnadu Magnesite Ltd filed a writ petition challenging the order of the Union of India rejecting their application for declaring the lay-off period from 19.02.1997 to 27.03.1997. The petitioner had initially made an application on 24.02.1997 under Section 25(M) of the Industrial Disputes Act, seeking permission for the above said period. The request was rejected on 15.04.1997 and again on 11.07.1997. The court had set aside the order passed by the first respondent and directed the first respondent to pass fresh orders and remitted the matter back to the first respondent for fresh consideration. The impugned Order came to be passed on 18.07.2003, wherein the first respondent rejected the application for permission for lay-off.

The court order pertains to Section 25(M) of the Industrial Disputes Act, which deals with lay-offs. This section provides for the procedure to be followed by an employer who wishes to lay off workers. It states that if an employer applies for permission for a lay-off and does not receive a response within 60 days, the permission is deemed to be granted. The order of the appropriate government or authority is final and binding for one year, but can be reviewed or referred to a tribunal. If no permission is granted, the lay-off is deemed illegal and the workers are entitled to benefits. The section also allows for exceptions in cases of accidents or death of the employer.

In the case at hand, the petitioner had applied for permission for a lay-off for the period from 19.02.1997 to 27.03.1997. The request was rejected on two occasions, and the petitioner had filed a writ petition challenging the rejection of their application. The court had set aside the order passed by the first respondent and directed the first respondent to pass fresh orders and remitted the matter back to the first respondent for fresh consideration. However, the first respondent rejected the application for permission for lay-off on 18.07.2003.

The court dismissed the writ petition challenging the rejection of the request for post-facto permission for a lay-off. The court held that the request did not meet the exceptional circumstances mentioned in Section 25(M) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The court observed that the petitioner had not made any attempt to obtain prior permission for the lay-off, and had only applied for post-facto permission after the lay-off had already taken place. The court noted that the purpose of Section 25(M) was to provide a procedure for employers to follow when they wish to lay off workers, and that the petitioner had not followed this procedure.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that there were exceptional circumstances that warranted the grant of post-facto permission for the lay-off. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that they had made any attempt to obtain prior permission for the lay-off, or that they had faced any unforeseen circumstances that had necessitated the lay-off. The court held that the rejection of the application for post-facto permission for the lay-off was justified, and dismissed the writ petition.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition challenging the rejection of a request for post-facto permission for a lay-off. The court held that the request did not meet the exceptional circumstances mentioned in Section 25(M) of the Industrial Disputes Act, and that the petitioner had not followed the procedure laid down in the section. The court dismissed the writ petition, and upheld the rejection of the application for post-facto permission for the lay-off.
