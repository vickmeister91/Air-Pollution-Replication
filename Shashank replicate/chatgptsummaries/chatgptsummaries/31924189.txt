The State of Maharashtra had filed a criminal appeal against Mansingh Bicchu Banot and two others for killing a blue bull with the help of electric current. The appeal challenged the acquittal of Banot under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court dismissed the appeal, stating that no offense was made out against Banot.

The case revolved around the killing of a blue bull, which is a protected animal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution had alleged that Banot and his accomplices had killed the animal using electric current, which is a prohibited method of hunting. The trial court had acquitted Banot, while the trial of the other two accused was separated, and they were discharged.

The State of Maharashtra had challenged the acquittal of Banot in the High Court, arguing that the trial court had erred in not considering the evidence against him. The State had contended that Banot had admitted to killing the blue bull and that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence to prove his guilt.

However, the High Court dismissed the appeal, stating that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against Banot. The court observed that the prosecution had relied on the confession of Banot, which was not admissible in evidence as it had been obtained under duress. The court also noted that the prosecution had not produced any independent evidence to corroborate the confession of Banot.

The court further observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that Banot had used electric current to kill the blue bull. The court noted that the prosecution had relied on the testimony of a witness who had claimed to have seen Banot using electric current, but the witness had not been able to identify Banot in court. The court also noted that the prosecution had not produced any expert evidence to show that the injuries on the blue bull were consistent with the use of electric current.

The court, therefore, held that no offense was made out against Banot and dismissed the appeal. The court also observed that the trial of the other two accused had been separated, and they had been discharged. The complainant was at liberty to take recourse to the available remedy to prosecute the other two accused when they were apprehended.

The court's decision highlights the importance of producing sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The court has emphasized that the prosecution cannot rely solely on the confession of the accused and must produce independent evidence to corroborate the confession. The court has also emphasized the importance of expert evidence in cases involving technical issues such as the use of electric current to kill an animal.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the criminal appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra against Mansingh Bicchu Banot and two others for killing a blue bull with the help of electric current highlights the importance of producing sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The court has emphasized that the prosecution cannot rely solely on the confession of the accused and must produce independent evidence to corroborate the confession. The court has also emphasized the importance of expert evidence in cases involving technical issues such as the use of electric current to kill an animal.
