On June 13, 2018, Justice Rajesh Shankar of the High Court of Jharkhand in Ranchi issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Pradip Modi against the State of Jharkhand and other officials. The petitioner sought the quashing of a letter issued by respondent No. 3 to respondent No. 5, which directed the latter to act in accordance with the order passed by respondent No. 2, accepting the proposal of respondent No. 3 that no rent receipt can be issued to the petitioner for a particular land. The petitioner also sought a direction to the respondents to issue rent receipt to him for the said land.

The court heard arguments from both sides and observed that once the mutation of any land has been allowed and the rent receipts are being issued since long, the same cannot be stopped without any order passed in accordance with law. The purpose of mutation is to collect government revenue from the person who is in possession of the land, and the revenue authorities are not supposed to look into the right and title of a person upon the said land. The Act, 1980 has been enacted for preventing the use of forest land for non-forest purpose irrespective of the fact that the same belongs to any private individual. However, the Act, 1980 does not put any restriction in issuance of rent receipt to the owner of the said land.

The court clarifies that the Act, 1980 will be applicable to all the land irrespective of the nature of ownership of the land, but it does not prevent issuance of rent receipt in favour of the owner of the land. The court quashes and sets aside the impugned order contained in letter No. 2859(ii) dated 26.10.2009 and directs the respondents to accept the rent from the petitioner for the land in question and to issue update rent receipts in lieu thereof.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rights of landowners to receive rent receipts for their land, even if it is classified as forest land. The Act, 1980 applies to all forests irrespective of the nature of ownership or classification thereof, but it does not prevent the issuance of rent receipts to the owner of the land. The court's decision ensures that landowners are not unfairly deprived of their rights to collect rent for their land.

It is important to note that the court order does not provide any information about the content of the order beyond the details of the writ petition filed by Pradip Modi. However, the order's significance lies in its affirmation of the rights of landowners and the applicability of the Act, 1980 to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification.
