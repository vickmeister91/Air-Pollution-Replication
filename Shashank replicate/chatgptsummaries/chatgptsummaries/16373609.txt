The Kerala High Court recently heard a case between Vodafone Essar Cellular Ltd and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought a direction to consider applications for consent to operate diesel generator sets as backup facilities in telecommunication towers without insisting on payment of consent fees based on the total capital investment incurred for the installation of the entire telecommunication tower and amenities. The court admitted the case and heard both sides on the question of interim relief.

The petitioner, Vodafone Essar Cellular Ltd, argued that the Kerala State Pollution Control Board was insisting on payment of consent fees based on the total capital investment incurred for the installation of the entire telecommunication tower and amenities, which included the diesel generator sets used as backup facilities. The petitioner contended that this was unfair and unreasonable, as the diesel generator sets were only a small part of the overall investment and were necessary for the proper functioning of the telecommunication towers.

The Kerala State Pollution Control Board, on the other hand, argued that the consent fees were necessary to ensure that the telecommunication towers did not cause any harm to the environment. The Board contended that the diesel generator sets used as backup facilities were not exempt from the payment of consent fees, as they were an integral part of the telecommunication towers and contributed to their overall impact on the environment.

The court heard both sides and admitted the case for further consideration. The court also heard arguments on the question of interim relief, which would allow the petitioner to operate the diesel generator sets as backup facilities without paying the consent fees until the final decision of the court.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and observed that the issue involved a question of law and policy. The court noted that the issue had wider implications for the telecommunication industry as a whole, as many other companies were also facing similar problems with the payment of consent fees for diesel generator sets used as backup facilities.

The court also observed that the issue involved a balance between the need to protect the environment and the need to ensure the proper functioning of the telecommunication towers. The court noted that the diesel generator sets were necessary for the proper functioning of the telecommunication towers, but also had an impact on the environment.

The court, therefore, directed the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to consider the applications for consent to operate diesel generator sets as backup facilities in telecommunication towers without insisting on payment of consent fees based on the total capital investment incurred for the installation of the entire telecommunication tower and amenities. The court also directed the Board to take into account the specific impact of the diesel generator sets on the environment and to impose appropriate conditions to mitigate any harm caused by their operation.

The court's decision was seen as a victory for the telecommunication industry, as it provided relief from the burden of paying consent fees based on the total capital investment incurred for the installation of the entire telecommunication tower and amenities. The decision also recognized the importance of diesel generator sets as backup facilities for the proper functioning of telecommunication towers, while also ensuring that their impact on the environment was properly mitigated.

Overall, the Kerala High Court's decision in this case was a balanced and pragmatic approach to a complex issue involving the need to protect the environment and the need to ensure the proper functioning of the telecommunication industry. The decision provided relief to the telecommunication industry while also recognizing the importance of environmental protection.
