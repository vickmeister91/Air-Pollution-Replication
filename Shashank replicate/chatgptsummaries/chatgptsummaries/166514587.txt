Mahendra Gupta, who was arrested on 22 July 2017 for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Arms Act, has been granted bail by the court. The court considered that the charge-sheet had been filed, the trial would take time to conclude, and there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant. The court ordered that Gupta be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial and for complying with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Arms Act, on the other hand, regulates the possession, manufacture, sale, transport, import, and export of arms and ammunition in India.

Gupta's arrest was made in connection with the violation of these two acts. However, the court has granted him bail considering the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed and the trial would take time to conclude. Additionally, the court has taken into account the fact that there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant.

The court has ordered that Gupta be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This is to ensure that he appears before the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during the trial. Additionally, he is required to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

Section 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) deals with the grant of bail in non-bailable offences. Sub-section (3) of Section 437 lays down the conditions that need to be fulfilled by the accused while on bail. These conditions include that the accused shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required, shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer, and shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Mahendra Gupta, who was arrested for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Arms Act. The court has taken into account the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed, the trial would take time to conclude, and there were no criminal antecedents of the applicant. Gupta has been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence before the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial and for complying with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.
