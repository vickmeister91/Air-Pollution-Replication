The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab, Chandigarh issued an order in Consumer Complaint No. 710 of 2017 filed by Krishan Kumar Aggarwal against M/S Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. The complaint alleged that the company failed to deliver possession of a residential plot within the agreed timeframe and demanded compensation. The commission found in favor of the complainant and ordered the company to pay compensation at the rate of Rs. 50/- per sq. yard for every month of delay. The company was also ordered to pay costs of the complaint.

In another court order, the Ops (the company) failed to offer possession of a plot to the complainants within the grace period of 6 months, and as per the agreement, they are liable to pay compensation for every month of delay. The Ops issued a notice of possession, but the complainants found that the development was incomplete and basic amenities were not provided. The complainants filed a complaint seeking a refund of the amount paid, compensation for mental harassment, and other relief. The Ops argued that the complaint is not maintainable and that the matter should be referred to arbitration. The court heard both parties and their evidence and documents and dealt with the preliminary objections. The court found that the complaint is maintainable and dismissed the objections raised by the Ops.

The court order discusses the power of Consumer Fora to entertain complaints even if there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court cites Section 3 of the Act and a recent judgment by the Hon'ble National Commission to support this. The order also defines the term "consumer" under Section 2(1)(d) of the CP Act and concludes that the complainants are consumers as they have availed services from the Ops for consideration. The court rejects the argument that the complainants purchased the plot for speculative purposes and therefore are not consumers. The order also addresses the argument that the allegations in the complaint are contractual in nature and should only be triable in a civil court.

In another court order, the court discusses a consumer complaint regarding the development of a colony and the allotment of Plot No. 106. The complainants allege that the development work was not completed as promised, and the Ops argue that the complaint should be heard in civil court rather than by the Consumer Foras. The court determines that the Consumer Foras have the right to hear the complaint and that the Ops are responsible for completing the project as directors/chairmen. The court examines the evidence and finds that the development work was not complete, and the Ops were not authorized to issue a notice/offer of possession letter without obtaining a partial completion certificate. The court also notes relevant clauses regarding possession and holding charges in the agreement.

In yet another court order, the company was supposed to offer possession of a plot to the allottee within 24 months with a grace period of 6 months, and if they failed to do so, they would be liable to pay compensation. If the delay exceeded 12 months after the grace period, the allottee could opt for termination of the agreement and refund of paid installments. The complainant cannot be compelled to take possession without a completion certificate, and the amenities at the site are incomplete. The court also refers to previous judgments stating that the allottee is entitled to withdraw from the scheme in the event of a delay in completion of the project.

Finally, the court order states that there is a deficiency in service on the part of GMADA, as the amenities at the site are not complete and the storm water pipelines have not been connected with the main service lines. The complainants have the authority to withdraw from the scheme and seek a refund with interest at 12% per annum. The court also awards compensation for physical and mental harassment and litigation expenses. The order must be complied with within 45 days, or the complainants can execute the order through legal means.

In summary, these court orders deal with consumer complaints against real estate companies for failing to deliver possession of plots within the agreed timeframe and for incomplete development work. The courts have found in favor of the complainants and ordered compensation and refunds. The courts have also addressed the power of Consumer Foras to hear complaints even if there is an arbitration clause in the agreement and the definition of "consumer" under the CP Act. The courts have also noted relevant clauses in the agreements regarding possession and holding charges. In one case, the court found a deficiency in service on the part of GMADA and awarded compensation for physical and mental harassment and litigation expenses.
