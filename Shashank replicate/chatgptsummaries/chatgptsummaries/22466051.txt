The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently declined to interfere in a case where a petitioner challenged a show cause notice for violating pollution control laws by running a marriage garden. The court suggested that the petitioner approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT), as the issue falls within its jurisdiction. The court cited a previous order passed by the NGT in a similar case and stated that the NGT is empowered to exercise jurisdiction under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The writ petition was disposed of, and the petitioner was advised to seek remedy before the NGT.

The case in question pertains to a show cause notice issued by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) to the petitioner, who runs a marriage garden, for violating pollution control laws. The petitioner challenged the notice, stating that the MPPCB had not followed due process and had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before issuing the notice. The petitioner also argued that the MPPCB had not taken into account the fact that the marriage garden had taken several measures to control pollution, such as installing a sewage treatment plant and planting trees.

The court, however, did not go into the merits of the case and instead suggested that the petitioner approach the NGT. The court cited a previous order passed by the NGT in a similar case, where the NGT had held that it had jurisdiction to hear cases related to pollution control, and that the NGT Act, 2010, had been enacted to provide for the effective and expeditious disposal of such cases. The court also noted that the NGT had the power to issue directions to any person, authority or government for the prevention and control of pollution.

The court further observed that the NGT had the power to hear appeals against orders passed by the MPPCB, and that the NGT Act, 2010, had been enacted to provide for a specialised forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases related to environmental protection and conservation. The court, therefore, advised the petitioner to approach the NGT for a remedy.

The NGT is a specialised forum that was established in 2010 to hear cases related to environmental protection and conservation. The NGT has the power to hear cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, and to provide relief and compensation for damages caused by violations of environmental laws. The NGT also has the power to issue directions to any person, authority or government for the prevention and control of pollution.

The NGT Act, 2010, provides for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases related to environmental protection and conservation. The Act also provides for the appointment of expert members to the NGT, who have specialised knowledge and experience in the field of environmental protection and conservation. The Act further provides for the establishment of regional benches of the NGT, to ensure that cases can be heard and disposed of in a timely and efficient manner.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court declined to interfere in a case where a petitioner challenged a show cause notice for violating pollution control laws by running a marriage garden.
