The High Court of Kerala recently dismissed an appeal filed by Kent Constructions Pvt. Ltd. against a judgment in WP(C) 28747/2012. The appellant had challenged a communication requiring it to produce environmental clearance to operate a sewage treatment plant. The court found that the appellant could not have commenced construction without permission from the municipality and that the demand for environmental clearance was legal. As a result, the appeal was dismissed.

The case centered around the construction of a sewage treatment plant by Kent Constructions Pvt. Ltd. The appellant had received a communication from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) requiring it to produce environmental clearance to operate the plant. The appellant challenged this communication, arguing that it had already obtained all necessary permissions from the municipality and that the demand for environmental clearance was illegal.

The High Court of Kerala, however, found that the appellant could not have commenced construction without permission from the municipality. The court noted that the appellant had not obtained any permission from the municipality to construct the sewage treatment plant. As a result, the court found that the demand for environmental clearance was legal and dismissed the appeal.

The court's decision highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions before commencing construction. In this case, the appellant had failed to obtain permission from the municipality, which ultimately led to the dismissal of its appeal. The court's decision also underscores the importance of complying with environmental regulations. The KSPCB had required the appellant to produce environmental clearance to operate the sewage treatment plant, and the court found that this demand was legal.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder to developers and construction companies to ensure that they have obtained all necessary permissions and are in compliance with all relevant regulations before commencing construction. Failure to do so can result in legal challenges and delays, as seen in this case.
