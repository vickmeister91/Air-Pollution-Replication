The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to the process of obtaining environmental clearance for various projects and the importance of conducting meaningful and effective public hearings as part of that process.

In the first court order, the court was asked to consider the nature, scope, and methodology of a public hearing held in accordance with a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, as well as whether units manufacturing asbestos-based products should be allowed to function. The court appointed an Amicus Curiae to assist in the case and ultimately concluded that the public hearing conducted in the present case conformed to the nature, scope, and methodology as postulated. However, the court did not address the question of whether the petitioner filed the writ petition as a bona fide public interest litigant. The court also provided background information on the Office Memorandum issued by the Government of India and the National Environment Policy.

The second court order focused specifically on the public consultation aspect of obtaining environmental clearance for a project proposed by Aqua. The court outlined the requirements for conducting a meaningful and purposive public hearing, including adequate notice, availability of relevant information, and a disciplined panel to conduct the hearing. The purpose of a public hearing is to give a voice to the voiceless and provide an opportunity for the community to express their views on a proposed project. The court emphasized the importance of transparency and consultation with affected parties in obtaining social acceptability for a project.

The third court order discussed the procedures that must be followed for a meaningful and effective public hearing, including the need for fair representation and a structured hearing. The court also examined allegations of violence and disruption at a specific public hearing related to a proposed project, ultimately finding that while there may have been some disruption, those opposing the project were given a fair opportunity to express their views. The court also noted that there was no evidence to support the claim that the draft EIA report was not placed on the website of the State Pollution Control Board.

The fourth court order addressed allegations made by Samarth regarding the conduct of a public hearing for an asbestos project. The court accepted the affidavit of the UEPPCB that protestors were given a fair opportunity to express their views but did not avail of it. The court also noted that an independent inquiry committee found that the public hearing was not a sham or a farce, and that the disruption caused by a small group of protestors did not warrant calling off the hearing. The court dismissed the writ petition and ordered Samarth to pay costs to Aqua.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of conducting meaningful and effective public hearings as part of the process of obtaining environmental clearance for projects. The court emphasized the need for transparency, consultation with affected parties, and fair representation in these hearings. While there were allegations of disruption and violence at some of the hearings, the court found that those opposing the projects were given a fair opportunity to express their views. Ultimately, the court dismissed the writ petitions in some cases and ordered the petitioners to pay costs in others.
