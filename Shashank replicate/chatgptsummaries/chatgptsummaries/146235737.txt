The charge sheet in this case was filed on 28th May 2015, and the applicant/accused has been falsely implicated in the case.

The court has taken into consideration the arguments put forth by the applicant's counsel, who has contended that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case and that there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the alleged offence. The counsel has also pointed out that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that his release on bail would not hamper the investigation in any way.

After considering the submissions made by both parties, the court has ordered the release of the applicant/accused on bail. The court has directed the applicant to furnish a bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond for the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The court has also imposed certain conditions on the applicant, which he must comply with while on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on the principle that bail is a rule and jail is an exception. The court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that his release on bail would not hamper the investigation in any way. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has no criminal antecedents and that he is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is also based on the fact that the charges against him are not of a serious nature. The offences under Sections 9/51 and 39/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, are punishable with imprisonment for a term of up to three years and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000.
