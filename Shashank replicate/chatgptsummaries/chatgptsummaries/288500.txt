The case against George V.S. is related to the alleged killing of an Indian wild gaur, which is a protected species under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution claims that George V.S. shot down the animal and shared the meat with others. The incident took place in a forest area in Kerala, and the accused was arrested by the forest department officials.

George V.S. filed a bail application in the court, which was opposed by the prosecution.
