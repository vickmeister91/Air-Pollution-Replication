The recent court order pertains to a mining lease granted to M/s. Essel Mining & Industries Ltd. for the extraction of iron ore in Odisha. The lease was granted in 1955 and renewed twice, with the second renewal being for a period of 20 years over an area of 194.196 hectares. The lease included forest land, for which the petitioner obtained clearance from the Central Government in 2011. However, in 2015, the Central Government revoked the clearance for 173.039 hectares of forest land, which was challenged by the petitioner in court.

The court held that a substantive right had accrued in favor of the petitioner after the grant of approval in 2011, and the revocation of the same should have followed the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the revocation order did not provide any reasons for the decision. The court order states that the revocation of a forest clearance approval was done without any reason or opportunity for the affected party to be heard. The court holds that the principles of natural justice were not followed and the order is quashed. The court also notes that alternative remedies are not necessary in this case.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of providing reasons for decisions that affect the rights of individuals or entities. The court's ruling also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, particularly in cases where the environment and natural resources are involved.

The mining industry has been a contentious issue in India, with concerns raised about its impact on the environment and local communities. The court's decision in this case is a step towards ensuring that mining activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner, with due consideration given to the rights of all stakeholders.

The court's ruling also has implications for other industries that require forest clearance approvals, as it sets a precedent for the need to follow the principles of natural justice and provide reasons for decisions that affect the environment and natural resources.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for environmental protection and the rights of individuals and entities affected by decisions related to natural resources. It underscores the importance of transparency, accountability, and due process in decision-making processes, and sets a precedent for future cases involving forest clearance approvals and other environmental issues.
