The Rajasthan High Court recently received petitions from owners of stone crushers who were threatened with the closure of their businesses due to deficiencies found in their units. The court quashed the orders of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and remitted the matter to the Board for reconsideration. The Board had refused to grant consent to operate under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and directed the closure of the units under Section 31A of the Act. The court heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions and considered the right to appeal against orders and directions issued by the Board. The court also considered the principles of natural justice and the right to livelihood and life guaranteed by the Constitution of India.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the powers of the State Board to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court rejects the State Board's argument that the petitioners had a right to file an appeal against directions issued under Section 31A of the Act in the impugned order dated 04.02.2010. The court also discusses the violation of principles of natural justice and fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India by the Board. The court concludes that the writ petitions are maintainable and upholds the contentions raised by the petitioners.

The court order discusses the legal requirements for granting consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court finds that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond. The court concludes that the impugned orders passed by the Board are legally unsustainable and invalid.

The court order grants a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that has defaulted in complying with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher was lacking in pollution control measures during an inspection and that the Board did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the applications filed by the petitioners for renewal of the consent order within four months. The State Government is also directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

The court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the Rajasthan High Court has quashed the orders of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and remitted the matter to the Board for reconsideration. The court found that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond. The court also ordered the formation of a committee to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.
