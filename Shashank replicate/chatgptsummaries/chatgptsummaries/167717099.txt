The court order in question relates to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the quashing of FIR No. 05 dated 22nd January 2018. The FIR was registered for offences under Sections 452 and 295-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 9, 27, 39, 50, and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioners were named as accused in the FIR, and all subsequent proceedings were initiated against them. However, the parties involved in the case arrived at a compromise, and the petitioners sought to have the FIR and all subsequent proceedings quashed.

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court allowed the petition and quashed the FIR and all subsequent proceedings arising from it. The court's decision was based on the compromise reached between the parties, which was deemed to be in the interest of justice. The court held that the compromise was voluntary, and the parties had arrived at it without any coercion or undue influence. Therefore, the court found no reason to continue with the proceedings and quashed the FIR.

The offences mentioned in the FIR were serious in nature, and the accused could have faced severe punishment if found guilty. However, the court's decision to quash the FIR and all subsequent proceedings was based on the principle of compromise. The court recognized that the parties involved in the case had reached a settlement, and it was not in the interest of justice to continue with the proceedings. The court's decision was also in line with the Supreme Court's view that criminal cases should be quashed if the parties involved have arrived at a compromise, and it is in the interest of justice to do so.

In conclusion, the court's decision to quash the FIR and all subsequent proceedings arising from it was based on the principle of compromise. The court recognized that the parties involved in the case had reached a settlement, and it was not in the interest of justice to continue with the proceedings.
