In a recent court order, the petitioner, Daya Shankar, was accused of killing a protected animal named Bijju. However, the court observed that there was no evidence against the petitioner and that his involvement in the case was not prima facie established. As a result, the court granted interim protection to the petitioner during the investigation and ordered that he should not be arrested until credible and cogent evidence is collected against him or until the charge-sheet/police report is filed under Section 173 Cr.P.C., subject to his cooperation in the investigation.

The case at hand involves the killing of a protected animal, which is a serious offense under Indian law. The petitioner, Daya Shankar, was accused of committing this offense, but the court found that there was no evidence to support this claim. The court's decision to grant interim protection to the petitioner during the investigation is significant, as it ensures that he will not be arrested without sufficient evidence.

The court's order also highlights the importance of cooperation in investigations. The petitioner was granted protection subject to his cooperation in the investigation, which suggests that the court expects him to assist in the collection of evidence. This is a common requirement in criminal investigations, as it helps to ensure that all relevant evidence is collected and that the investigation is conducted fairly.

Overall, the court's order in this case is a reminder of the importance of evidence in criminal cases. Without sufficient evidence, it is difficult to establish guilt or innocence, and the court's decision to grant interim protection to the petitioner reflects this fact. Additionally, the court's emphasis on cooperation in investigations underscores the importance of working together to ensure that justice is served.
