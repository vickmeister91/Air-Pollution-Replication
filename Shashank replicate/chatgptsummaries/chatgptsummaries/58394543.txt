The Telangana High Court recently heard two writ petitions from M/s.Penna Cement Industries and The Special Chief Secretary to Government, Environment, Forests, Science and Technology, Hyderabad and others. The case involved the compliance of conditions stipulated in the in-principle approval granted by the Government of India for diversion of forest land for limestone quarrying. The petitioner had acquired land for compulsory afforestation (CA) but due to the submergence of some of the land, they were unable to comply with the conditions. 

The court considered the plea of the petitioner for providing reasonable time for handing over the balance CA land and emphasized the importance of sustainable development and protecting the environment. The court found that the premise on which the first letter was addressed by the respondent was erroneous and that the Government of India had not revoked the in-principle approval. The court order states that industrialists must provide land for afforestation when natural resources are exploited. 

The petitioner was unable to comply with this condition due to circumstances beyond their control, such as the submergence of land and the division of the state. The petitioner has offered to provide land in a different location and acquire the necessary balance within a year. The court has allowed the writ petitions and set aside previous proceedings, with pending petitions being disposed of as infructuous.
