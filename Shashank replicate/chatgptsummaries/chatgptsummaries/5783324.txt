The Bombay High Court issued an order on November 10, 2014, in a public interest litigation case involving Dattatraya Hari Mane and others against the State of Maharashtra and others. The case concerns pollution caused to River Panchaganga due to the release of untreated sewage water from Kolhapur and Ichalkaranji cities into the river and various other factors. The petitioners raised concerns regarding the pollution of the river due to various factors, including inadequate domestic waste water treatment facilities in the cities and other areas.

The court cited Article 48A of the Constitution of India, which lays down that the State shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment, and Article 51A, which provides for the fundamental duties of citizens to protect and improve the natural environment. The public law doctrine is applicable to India. The court emphasized that the State is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment, and has a legal duty to protect them. These resources cannot be converted into private ownership or used for commercial purposes unless it is necessary for the public good and in the public interest.

The court recognized the importance of protecting the environment and ecology, which has been a sacred duty in Indian society since ancient times. The Constitution of India recognizes the importance of protecting and improving the environment, and imposes a duty on the State to do so. The court discussed the duty imposed on the State to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife, as well as the corresponding duty of citizens to protect and improve the natural environment. The court also recognized the importance of the public trust doctrine in protecting natural resources held by the government as trustee of the people.

The court specifically addressed allegations of untreated sewage water being discharged into the Panchaganga River from various sources, including cities and power looms, and called for the Respondents to take steps to prevent pollution and comply with environmental laws. The court directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to take action to prevent pollution of the Panchaganga river and implement the Water Act. NEERI was appointed to make a report on the pollution and suggest remedial measures. The costs and fees of NEERI will be paid equally by the fourth and fifth respondents. NEERI will have access to any industries that may be required to be inspected for the purpose of implementing the project. Respondent No. 4 claims to have complied with the order dated 6th December 2013.

The court order stated that a pumping station at Jayanti Nala was commissioned by Respondent No. 4 in compliance with a 2013 order. The petitioner can file complaints with the MPCB regarding effluent discharge by certain sugar factories. All authorities, including the MPCB, are bound to take action in accordance with the law. The court also discussed the pollution caused by various sources, including cities, citizens, industries, villages, and industrial estates. Before issuing interim directions, the court referred to the stand taken by the MPCB, which includes an action plan to prevent pollution of the Panchaganga River and directions issued to the fourth Respondent Corporation under the Water Act.

The court issued directions to the Municipal Corporation to submit proposals for the installation of integrated STPs, prepare proposals for domestic effluent collection and treatment, and divert Nallas to avoid discharge of untreated sewage into the river. The Corporation did not comply with these directions, and further directions were issued in 2011 and 2012. The affidavit also mentioned non-compliance by the fifth Respondent Municipal Council and action taken against defaulting industries. The affidavit stated that the Corporation is generating 96 MLD of sewage, but only 43.5 MLD is being given primary treatment.

The court order stated that only 43.5 MLD of sewage is being given primary treatment, and the rest is discharged into the Panchaganga River without treatment. The treatment given to the 43.5 MLD is also inadequate. The Ichalkaranji Municipal Council generates 40 MLD effluent, but the STP set up can only deal with 20 MLD sewage every day and is not maintained properly. Thus, 28 MLD of sewage is being discharged without any treatment in the Panchaganga River. The court has issued directions to complete and commission new STPs and to lift sewage by making appropriate lifting arrangements to prevent its discharge into the river. The KMC has been directed to complete and commission 76 MLD new Kasba Bawda STP's work within the time stipulated in the directions. The IMC has been directed to operate and maintain existing STP of 20 MLD round the clock and provide 12+12 MLD STP as agreed by it on or before March 2014.

The court order required the proper regulation of sewage discharge into the Panchganga river to prevent pollution. The order also directed the regulation of Kala Odha discharge into the river and asked for bank guarantees to ensure compliance. Affidavits from various officials and organizations were submitted, outlining steps taken to minimize pollution and proposing long-term measures for rejuvenation of the river. The court noted that multiple agencies will need to be involved in the process of preventing pollution and improving water quality.

The court order referred to a case where the city of Kolhapur was facing a serious problem of polluted drinking water due to untreated sewage and sullage being discharged into the river Panchganga. The
