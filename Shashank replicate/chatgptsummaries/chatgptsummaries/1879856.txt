The Jammu and Kashmir High Court recently received a complaint from environmentalist Maneka Gandhi about the damage caused by unregulated charcoal bhatties in Kathua district. The court treated it as a public interest litigation and required responses from concerned officials. Upon investigation, it was found that the bhatties were causing damage to the forests and environment, and there were no regulations in place to control them.

In response to this, the court issued several directions to address the issue. Firstly, it issued a notice to owners/operators of charcoal bhatties to remove them three kilometers away from the demarcated forest boundary within two weeks. This was done to prevent further damage to the environment and forests. The court also directed the Deputy Commissioner to enforce the directions received from the Chairman Pollution Board and to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the court's orders.

Additionally, the court directed the expedited consideration and promulgation of a statutory regulation to regulate the operation of these bhatties. This was done to ensure that such activities are carried out in a regulated and controlled manner, with minimal damage to the environment. The court recognized the importance of regulating such activities to ensure sustainable development and the protection of the environment.

The court's decision was a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The unregulated operation of charcoal bhatties was causing significant damage to the environment and forests, and the lack of regulations was exacerbating the problem. The court's directions to remove the bhatties from the demarcated forest boundary and to regulate their operation were necessary steps towards addressing this issue.

The court's decision was also significant in that it recognized the importance of public interest litigation in addressing environmental issues. The court treated Maneka Gandhi's complaint as a public interest litigation, which allowed for a more comprehensive investigation and response to the issue. This approach is essential in addressing environmental issues, as they often require a collective effort and response.

Overall, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court's decision to regulate the operation of charcoal bhatties in Kathua district was a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The court's directions to remove the bhatties from the demarcated forest boundary and to regulate their operation were necessary steps towards addressing the damage caused by unregulated activities. The court's recognition of the importance of public interest litigation in addressing environmental issues was also significant, as it allowed for a more comprehensive investigation and response to the issue.
