Hindalco Industries Ltd. had filed a writ petition challenging two orders contained in Letter No. 1494 dated 21st November 2003 and Letter dated 17th January 2004. The Divisional Forest Officer, South Forest Division, Daltonganj, Medninagar, Palamau had directed the writ petitioner-Company not to carry on mining operations without prior approval of the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and also not to use and undertake the repair work of the road known as 'Hami-Orsa Road'. However, the writ petition filed by the appellant-Company M/s. Hindalco Industries Limited was dismissed.

Hindalco Industries Ltd. appealed against the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge in Writ Petition (C) No. 1032 of 2004. The appeal was disposed of with a direction upon the State Government to allow the appellant-Company to start mining activities after obtaining clearance under the 1994 Notification in respect of the areas to which no objection has been raised in the subsisting lease.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act requires prior approval of the Central Government for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act also provides for the constitution of a National Board for Wildlife and State Boards for Wildlife to promote the conservation and development of wildlife and forests.

In this case, the Divisional Forest Officer had directed Hindalco Industries Ltd. not to carry on mining operations without prior approval of the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The Divisional Forest Officer had also directed Hindalco Industries Ltd. not to use and undertake the repair work of the road known as 'Hami-Orsa Road'. The writ petition filed by Hindalco Industries Ltd. challenging these orders was dismissed.

However, on appeal, the court directed the State Government to allow Hindalco Industries Ltd. to start mining activities after obtaining clearance under the 1994 Notification in respect of the areas to which no objection has been raised in the subsisting lease. The 1994 Notification provides for the procedure for grant of forest clearance for mining projects. The Notification requires the mining leaseholder to submit a mining plan and a scheme for afforestation and regeneration of the area to be mined. The Notification also requires the mining leaseholder to obtain the consent of the Gram Sabha and the concerned State Government departments.

The court's direction to allow Hindalco Industries Ltd. to start mining activities after obtaining clearance under the 1994 Notification in respect of the areas to which no objection has been raised in the subsisting lease is in line with the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the 1994 Notification. The Act and the Notification aim to balance the need for development with the need for conservation of forests and wildlife. The Act and the Notification provide for a procedure for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, which includes obtaining prior approval of the Central Government and obtaining the consent of the Gram Sabha and the concerned State Government departments.

In conclusion, the court's direction in this case is a reminder of the importance of following the procedure laid down in the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the 1994 Notification for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act and the Notification aim to balance the need for development with the need for conservation of forests and wildlife. The court's direction to allow Hindalco Industries Ltd. to start mining activities after obtaining clearance under the 1994 Notification in respect of the areas to which no objection has been raised in the subsisting lease is in line with this aim.
