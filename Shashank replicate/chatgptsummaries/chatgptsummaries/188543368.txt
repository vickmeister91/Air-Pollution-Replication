The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint from Mr. Lalit Gulati against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. regarding the allotment of a residential plot in the project of the Opposite Parties, namely 'IREO HAMLET' in Sector 98, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The complainant alleged that the Opposite Parties arbitrarily changed the location of the originally allotted plot and that there was no development at the site. The Opposite Parties denied the allegations and stated that they had completed the development works at the site.

After reviewing the evidence, the Commission ordered the Opposite Parties to refund Rs.35,47,434/- along with interest and pay Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation on account of mental agony and Rs.50,000/- as litigation expenses. The court found that the possession of the plot was offered without complete development and basic amenities at the site, and therefore, the complainant is entitled to a refund. The court also ordered the payment of interest on the deposited amount at a rate of 13% per annum. The complainant is also entitled to compensation for mental agony and physical harassment caused by the paper possession offered.

In another case, a plot buyer filed a complaint against a real estate company. The buyer was allotted a plot in a residential project, but the company changed the plot without informing the buyer. The buyer refused to accept the change and expressed dissatisfaction with the company's decision. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the company had followed all necessary procedures and had not engaged in any unfair trade practices. The court also noted that the buyer had paid a significant amount towards the plot.

The court order states that an amount of Rs.23,72,780.00 is still due and payable towards the sale consideration of a plot. The complainant had accepted the relocation of the plot and made a payment of Rs.7,39,968/- after relocation. The complainant had also been in default in remitting various installments. The court also discusses the jurisdiction of the Consumer Foras to entertain consumer complaints in the face of an arbitration clause in the agreement. The court concludes that the Consumer Foras have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the consumers.

The court order states that the existence of an arbitration clause in an agreement does not bar a consumer from filing a complaint in relation to a deficiency of service. The protection provided to consumers under the Consumer Protection Act is in addition to remedies available under any other statute, including consentient arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The complainant in this case falls within the definition of a consumer, and the objection raised by the opposite party is rejected. The court also has territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide the complaint, and a clause of jurisdiction by way of an agreement between the parties cannot be made applicable to consumer complaints filed before consumer fora. The complainant seeks a refund of the amount paid along with interest.

In another case, the complainant's request for a refund of the amount paid for a plot of land, along with interest, has been accepted. The court found that the possession of the plot was offered without complete development and basic amenities at the site, and therefore, the complainant is entitled to a refund. The court also ordered the payment of interest on the deposited amount at a rate of 13% per annum. The complainant is also entitled to compensation for mental agony and physical harassment caused by the paper possession offered.

In the last case, the complainant is not entitled to the full compensation of Rs.10 Lacs claimed due to default in remitting various installments. The court orders Opposite Party No.1 to refund the complainant Rs.35,47,434/- with interest and pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service, and unfair trade practices. The complaint against Opposite Party No.2 is dismissed. The court also mentions that any financial institution that the complainant has availed a loan from shall have the first charge on the amount payable.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of fair trade practices and the protection of consumer rights. The courts have consistently ruled in favor of consumers who have been subjected to unfair practices by real estate companies. The orders also emphasize the need for companies to provide complete development and basic amenities at the site before offering possession to buyers. The jurisdiction of Consumer Foras to entertain consumer complaints in the face of an arbitration clause in the agreement has also been established. Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder to companies to act in the best interest of their consumers and to uphold ethical business practices.
