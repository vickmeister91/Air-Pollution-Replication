The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Tejram, who has been in custody since 18 June 2017 for allegedly killing a bird in a reserved forest area with an unauthorized firearm. The court notes that the investigation is complete and the charge-sheet has been filed, and that the applicant has no criminal antecedents. The court allows the bail application and directs that Tejram be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The case of Tejram is an interesting one, as it highlights the importance of following the law when it comes to wildlife conservation. The killing of a bird in a reserved forest area with an unauthorized firearm is a serious offense, and it is commendable that the court has taken this matter seriously.

The fact that the investigation is complete and the charge-sheet has been filed is an important consideration in the court's decision to grant bail. This indicates that the prosecution has completed its case against Tejram, and that there is no reason to believe that he will abscond or interfere with the investigation.

Another important factor in the court's decision is the fact that Tejram has no criminal antecedents. This suggests that he is not a flight risk or a danger to society, and that he is unlikely to commit any further offenses while out on bail.

The court's decision to grant bail is therefore a reasonable one, and it is in line with the principles of justice and fairness. However, it is important to note that Tejram will be required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This is a significant amount of money, and it is intended to ensure that Tejram appears in court when required and does not abscond.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Tejram is a reasonable one, given the circumstances of the case. It is important to remember that wildlife conservation is a serious matter, and that those who violate the law in this regard will be held accountable. At the same time, it is important to ensure that justice is done in a fair and impartial manner, and that the rights of the accused are protected. The court's decision in this case is a testament to the strength of our legal system, and to the importance of upholding the rule of law.
