The court order pertains to a case where Md. Tarique Hussain, the proprietor of M/s Global Print Associates, was summoned to face trial for an offence punishable under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint petition against him for operating a printing press without obtaining prior consent (N.O.C.) from the complainant, which was required by law. The petitioner argued that N.O.C. was not required for the establishment of a printing press, and that the prosecution had become infructuous as N.O.C. had already been granted. However, the court did not interfere with the prosecution, as the offence had already been committed much before the grant of N.O.C.

The court order states that if an offender fails to comply with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act for more than a year after conviction, they will face imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of seven years, along with a fine. Section 37 of the Act applies to violations of Sections 21, 22, and 31-A. Section 21 deals with restrictions on establishing or operating industrial plants in air pollution control areas without the prior consent of the State Board. The application for consent must be made in the prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fees. The State Board may make inquiries and grant or refuse consent within four months of receiving the application. The Board may also cancel or refuse further consent if the conditions are not fulfilled, but the offender must be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

The court order outlines conditions for industries to comply with in order to control air pollution. These conditions include installing and operating control equipment approved by the State Board, keeping the equipment in good condition, and erecting chimneys as necessary. If the State Board determines that conditions need to be varied, the person responsible for the industry must comply with the new conditions after being given an opportunity to be heard. If the industry is transferred to a new owner, the new owner is bound to comply with the same conditions. Section 22 restricts the emission of air pollutants beyond the standards set by the State Board.

The court order discusses various sections of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and concludes that the complaint made by a school regarding noise pollution did not justify the application of Section 37 of the Act. The court found the complaint to be suffering from serious deformity and set aside the order of the lower court.
