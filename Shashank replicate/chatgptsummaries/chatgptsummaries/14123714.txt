The Telangana High Court recently heard a case involving a society engaged in sand mining and transportation. The State Government had entrusted the work of sand mining to the Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation (TSMDC), which then entered into an agreement with the petitioner. However, a joint inspection found that sand had been extracted from an area outside the specified sand bearing area, which could attract a penalty. The TSMDC was allowed to sell the sand already excavated, and the petitioner was entitled to compensation for the excavation. The State Government later imposed a penalty on the petitioner, which was challenged in this writ petition.

The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the petitioner had undertaken the activity under the supervision and control of TSMDC. The court referred to Rule 5 of the Rules notified vide G.O.Ms.No.3 dated 8.1.2015, which outlined the responsibilities of TSMDC in sand mining. The court ultimately did not find the penalty justified and ordered the release of the balance of compensation owed to the petitioner.

The court order outlines rules and conditions for extracting and dispatching sand from allotted areas, including obtaining necessary licenses and permits, maintaining production and dispatch records, and penalties for violations. The court found that the government's imposition of a penalty on the petitioner was without jurisdiction and cannot be sustained in the eye of the law. The writ petition was allowed, and the respondents were directed to pay the entire amount to the petitioner without any deductions.

The case highlights the importance of following rules and regulations in sand mining and transportation. The State Government had entrusted the work of sand mining to TSMDC, which had entered into an agreement with the petitioner. However, a joint inspection found that sand had been extracted from an area outside the specified sand bearing area, which could attract a penalty. The court referred to Rule 5 of the Rules notified vide G.O.Ms.No.3 dated 8.1.2015, which outlined the responsibilities of TSMDC in sand mining. The court noted that the petitioner had undertaken the activity under the supervision and control of TSMDC, and therefore, the penalty imposed by the State Government was not justified.

The court order also emphasizes the need for obtaining necessary licenses and permits, maintaining production and dispatch records, and penalties for violations. These rules and conditions are crucial in ensuring that sand mining and transportation are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner. Violations of these rules can attract penalties, as seen in this case.

The court's decision to release the balance of compensation owed to the petitioner without any deductions is a significant relief for the petitioner. It also sends a message to other parties involved in sand mining and transportation that violations of rules and regulations will not be tolerated.

In conclusion, the Telangana High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following rules and regulations in sand mining and transportation.
