The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over the pricing of land for industrial plots under a relocation scheme in Delhi. In the first case, industrial units in non-conforming areas/residential areas were shut down and directed to be relocated to industrial areas by the Supreme Court. The petitioners had applied for industrial plots at the Narela Industrial Complex developed by DSIDC, and were issued notices/allotment letters indicating a hiked up land price of Rs. 7,776/- per sq. metre, which they found arbitrary and without any reasonable basis. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous judgments on similar matters, ultimately stating that the pricing of land in such cases is a policy matter and the courts have limited scope of interference.

In the second case, the petitioners argued that the respondent cannot charge a 20% unearned increase annually over and above the pre-determined rates. The court found that the brochure and relocation scheme do not mention any charge under the heading "Unearned Increase" and that the price hike from Rs. 5,400/- per sq. metre to Rs. 7,776/- per sq. metre was not on account of any of the factors mentioned in the guidelines. The court concluded that the respondents must justify the enhancement of prices and that the writ petitions are maintainable.

In the third case, the respondents had demanded Rs. 7,776/- per sq. metre, which the court found unjustified. However, the court also noted that the price of Rs. 5,400/- per sq. metre fixed in 2001 would need to be adjusted for inflation to arrive at a fair price in 2007. The court directed the respondents to use the wholesale price index to compute the adjusted price and indicated that possession of the land would be handed over once the petitioners made the payment. The writ petitions were allowed, and the parties were to bear their own costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of transparency and justification in the pricing of land for industrial plots under relocation schemes. The courts have limited scope of interference in such matters, but they can intervene if the pricing is found to be arbitrary or unjustified. Inflation must also be taken into account when determining fair prices for land.
