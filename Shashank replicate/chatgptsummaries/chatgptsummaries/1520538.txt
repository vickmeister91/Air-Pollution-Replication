The Ganges river is one of the most important rivers in India, and it is also one of the most polluted. The Bihar State Water Pollution Control and Prevention Board has been working to address this issue, and recently filed a complaint against Bata India Shoe Company for polluting the river by discharging effluents without proper treatment. The court order in this case provides important insights into the legal framework for addressing water pollution in India.

The first court order in this case rejected several arguments made by Bata India Shoe Company. The company had argued that the complaint was premature, and that the prosecution against the company's manager was bad in law. However, the court found that the complaint was valid and that the Board had complied with the provisions of Section 49 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1973, which requires a mandate of sanction before prosecution can proceed. The court ordered the case to be transferred to the file of a Judicial Magistrate for disposal.

The second court order in this case addressed a different argument made by Bata India Shoe Company. The company had argued that the State Board had no jurisdiction to prosecute them for pollution of an inter-state stream. However, the court found that the State Board did have jurisdiction and that the company had a legal duty to comply with regulations. The court dismissed the company's argument and the application.

Taken together, these court orders provide important guidance on the legal framework for addressing water pollution in India. They make it clear that the State Board has the authority to prosecute companies for polluting inter-state streams, and that companies have a legal duty to comply with regulations. They also emphasize the importance of complying with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1973, including the requirement for a mandate of sanction before prosecution can proceed.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the commitment of the Bihar State Water Pollution Control and Prevention Board to addressing water pollution in the Ganges river, and the importance of enforcing environmental regulations to protect this vital resource. They also highlight the need for companies to take responsibility for their environmental impact and to comply with regulations to prevent further pollution of the Ganges and other waterways in India.
