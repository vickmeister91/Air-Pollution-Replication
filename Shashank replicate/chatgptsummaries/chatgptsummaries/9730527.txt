The first court order pertains to a petition filed by Ramgopal and another person challenging an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge in Criminal Revision No. 172/2014. The order had directed the removal of an illegal construction on a public way used by the general public. The applicants had not challenged the order dated 15/09/2014, which had attained finality. The court found that the applicants had not raised any objection denying the existence of a public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place. The court rejected the petition.

The case in question involved an illegal construction on a public way that was used by the general public. The Additional Sessions Judge had ordered the removal of the construction, and the applicants had filed a petition challenging this order. However, the court found that the applicants had not challenged a previous order that had already attained finality. Additionally, the court noted that the applicants had not raised any objection to the existence of a public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place. As a result, the court rejected the petition.

The second court order refers to a case where the applicants have failed to make a prima facie case for any further direction to the Court of SDM, Tahsil-Amba, District-Morena to follow up the procedure as laid down under Section 133 to Section 143 of CrPC. The court has dismissed the application as the facts of the case are distinguishable from the judgment relied upon by the counsel for the applicants.

In this case, the applicants had filed an application seeking further direction to the Court of SDM, Tahsil-Amba, District-Morena to follow the procedure laid down under Section 133 to Section 143 of CrPC. However, the court found that the applicants had failed to make a prima facie case for such direction. Additionally, the court noted that the facts of the case were distinguishable from the judgment relied upon by the counsel for the applicants. As a result, the court dismissed the application.

In both of these court orders, the courts have made decisions based on the facts of the cases presented to them. In the first case, the court rejected the petition because the applicants had not challenged a previous order that had already attained finality, and had not raised any objection to the existence of a public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place. In the second case, the court dismissed the application because the applicants had failed to make a prima facie case for further direction, and the facts of the case were distinguishable from the judgment relied upon by the counsel for the applicants.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of presenting a strong case with relevant facts and evidence. Without a strong case, it is unlikely that a court will rule in favor of the applicant. Additionally, it is important to challenge orders in a timely manner and to raise any objections to the existence of public rights or other relevant issues. By doing so, applicants can increase their chances of success in court.
