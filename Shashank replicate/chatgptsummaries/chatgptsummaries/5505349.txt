The court recently rejected the bail application of Tarapad Mandal, who was accused of mixing poison in earthen jars used to collect date juice, resulting in the death of two adult bears. The defense argued that Mandal was innocent and falsely implicated, and that there was no evidence of poison being seized from him. However, the court considered the seriousness of the offense and its impact on society and rejected the bail application.

The case against Mandal was based on the allegation that he had mixed poison in earthen jars used to collect date juice, which resulted in the death of two adult bears. The incident had taken place in a forest area, and the bears had died after consuming the poisoned juice. The forest department had registered a case against Mandal under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, and he was arrested and sent to judicial custody.

Mandal had filed a bail application in the court, which was opposed by the forest department. The prosecution argued that Mandal was a habitual offender and had been involved in similar offenses in the past. They also stated that the offense was serious in nature and had a significant impact on society, as it involved the killing of protected wildlife.

The defense, on the other hand, argued that Mandal was innocent and falsely implicated in the case. They stated that there was no evidence of poison being seized from him, and that the case against him was based on circumstantial evidence. They also argued that Mandal was a poor farmer and had no motive to kill the bears.

After hearing both sides, the court rejected Mandal's bail application. The court considered the seriousness of the offense and its impact on society, and observed that the offense was not only against the bears but also against the environment and the ecosystem. The court also noted that the offense was committed in a forest area, which is a protected area, and that the accused had shown no remorse for his actions.

The court's decision to reject Mandal's bail application is significant as it sends a strong message to those who engage in such activities. The Wildlife Protection Act provides for stringent punishment for offenses related to the killing of protected wildlife, and the court's decision reinforces the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Tarapad Mandal's bail application in the case related to the death of two adult bears is a significant step towards protecting wildlife and the environment. The court's observation that the offense was not only against the bears but also against the environment and the ecosystem highlights the need for greater awareness and action towards protecting our natural resources. The Wildlife Protection Act provides for stringent punishment for offenses related to the killing of protected wildlife, and the court's decision reinforces the importance of upholding the law and protecting our wildlife.
