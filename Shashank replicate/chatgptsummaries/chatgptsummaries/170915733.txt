The court has issued several orders in various cases related to the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986, and the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971. In one case, Abdul Kassim and others filed a writ petition seeking to quash certain communications and a Gazette notification issued by the Divisional Forest Officer, Palakkad, under the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986. The petitioners had purchased land for agricultural activities, which originally belonged to Bharathy and her children and had become vested with the government. The Forest Tribunal had allowed their applications to release the properties from the forest, and the petitioners had purchased the land after taking into account the terrain appropriate for plantation purposes. The court allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned communications and notification.

In another case, the court heard arguments from both sides regarding a dispute over the removal of rocks from a property for rubber plantation. The petitioners had obtained a certificate of restoration from the previous owners, but the Forest Range Officer issued a notice to stop quarrying activity. The petitioners filed a writ petition challenging the notice and subsequent orders, including a Gazette notification prohibiting the cutting of trees on the property. The court will need to make a determination based on the evidence presented.

In yet another case, the court ruled that the land in question is not a private forest and therefore not liable to be vested in the government. The Kerala Preservation of Trees Act would not apply to the land in question. The court cites previous judgments to support its decision, including one that states the Preservation of Trees Act overrides any provisions in the Kerala Private Forests Act. The court also notes that the purpose of the Preservation of Trees Act is to prevent indiscriminate felling and destruction of trees in the state.

In another case, the court discussed the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, which was enacted to prevent the indiscriminate felling and destruction of trees in the state. The act has a non-obstante clause that overrides any other law or court order. The court also discussed the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971, and how the Preservation of Trees Act overrides it. The court also mentioned a previous judgment that allows for lawful cultivation on private forest land, but only within certain limits and subject to conditions. The court evaluated the conditions imposed on the restoration certificate issued by the Forest Department and found that the disputed areas do not exceed the ceiling limit and are only exempted under Sec.3(2) of the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971, but are not excluded from the forest area. The petitioners are allowed to carry out agricultural operations subject to the conditions incorporated in the restoration certificate.

In another case, the court ruled that the petitioners are allowed to carry out agricultural operations but must follow the conditions outlined in the Ext.P6 certificate. The court also upheld the validity of the Ext.P12 notification issued by the State Government under Sec.5 of the Preservation of Trees Act, 1986, which prohibits cutting of trees in notified areas. The petitioners' argument that the Act does not apply to their property is dismissed, and the court rules that the petitioners are not entitled to relief against the Ext.P12 Gazette notification. The writ petition is dismissed.

In yet another case, the court included exhibits of petitions, orders, and judgments related to a case where the petitioners were sued by the forest range officer in Ottapalam. The exhibits include copies of the petition, orders issued by the third respondent, a judgment issued by the court, and a notification published in the Kerala Gazette. The respondent's exhibit includes a copy of a government order related to the case.

Overall, the court has issued several orders related to the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986, and the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971. The court has evaluated various arguments and evidence presented by both sides and made determinations based on the facts of each case. The court has upheld the purpose of the Preservation of Trees Act, which is to prevent indiscriminate felling and destruction of trees in the state, and has ruled that the Act overrides any other law or court order. The court has also evaluated the conditions imposed on restoration certificates and has allowed for lawful cultivation on private forest land within certain limits and subject to conditions.
