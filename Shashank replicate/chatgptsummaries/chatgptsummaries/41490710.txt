The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Sanjay Maheshwari against the Forest Department and others. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the Assistant Conservator of Forest, Forest Circle, Kota, which held that the petitioner could not carry out non-forest activities in an area that was a forest falling in Ladpura, Kota. The petitioner argued that the order was passed by a Ranger Gr-I who was officiating as the Assistant Conservator of Forest and was not authorized to exercise power under Section 91 of the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956.

The court, however, dismissed the writ petition, stating that the land in question falls in the forest area, and the required diversion from the Central Government with reference to Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, has not been obtained. The court directed that in the event the petitioner makes an application for diversion under Section 2 of the Act of 1980, the same shall be processed by the competent authority of the State Government within a period of three months of its filing and forwarded, if warranted in the facts of the case, to the Central Government.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a central legislation that regulates diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes must be approved by the Central Government. The Act also provides for the constitution of a National Board for Wildlife and State Boards for Wildlife to advise the Central and State Governments on matters relating to wildlife conservation.

The Act defines forest land as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and any land that is notified as forest by the Central Government or the State Government. The Act also includes any land that is deemed to be forest under any law for the time being in force.

In the present case, the court held that the land in question falls within the definition of forest land under the Act. The court also noted that the required diversion from the Central Government has not been obtained. Therefore, the petitioner cannot carry out non-forest activities in the area without obtaining the necessary approvals under the Act.

The court also directed that in the event the petitioner makes an application for diversion under Section 2 of the Act of 1980, the same shall be processed by the competent authority of the State Government within a period of three months of its filing and forwarded, if warranted in the facts of the case, to the Central Government. This direction is in line with the provisions of the Act, which require that any application for diversion of forest land must be processed within a specified time frame.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary approvals under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, before carrying out any non-forest activities in forest land. The Act is a crucial legislation for the protection and conservation of forests and wildlife in the country. It is important that the provisions of the Act are strictly adhered to in order to ensure the sustainable use of forest resources and the protection of wildlife habitats.
