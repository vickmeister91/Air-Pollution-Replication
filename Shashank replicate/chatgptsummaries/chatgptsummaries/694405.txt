The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioners were found guilty, convicted and sentenced under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioners appealed the sentence and the learned Sessions Judge admitted the appeal and suspended the sentence subject to conditions, including a deposit of Rs.10,000 towards the fine amount. The petitioners complained about the imposition of this condition, stating that they were too poor to pay the amount.

The court allowed the petition in part, directing the petitioners to deposit Rs.5,000 and granting them time till 31/05/2007 to pay the balance amount of Rs.5,000. If they were unable to raise the balance amount, they could make an application to the learned Sessions Judge for expeditious disposal of the appeal, which must be disposed of on or before 24/5/2007.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. It was enacted in 1972 and has been amended several times since then. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas, as well as for the regulation of hunting, trapping, and trade in wild animals and plants.

The case in question involved the violation of the provisions of the Act by the petitioners. They were found guilty and convicted by the trial court, and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.10,000 each. They appealed the sentence to the Sessions Court, which admitted the appeal and suspended the sentence subject to conditions, including the deposit of Rs.10,000 towards the fine amount.

The petitioners complained about the imposition of this condition, stating that they were too poor to pay the amount. The court considered their plea and allowed the petition in part, directing the petitioners to deposit Rs.5,000 and granting them time till 31/05/2007 to pay the balance amount of Rs.5,000.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should not be deprived of his or her rights without a fair hearing. The court recognized that the petitioners were too poor to pay the entire amount of the fine, and therefore directed them to deposit only half the amount and granted them time to pay the balance.

The court also recognized that the petitioners had a right to a speedy trial and disposal of their appeal. Therefore, it directed them to make an application to the learned Sessions Judge for expeditious disposal of the appeal, which must be disposed of on or before 24/5/2007.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioners were found guilty, convicted and sentenced under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the petition in part, directing the petitioners to deposit Rs.5,000 and granting them time till 31/05/2007 to pay the balance amount of Rs.5,000. If they were unable to raise the balance amount, they could make an application to the learned Sessions Judge for expeditious disposal of the appeal, which must be disposed of on or before 24/5/2007. The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice and recognized the petitioners' right to a fair hearing and a speedy trial.
