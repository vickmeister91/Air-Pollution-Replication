In a recent court case, Jang Bhadur Singh filed a miscellaneous petition against Mahipal Singh, alleging that the court had made an error in rejecting his application under Section 91 of Cr. P.C. for summoning an alleged document related to a loan. The petitioner claimed that a stamp was executed at the time of giving the loan, but was not produced before the court. However, the court found that neither the complaint nor the statement of the complainant mentioned the execution of a stamp, and therefore, there was no justification for entertaining the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the miscellaneous petition and the stay application.

The case involved a dispute over a loan, and the petitioner claimed that a stamp was executed at the time of giving the loan, but was not produced before the court. The court found that there was no mention of the execution of a stamp in either the complaint or the statement of the complainant, and therefore, there was no justification for entertaining the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the miscellaneous petition and the stay application.

Section 91 of Cr. P.C. deals with the power of the court to summon documents or other things. It states that the court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, summon any person as a witness or order any person to produce any document or other thing. However, the court may only do so if it considers that the production of such document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In this case, the court found that there was no justification for entertaining the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. because there was no mention of the execution of a stamp in either the complaint or the statement of the complainant. The court therefore dismissed the miscellaneous petition and the stay application.

This case highlights the importance of providing accurate and complete information in legal proceedings. If the petitioner had mentioned the execution of a stamp in the complaint or the statement of the complainant, the court may have considered the production of the document necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding. However, because there was no mention of the stamp, the court found that there was no justification for entertaining the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the miscellaneous petition and the stay application filed by Jang Bhadur Singh against Mahipal Singh. The court found that there was no justification for entertaining the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. because there was no mention of the execution of a stamp in either the complaint or the statement of the complainant. This case highlights the importance of providing accurate and complete information in legal proceedings, as it can have a significant impact on the outcome of the case.
