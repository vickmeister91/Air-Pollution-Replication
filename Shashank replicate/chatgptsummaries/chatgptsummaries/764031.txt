The Supreme Court of India recently granted leave in all special leave petitions filed by the A.P. Pollution Control Board against the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in four writ petitions. The case involves the establishment of an industry for the production of B.S.S. Castor oil derivatives, which the Pollution Control Board claims would lead to pollution. The company had to obtain NOC from the Pollution Control Board, which was rejected due to the proposed site falling within 10 km of two lakes. The government granted exemption from the 10 km rule, but the Pollution Control Board rejected the application for consent.

The court order discusses a case where a company's application for consent to establish a polluting industry was rejected by the Pollution Control Board. The company appealed the decision and provided evidence of using eco-friendly technology with safeguards against pollution. The appellate authority allowed the appeal and directed the Pollution Control Board to grant consent subject to conditions. Public interest cases were filed against the decision, but the High Court dismissed them and allowed the company's writ petition. The court order raises various issues regarding the validity of orders and breach of provisions related to pollution control. The court focuses on the technological aspects of the case.

The court order discusses the difficulties faced by courts in dealing with complex technological and scientific issues related to pollution and environmental law. The order suggests the need for a specialized court or tribunal with a wider discretion to determine its procedure and bring specialist experience to bear on environmental issues. The uncertain nature of scientific opinions and the inadequacies of science in identifying adverse effects of hazards are also discussed. The order refers to the Precautionary Principle and the new concept of burden of proof in environmental matters.

The court order discusses the principles of sustainable development, including the Precautionary Principle, the Polluter-Pays Principle, and the Onus of Proof. These principles are now part of Indian law, as outlined in the Constitution and various environmental statutes. The Precautionary Principle involves anticipating environmental harm and taking measures to avoid it, while the Polluter-Pays Principle places the burden of proof on those proposing actions that may harm the environment. The court emphasizes the importance of properly applying these principles in environmental cases.

The court order discusses the need for adequate judicial and scientific inputs in environmental appellate authorities/tribunals in order to ensure good governance and prevent harm to the environment and human health. The court suggests that current statutes and rules fall short in providing a combination of judicial and scientific needs, and proposes the establishment of environmental courts with a combination of judges and technical experts. The court also recommends amending existing notifications and rules to include judges and scientists of high ranking and experience. The court emphasizes the importance of proper and fair adjudication of disputes relating to the environment and pollution.

The court order urges the Central and State Governments to take appropriate action urgently based on the recommendations provided. The order discusses the National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997, which consists of a sitting or retired Supreme Court Judge or a Chief Justice of a High Court, a Vice-Chairman with expertise in technical aspects of environmental problems, and Technical Members with professional knowledge or practical experience in conservation, environmental management, land or planning, and development. The court emphasizes the duty of the present generation towards posterity and the principle of inter-generational equity. The court also discusses the need for an alternative procedure to provide adequate solutions to meet the requirements of public interest, environmental protection, elimination of pollution, and sustained development. The court suggests that in complex cases involving environmental matters, it can refer scientific and technical aspects for investigation and opinion to expert bodies such as the Appellate Authority under the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997.

The court has determined that the respondent industry is not a danger to the environment or ecology, but has referred certain technical and scientific aspects to an expert body for investigation and opinion. The expert body will examine issues related to the industry's pollution potentiality and its impact on sensitive catchment areas. The authority will have the power to inspect the factory, call for documents, examine witnesses, and obtain technical advice. The authority will also give an opportunity to the parties to file objections and lead evidence. The court has requested that the authority give its opinion within three months and has directed copies of the judgment to be communicated to various government bodies and authorities dealing with environment, pollution, ecology, and wildlife.

In summary, the court order discusses a case involving the establishment of an industry for the production of B.S.S. Castor oil derivatives, which the Pollution Control Board claims would lead to pollution. The court raises various issues regarding the validity of orders and breach of provisions related to pollution control. The court emphasizes the need for a specialized court or tribunal with a wider discretion to determine its procedure and bring specialist experience to bear on environmental issues. The court also discusses the principles of sustainable development, including the Precautionary Principle, the Polluter-Pays Principle, and the Onus of Proof. The court urges the Central and State Governments to take appropriate action urgently based on the recommendations provided. The court has referred certain technical and scientific aspects to an expert body for investigation and opinion.
