The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by Naba Kumar Sarkar against the National Investigation Agency's refusal to produce documents and relevant material under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court cites a Supreme Court ruling that documents can only be ordered to be produced if they are necessary or desirable for the purpose of investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code. The court also notes that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come until the stage of defense.

The court order states that the accused cannot seek an order under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. until the stage of defense. The document sought to be summoned must be relevant to the stage of the case, and Section 91 does not confer any right on the accused to produce a document in his possession to prove his defense. The trial in the present case has not reached the stage of defense, so the appeal is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to agitate the claim for defense at the appropriate stage of the trial.

To understand the court order, it is important to first understand what Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure entails. Section 91 empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or other thing that the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code. This section is often used by investigating agencies to obtain documents or other material that may be relevant to a case.

In the present case, Naba Kumar Sarkar had filed an appeal against the National Investigation Agency's refusal to produce documents and relevant material under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court, however, dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come until the stage of defense.

The court cited a Supreme Court ruling in support of its decision. In the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, the Supreme Court had held that documents can only be ordered to be produced if they are necessary or desirable for the purpose of investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code. The court had also held that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come until the stage of defense.

The court order further clarified that the document sought to be summoned must be relevant to the stage of the case. Section 91 does not confer any right on the accused to produce a document in his possession to prove his defense. In other words, the accused cannot use Section 91 to obtain documents that are not relevant to the stage of the case or to prove his defense.

In the present case, the trial had not reached the stage of defense, and therefore, the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to agitate the claim for defense at the appropriate stage of the trial. This means that Naba Kumar Sarkar can still seek an order under Section 91 at the appropriate stage of the trial if he can establish that the document sought to be summoned is relevant to the stage of the case and necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an appeal filed by Naba Kumar Sarkar against the National Investigation Agency's refusal to produce documents and relevant material under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come until the stage of defense. The court also clarified that the document sought to be summoned must be relevant to the stage of the case and that Section 91 does not confer any right on the accused to produce a document in his possession to prove his defense. The appeal was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to agitate the claim for defense at the appropriate stage of the trial.
