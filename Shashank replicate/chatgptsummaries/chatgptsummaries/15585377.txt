The Patna High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to three civil writ jurisdiction cases filed by Bikas Kumar Jha against the State of Bihar and others. The petitioner had sought the issuance of appropriate writs, orders, and directions to calculate the compounding amount so that he could comply with the conditional order passed in A.B.P. Nos. 2106 of 2017, 2105 of 2017 and 2107 of 2017, for grant of anticipatory bail.

The court was informed that the compounding amount of Rs. 5000/- each had been fixed in all the three writ petitions and the petitioner had already deposited the amount in the court below through challan. The court disposed of all the writ petitions as having become infructuous.
