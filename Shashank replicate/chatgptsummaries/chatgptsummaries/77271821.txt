The court order pertains to multiple cases related to mining activities of English Indian Clays Limited. The cases involve issues such as violation of the Paddy Land Act, seeking police protection for mining and transportation of china clay, withdrawal of interdiction on mining activities, and seeking interdiction of mining activities for lack of prior Environmental Clearance. The court heard all the cases and delivered a judgment on October 4, 2018. The order also mentions specific arguments made by the appellants in one of the cases regarding the requirement of prior Environmental Clearance for mining areas in excess of 5 hectares.

In another case, the court discusses arguments made by various parties regarding the requirement of prior environmental clearance (EC) for mining areas in excess of 5 hectares. The appellants allege that the mining company violated lease conditions and did not obtain prior EC. The respondent argues that EC is only required for areas less than 5 hectares and that the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) recommended issuance of EC. The petitioners argue that the mining activity should be stopped and the value of illegally quarried minerals recovered. The court ultimately agrees with the Division Bench order and finds suppression on the part of one of the petitioners.

The court also discusses a case involving a mining company that began operations without obtaining an environmental clearance (EC) for their leased land. The court notes that the company had been running from pillar to post to obtain an EC, but had only initiated the process in 2015, by which time they had already commenced activities on the land. The court also highlights the company's suppression of pending litigation and their inability to co-relate matters dealt with in each of their cases. The court ultimately rules against the company and orders them to stop mining activities until they obtain the necessary EC.

In yet another case, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents living near a mining area. The court found that the mining company had ownership over only 26.6 acres of land in the total lease area of 35 acres and had commenced operations based on an approved mining plan, confining mining activities to the extent belonging to the company. However, the court found that the mining activity commenced by the company without a prior environmental clearance was illegal. The court also noted that the SEAC had recommended against issuing an EC due to violations of the notification dated 27.01.1994. The court rejected the contention of the company that the violations were never informed to them.

The court order discusses violations of environmental regulations by a mining company in India. The government did not initiate any proceedings despite the violations being confirmed by the SEAC and State Expert Appraisal Authority (SEIAA). The company commenced mining without obtaining prior EC, and also did not have consent from all landowners. The government officers displayed a lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing environmental protection laws. The court also refers to a regional environmental impact assessment study that highlighted concerns about depletion of water levels, dust emissions, and environmental degradation caused by the mining activities. Despite the detailed study and reports of environmental depredation, the company was allowed to continue its operations without any action being taken by the government.

In another case, the court order discusses violations by a mining company and the government's failure to take action. The court references previous litigation and government orders that allowed for renewals of permits without proper environmental clearance. The court also notes the Director of Mining and Geology's failure to obtain consent from all landowners within the leased area and the Indian Bureau of Mines' communication regarding inspection of the area. The court ultimately condemns the government's inaction and the company's violations.

The court order states that environmental clearance is required at the time of renewal of mining permits, and that there is no law stating otherwise. The court also notes that the State cannot be absolved from following the regulations laid down by the Apex Court in Deepak Kumar's case, and that the proviso to R.12 inserted by Notification dated 05.10.2015 cannot be said to be in accordance with the ratio of the judgment laid down in Deepak Kumar's case. The court also emphasizes the need for sustained development and effective implementation of laws to protect the environment.

In a case of illegal mining in a narrow strip of land between mountains and the sea, the court found that the government and its officers allowed mining without any care for the environment and ignored the pleas of local residents. The court found that large-scale mining had caused environmental damage and that an impact assessment study would be futile. The court dismissed a writ petition seeking police protection for transporting crude china clay and directed the company to proceed as directed by the learned Single Judge within three weeks. The court also allowed two writ petitions and directed the government to implement the judgment in Common Cause by conducting an inspection of the site and recovering 100% of the value of materials excavated from the land.

Finally, the court order directs the Directorate of Mining and Geology to inspect the premises and recover 100% of the value of illegally extracted China clay and overburden. The District Collector is instructed to take possession of the land to facilitate an independent inquiry. The court finds the company's actions to be an abuse of process and imposes a cost of Rs. 10 lakhs on the company, to be paid to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. Private parties who were not impleaded in the writ petition seeking EC for mining are entitled to costs. The
