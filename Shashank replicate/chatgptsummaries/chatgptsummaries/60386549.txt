The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Deepak Rathore, who is accused of various offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicant on furnishing a personal bond and sureties.

The FIR alleges that the applicant, along with several others, committed various offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

The first condition is that the applicant must cooperate with the investigation/trial and attend all court hearings as and when required. The court notes that failure to comply with this condition may result in the cancellation of bail.

The second condition is that the applicant must not commit any similar offenses while out on bail. The court notes that if the applicant is found to have committed any offense while out on bail, his bail may be cancelled.

The third condition is that the applicant must mark his presence at the police station every fifteen days. The court notes that this is to ensure that the applicant remains available for the investigation/trial and does not abscond.

The court also directs the applicant to furnish an undertaking that he will comply with all the conditions imposed by the court and that he will not tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses.
