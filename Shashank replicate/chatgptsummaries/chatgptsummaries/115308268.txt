The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Jaswant Singh against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The petition was filed after Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh filed a PIL in 2009 regarding the same issue. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was eventually tasked with adjudicating the matter. The NGT issued various orders, including directing the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court order also mentions the need for the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them.

The court has ordered the State to take steps for the construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. They have also directed the State/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water. The court has requested the High Court of Rajasthan to ensure the despatch and handing over of the records of WP No. 718/2009. The court has also directed the State to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue show cause notice to persons causing pollution. The State has been directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure.

The court ordered the state to remove structures that were causing contamination of the canal water and file a compliance report. The state claimed that there were no structures meant for canal maintenance contributing to contamination, but the court disagreed and ordered an inspection. The court also ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short and long-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The state was directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water and collect compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal. The court suggested that the persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the NGT.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and how it does not bar writ jurisdiction. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching a writ court and the circumstances in which this principle can be deviated from. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court has ordered that the petitioner(s) must file an application/representation by December 31, 2016, and until then, the state authorities cannot take any coercive action against them. The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone the delay in filing the application/representation and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. The NGT is requested to sympathetically consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner(s). After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT.
