The court has recently issued two orders related to the establishment of a poultry farm in a village. In the first case, the petitioner had sought to quash an order revoking the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for establishing a poultry farm due to public resentment against it. The Board had granted the NOC, but the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Rajpura, advised against it due to potential law and order issues. The petitioner had already started construction, but protests from neighboring villages and the Gram Panchayat led to the cancellation of the NOC. The court has issued notices to the respondents.

In the second case, the petitioner was granted permission to set up a poultry farm in a village, but the license was later revoked without giving the petitioner a chance to be heard. The court ruled that the rule of audi alteram partem, which mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard, is a well-accepted facet of the principles of natural justice and a person has a right to be heard before any order adverse to him and affecting his rights is passed. The court invalidated the order revoking the license and remitted the matter back to the Board for passing a fresh order after hearing the petitioner. The court also ordered that status quo with regard to the position at the site shall be maintained by the petitioner until the matter is heard and decided.

The establishment of a poultry farm in a village can be a contentious issue, as it can lead to concerns about pollution, noise, and other environmental issues. In the first case, the Board had granted the NOC for the establishment of the poultry farm, but the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had advised against it due to potential law and order issues. The petitioner had already started construction, but protests from neighboring villages and the Gram Panchayat led to the cancellation of the NOC.

The court has issued notices to the respondents in this case, indicating that it will hear both sides of the argument before making a decision. This is an important aspect of natural justice, as it ensures that both parties have an opportunity to present their case and that the decision is based on all the relevant facts.
