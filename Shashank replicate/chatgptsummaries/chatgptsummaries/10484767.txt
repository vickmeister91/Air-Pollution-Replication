The court order pertains to 38 writ petitions filed by builders of various properties in Delhi who have been issued show cause notices and directions by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for alleged violation of the Water Act and the Air Act. The show cause notices have been issued on the ground that these petitioners had not, prior to commencing construction, applied to the DPCC for and obtained from it the 'consent to establish' under Section 25 of the Water Act or the DPCC's 'consent to operate' under Section 21 of the Air Act. The court order discusses the applicability of the Water Act to the complexes in question and the validity of the levy by the DPCC of penalties, fines, and environment damages.

The Water Act was enacted in 1974 to prevent water pollution. The Act was amended in 1988 to make it mandatory for anyone establishing an industry, operation, or process that could cause water pollution to obtain prior consent from the State Pollution Control Committee. Section 25 of the Water Act outlines the requirements for obtaining consent and imposes restrictions on new outlets and discharges. The court is examining whether there is a statutory requirement for obtaining prior consent to establish commercial or residential complexes. The definitions of terms such as "outlet," "sewage effluent," and "trade effluent" are also relevant to understanding the scope of the Act.

The court concludes that the provision applies not only to industrial activities but also to all kinds of processes and operations, including those in residential and commercial complexes. The court also emphasizes the need for effective prevention and control of pollution and adopts a purposive approach to interpret the legislation. The court further notes that the discharge of large volumes of sewage from residential complexes can have a significant impact on water pollution.

The court rejects the argument that the DPCC cannot exercise powers in relation to water and sewage control if the MCD has exclusive powers in this regard. The order also mentions the deeming provision of Section 25(7) of the Water Act, which grants consent to establish if no decision is communicated by the DPCC within four months of application.

The court order discusses the legal position under the Water Act and the Air Act in relation to commercial shopping complexes, shopping malls, and residential complexes. It states that obtaining prior consent to establish or operate is necessary under the Water Act, and that the DPCC should invoke its powers under Section 25(5) of the Water Act if consent has not been obtained. Under the Air Act, obtaining prior consent to operate is necessary for industrial plants in air pollution control areas, but residential complexes are not included. The use of DG sets in commercial shopping complexes or shopping malls may attract the provisions of the Air Act, but the applicability of the Act to ongoing construction and functional buildings is different.

The court order discusses the meaning of "industrial plant" and concludes that it cannot be stretched to include a residential complex. While a commercial complex or shopping mall would be covered under the Air Act, a purely residential complex does not require prior consent to operate under Section 21(1) of the Air Act. However, during construction and after completion, all buildings must comply with the norms under the Air Act and the Water Act. The order also discusses the requirements for obtaining EIA clearance for construction projects, including details about water and air pollution.

The court order discusses the requirement for obtaining consent to establish and operate under the Water Act and Air Act, even if the project has already obtained EIA clearance. The DPCC has the power to issue directions and order closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process, but it must follow the principles of natural justice. The Chairman of the DPCC cannot sub-delegate his powers to the Consent Management Committee. The decision to grant or refuse consent should be taken independently by the Chairman. The order also discusses the impact of DG sets and other equipment on noise levels and vibrations and the measures proposed for mitigation.

The court found that the orders issued by the DPCC requiring bank guarantees and levying penalties were not sustainable in law and set them aside. The court also found that the DPCC did not follow the required procedures under the Air Act and Water Act in levying damages and requiring bank guarantees. The court emphasized that the DPCC's coercive power must be exercised with caution and after complying with due process requirements. The court provided several conclusions, including the requirement for prior consent to establish a commercial shopping complex or residential complex under the Water Act and the mandatory requirement for obtaining an EIA clearance for built-up areas over 20,000 sq.m.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Water Act, the Air Act, and other environmental statutes that apply to all types of buildings and activities during and after construction. The court also states that closure orders should not be invoked without giving an opportunity to rectify defects detected during an inspection. The Chairman of the DPCC has no power to sub-delegate the powers delegated to him, and committees established by the Chairman have no power to decide whether to grant or refuse consent to establish or operate. The court also discusses the case of Vardhman Properties Ltd. and sets aside the impugned order requiring the petitioner to apply for prior consent to establish and consent to operate under the Air Act and the Water Act respectively. The court leaves it open to the DPCC to proceed in accordance with relevant provisions of the Air Act and the Water Act.
