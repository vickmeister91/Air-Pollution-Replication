The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently issued a court order regarding two petitions seeking the quashing of a complaint and summoning order under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint was filed by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Unitech Limited and others for violating the notification on Environment Impact Assessment of Development Projects. The accused were accused of starting construction without obtaining prior Environment Clearance and committing a continuous offense until the clearance was obtained.

The court order states that the accused persons in charge of a construction project have criminally conspired to carry out the project in violation of environmental regulations and without obtaining necessary clearances. However, the court allows the petitions filed by the accused, stating that the continuation of criminal proceedings against them would be an abuse of process of law, as they had obtained the necessary clearance certificate before starting the work. The court cites the State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal case and warns that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection.

The court order quashes the criminal case against M/s Unitech Limited and others filed by the Gurgaon Region Haryana State Pollution Control Board under Section 15 of the Act, along with the summoning order and subsequent proceedings. The order was issued on July 10, 2013, by Judge Sabina.
