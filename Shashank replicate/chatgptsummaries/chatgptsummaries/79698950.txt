The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s Swami Parmanand Bhatta Company, Baghpat, seeking a mandamus to restrain the respondents from interfering in the manufacture of bricks by the petitioner in the traditional form by the method of burnt clay. The petitioner had argued that the use of fly ash in the manufacture of bricks was not feasible for them and that they should be allowed to continue using the traditional method of burnt clay.

The court heard the U.P. Pollution Control Board on the issue of restrictions on the brick kilns owners, who were directed to use 25% fly ash in the manufacture of brick kilns. The Board had argued that the use of fly ash was necessary to reduce pollution and protect the environment. The court observed that the use of fly ash was a necessary measure to reduce pollution and that the writ petitioner could not claim that they had a right to operate the brick kiln without having necessary permissions under the relevant Acts.

The court further observed that the writ petitioner had to obtain necessary permissions before an industry could be set up or run. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions and therefore could not claim that they had a right to operate the brick kiln without restrictions. The court dismissed the writ petition.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the importance of environmental protection measures and the need for industries to obtain necessary permissions before setting up or operating. The use of fly ash in the manufacture of bricks is an important measure to reduce pollution and protect the environment. The court's decision reinforces the need for industries to comply with environmental regulations and obtain necessary permissions before setting up or operating. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by M/s Swami Parmanand Bhatta Company, Baghpat, reinforces the importance of environmental protection measures and the need for industries to comply with regulations and obtain necessary permissions before setting up or operating. The use of fly ash in the manufacture of bricks is an important measure to reduce pollution and protect the environment.
