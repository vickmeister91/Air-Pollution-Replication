The recent court order pertains to a petition challenging a letter issued by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India. The letter in question clarified the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification dated 19th February 1991, which regulates activities in coastal stretches and divides them into four categories. The present case concerns CRZ-II, which pertains to areas that have already been developed up to a certain extent.

The clarification issued by the Respondent No. 2 pertained to the interpretation of the phrase "Existing Authorised Buildings" and the norms of Floor Space Index (FSI) and Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The petitioner had argued that the clarification was in violation of the original notification and would lead to the destruction of the coastal environment. The petitioner had also contended that the clarification would benefit only a few builders and developers who had already constructed buildings in the CRZ-II areas.

The court, however, held that the clarification was in consonance with the original notification and did not amend or modify it. The court observed that the phrase "Existing Authorised Buildings" had been defined in the notification itself and the clarification only reiterated the same. The court also noted that the norms of FSI and FAR had been prescribed in the original notification and the clarification did not alter them in any way.

The court further observed that the CRZ notification was a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the coastal environment and ensuring sustainable development. The court noted that the notification had undergone several amendments over the years, and the clarification issued by the Respondent No. 2 was a part of the ongoing process of interpretation and implementation of the notification.

The court also rejected the petitioner's contention that the clarification would benefit only a few builders and developers. The court observed that the clarification would apply to all existing authorised buildings in the CRZ-II areas, irrespective of the identity of the builder or developer. The court also noted that the clarification would not apply to any new construction in the CRZ-II areas.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the petition challenging the clarification issued by the Respondent No. 2. The court held that the clarification was valid and in accordance with the CRZ notification. The court also observed that any grievances arising out of the implementation of the notification could be addressed through the appropriate legal remedies.

The court order is significant as it reaffirms the validity of the CRZ notification and the ongoing process of interpretation and implementation of the same. The order also highlights the importance of balancing environmental protection with sustainable development, and the need for a regulatory framework to achieve this balance. The order is likely to have implications for future cases involving the interpretation and implementation of the CRZ notification, and for the development of coastal areas in general.
