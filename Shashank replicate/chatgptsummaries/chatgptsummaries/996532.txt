The Mewar Chamber of Commerce and Association of Industries challenged the validity of the Nagar Parishad Bhilwara (Pradushan Janya Vyavsay Kar) Niyam 2001, which imposed a tax on trade and callings engaged in textile processing or trading of raw materials within the boundaries of the Municipal Council, Bhilwara. The tax was levied to ease the burden on the Municipal Council, which was under obligation to set up waste processing and disposal facilities and undertake other measures to prevent pollution caused by the textile industries. The court held that the tax was within the legislative competence of the State and the Rules of 2001 were held to be intravires of the Constitution of India.

The case of Mewar Chamber of Commerce and Association of Industries v. State of Rajasthan was heard by the Rajasthan High Court. The case involved a challenge to the validity of the Nagar Parishad Bhilwara (Pradushan Janya Vyavsay Kar) Niyam 2001, which imposed a tax on trade and callings engaged in textile processing or trading of raw materials within the boundaries of the Municipal Council, Bhilwara. The tax was levied to ease the burden on the Municipal Council, which was under obligation to set up waste processing and disposal facilities and undertake other measures to prevent pollution caused by the textile industries.

The Mewar Chamber of Commerce and Association of Industries argued that the tax was unconstitutional as it violated the fundamental right to carry on trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. They also argued that the tax was beyond the legislative competence of the State as it was not related to any of the subjects enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

The State of Rajasthan argued that the tax was within its legislative competence as it was related to the subject of taxes on professions, trades, callings, and employments, which is listed in Entry 60 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The State also argued that the tax was a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business as it was imposed in the interest of public health and the environment.

The court held that the tax was within the legislative competence of the State and the Rules of 2001 were held to be intravires of the Constitution of India. The court noted that Entry 60 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution empowers the State Legislature to levy taxes on professions, trades, callings, and employments. The court also held that the tax was a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business as it was imposed in the interest of public health and the environment.

The court observed that the textile industries in Bhilwara were causing pollution and the Municipal Council was under obligation to set up waste processing and disposal facilities and undertake other measures to prevent pollution caused by the textile industries. The court noted that the tax was levied to ease the burden on the Municipal Council and to ensure that the textile industries contribute to the cost of setting up waste processing and disposal facilities and other measures to prevent pollution caused by them.

The court also rejected the argument that the tax was beyond the legislative competence of the State as it was not related to any of the subjects enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The court held that the tax was related to the subject of taxes on professions, trades, callings, and employments, which is listed in Entry 60 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court upheld the validity of the Nagar Parishad Bhilwara (Pradushan Janya Vyavsay Kar) Niyam 2001, which imposed a tax on trade and callings engaged in textile processing or trading of raw materials within the boundaries of the Municipal Council, Bhilwara. The court held that the tax was within the legislative competence of the State and the Rules of 2001 were held to be intravires of the Constitution of India. The court also held that the tax was a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or business as it was imposed in the interest of public health and the environment.
