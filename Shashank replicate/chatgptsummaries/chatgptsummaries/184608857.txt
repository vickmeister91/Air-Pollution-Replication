The Karnataka High Court recently passed a court order in a writ petition filed by Smt Jalajakshi against the Karnataka State Transport Authority. The petitioner had sought to quash a resolution passed by the respondent in 1999, which had cancelled the petitioner's permit for operating a vehicle on a specific route. The petitioner had argued that the cancellation was in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act and the principles of natural justice.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the writ petition and set aside the impugned orders. The court observed that the cancellation of the petitioner's permit was not in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the respondent had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before cancelling the permit.

The court order requires the petitioner to obtain necessary documents for the vehicle and for the respondent authority to consider the case and make a decision in accordance with the law for cancellation of the permit if necessary. The petitioner must comply within 15 days and the respondent must file their appearance within four weeks.

The court order is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. The court has given the petitioner an opportunity to replace the vehicle and apply for renewal of the permit. This will enable the petitioner to continue operating the vehicle on the specific route.

The court order also highlights the importance of following due process of law while cancelling permits. The respondent authority must consider the case and make a decision in accordance with the law. This will ensure that the rights of the petitioner are protected and that justice is done.
