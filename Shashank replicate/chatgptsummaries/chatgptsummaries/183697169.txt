The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal against the judgment and conviction of Rajinder Kumar for violating various provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India to regulate traffic on roads. The accused was found guilty of not parking his bus at the designated place and not driving with proper insurance. The appeal was dismissed by the court, which stated that there was no illegality in the judgment and conviction.

The case against Rajinder Kumar was initiated when he was found to have violated several provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India to regulate traffic on roads. Specifically, he was found guilty of not parking his bus at the designated place and not driving with proper insurance. These violations were serious in nature and could have resulted in harm to other drivers and pedestrians on the road.

The trial court had found Rajinder Kumar guilty of these violations and had convicted him accordingly. Rajinder Kumar had then filed an appeal against this judgment and conviction, arguing that there were errors in the trial court's decision. However, the court dismissed this appeal, stating that there was no illegality in the judgment and conviction.

The court's decision to dismiss the appeal was based on a careful review of the trial court record and the arguments presented by Rajinder Kumar's legal team. The court found that the trial court had followed all necessary procedures and had made a fair and impartial decision based on the evidence presented. The court also noted that the violations committed by Rajinder Kumar were serious in nature and could have resulted in harm to others on the road.

As a result of the court's decision, the trial court record was sent back along with a copy of the order, and the file of the appeal was consigned to the Record Room. This means that the judgment and conviction against Rajinder Kumar will stand, and he will be required to serve any sentence that was imposed by the trial court.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following traffic regulations and guidelines to ensure the safety of all individuals on the road. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in upholding the law and ensuring that justice is served in cases of violations and crimes.
