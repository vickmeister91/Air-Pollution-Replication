The Indian judiciary has recently dealt with two cases related to mining leases granted to companies on forest land. The first case pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking to declare a mining lease granted to M/s. Lloyds Metal and Energy Ltd. null and void. The challenge to the lease is based on the argument that it takes away the right of tribals in the area to collect mining forest produce as their livelihood, and that the requirement of obtaining recommendations from the Gram Sabha or Panchayats prior to granting a prospecting license or mining lease in Scheduled Areas is mandatory. The State Government argued that the lease was granted after conducting a public hearing and that all necessary approvals were obtained. The court reviewed a list of dates and events related to the lease and reserved judgment.

The second case pertains to a mining lease for iron ore on forest land in Maharashtra. The lease was granted after all statutory requirements were met and the Central Government gave prior approval. The court dismissed a PIL filed in 2016, stating that it suffered from delay and laches. The court also found no illegality or violation of any provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 or the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. Another petition seeking to quash the working permission granted to the mining company was also dismissed.

The first case highlights the conflict between the rights of tribals and the granting of mining leases on forest land. The argument put forth by the petitioners is that the mining lease takes away the right of tribals in the area to collect mining forest produce as their livelihood. This is a valid concern as the livelihood of tribals is often dependent on forest produce. The requirement of obtaining recommendations from the Gram Sabha or Panchayats prior to granting a prospecting license or mining lease in Scheduled Areas is also mandatory as per the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. This act was enacted to ensure that the rights of tribals are protected and that they are consulted before any development activities take place in their areas.

The State Government argued that the lease was granted after conducting a public hearing and that all necessary approvals were obtained. However, it is important to note that a public hearing does not necessarily mean that the concerns of all stakeholders have been addressed. The court reserved judgment after reviewing a list of dates and events related to the lease. It remains to be seen what the judgment will be and whether the concerns of the petitioners will be addressed.

The second case pertains to a mining lease for iron ore on forest land in Maharashtra. The lease was granted after all statutory requirements were met and the Central Government gave prior approval. The court dismissed a PIL filed in 2016, stating that it suffered from delay and laches. The court also found no illegality or violation of any provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 or the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. Another petition seeking to quash the working permission granted to the mining company was also dismissed.

While the court found no illegality or violation of any provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 or the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, it is important to note that the granting of mining leases on forest land can have a significant impact on the environment and the livelihoods of local communities. It is therefore important that all stakeholders are consulted and their concerns are addressed before any development activities take place in their areas.

In conclusion, the recent court orders related to mining leases on forest land highlight the need to balance the interests of all stakeholders. While the granting of mining leases can bring economic benefits, it is important to ensure that the rights of local communities, especially tribals, are protected and that the environment is not adversely impacted. The courts have an important role to play in ensuring that all statutory requirements are met and that the concerns of all stakeholders are addressed.
