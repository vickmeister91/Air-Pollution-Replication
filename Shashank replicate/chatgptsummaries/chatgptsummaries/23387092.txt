The Central Information Commission (CIC) recently issued a decision in the case of Vijay Kumar G S vs Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The appellant had sought certified copies of studies on the effects of drinking water quality of class D and class E on human health. The Chief Public Information Officer (CPIO) of CPCB had replied that no such study had been conducted by the board. The CIC found no fault in the CPIO's response and dismissed the appeal.

The case pertains to the right to information (RTI) act, which was enacted in 2005 to promote transparency and accountability in government institutions. The act allows citizens to seek information from public authorities and mandates that such information be provided within a stipulated time frame. The act also provides for an appellate mechanism in case the information sought is not provided or is deemed unsatisfactory.

In this case, the appellant had sought information on the effects of drinking water quality of class D and class E on human health. Class D and class E are categories of water quality as defined by the CPCB. Class D water is considered suitable for bathing and washing, while class E water is considered suitable for irrigation and industrial use. The appellant had sought information on the effects of drinking water of these categories on human health.

The CPIO of CPCB had replied that no study had been conducted on the effects of drinking water quality of class D and class E on human health. The appellant had then filed an appeal with the CIC, challenging the CPIO's response. The CIC heard the appeal and found no fault in the CPIO's response. The commission noted that the appellant had not provided any evidence to suggest that such a study had been conducted by the CPCB. The commission also noted that the appellant had not provided any evidence to suggest that the information sought was held by the CPCB.

The CIC's decision in this case highlights the importance of evidence in seeking information under the RTI act. The act provides for the right to information, but it also places the burden of proof on the applicant. The applicant must provide evidence to support their claim that the information sought is held by the public authority. In the absence of such evidence, the public authority is not obligated to provide the information.

The decision also highlights the need for public authorities to maintain accurate records and conduct studies on matters of public interest. The appellant in this case had sought information on a matter of public interest â€“ the effects of drinking water quality on human health. The fact that no study had been conducted by the CPCB on this matter raises questions about the board's commitment to its mandate of protecting the environment and public health.

In conclusion, the CIC's decision in the case of Vijay Kumar G S vs Central Pollution Control Board underscores the importance of evidence in seeking information under the RTI act. It also highlights the need for public authorities to maintain accurate records and conduct studies on matters of public interest. The decision serves as a reminder to citizens and public authorities alike of the importance of transparency and accountability in governance.
