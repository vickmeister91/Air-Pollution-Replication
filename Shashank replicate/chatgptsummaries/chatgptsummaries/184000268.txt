The Hotel Association of Puri filed a writ petition challenging the inaction of the State Government and Puri-Konark Development Authority in not allowing construction activities within the prescribed norms of Coastal Regulation Zone-II in the town of Puri. The petitioner also assails the jurisdiction of the Puri-Konark Development Authority in so far as the provisions contained in Odisha Development Authorities Act, 1982. The case of the petitioner is that the members of petitioner have constructed their buildings as per the existing rules and guidelines at the relevant time as provided in Orissa Municipal Act, 1950 and Orissa Municipal Rules, 1953.

The court order discusses the various notifications and amendments made by the government regarding the construction of buildings in the Coastal Regulation Zone-II area of Puri-Konark Development Authority. The petitioner claimed that the restrictions on the height of the building as imposed by the Puri-Konark Development Authority runs contra the provision of the Orissa Municipal Act 1951 and Orissa Municipal rules 1953 regulating the permissible built-up area. The petitioner further contended that the Puri-Konark Development Authority intimates the parties following the norms of nine meters height and 33% floor area ratio (FAR) for the buildings within the CRZ II as a matter of practice, which is not permissible in the eyes of Law.

The court order pertains to a case where the Puri-Konark Development Authority issued a notice for demolition to members of a petitioner's association for violating building construction norms within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) II. The petitioner argued that the authority had no jurisdiction to interfere in the matter of construction and development of buildings and that its actions were in violation of the Municipal Act and rules therein. The petitioner also claimed that the Puri-Konark Development Authority had no authority to deviate from building and construction norms as stipulated under the Municipal Act and rules therein. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various notifications and correspondences before making a decision.

The court order discusses the regulatory authority for granting permission for regulating construction activities and clearing CRZ areas of Puri. The P.K.D.A. is declared as the regulatory authority, and the court notes that it must follow the provisions contained in the Coastal Regulation Zone notification. The court also notes that the P.K.D.A. has no power to modify or alter the CRZ norms or CZM plan. The court further discusses the Municipal Act and Rules and notes that the P.K.D.A. must act following the provisions contained in the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, the Environment (Protection) Rules 1986, and the provisions as contained in the Orissa Municipal Act and the Rules therein. 

The court concludes that any action undertaken by the Puri-Konark Development Authority under the provisions of Section 15, Section 16, or Section 91 & 92 of the Odisha Development Authority Act are per se illegal and such action cannot be sustained in the eye of law. The court order states that any action taken by the Puri-Konark Development Authority regarding building planning must follow the FSI/FAR norms that existed in February 1991. The Coastal States of India must follow the CRZ Notification of February 1991 for the approval of plans for building construction in CRZ areas. 

The Puri-Konark Development Authority must act as an implementing agency of the CRZ II and follow the provisions of the Municipal Act and Rules and the CRZ Notification. The impugned order is illegal and quashed, and the Puri-Konark Development Authority must restart the proceeding and decide the case strictly following the CRZ Notification and the provision of Law. The State Government has no jurisdiction in such matters, and the Coastal Zone Regulating Authority is competent in this regard. The writ petition succeeds to the extent directed hereinabove.
