The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the illegal construction and operation of hotels and commercial hospitality units near the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat, India. The Indian Hotels Company Limited filed an application to be joined as party respondents in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 284 of 2014 and requested that respondent Nos. 1 to 11 be restrained from taking any coercive action, including sealing the property in question. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the main subject matter of the Writ Petition (PIL) No. 284 of 2014 is for preservation of the Wildlife (Protection Act,1972) read with the Indian Forest Act and also Forest (Conservation Act, 1980). The court granted the draft amendments and further affidavit filed by the applicant and allowed the hotel to continue until the application for clearance from National Board of Wildlife and the Tourism Corporation is decided. The court also ordered that the seals may not be applied and prohibitory order may not be passed, otherwise, the applicant would suffer irreparable loss and injury.

In another court order, the court directed the impleadment of various district authorities and the Chief Conservator of Forest as party respondents. The authorities have been directed to prepare a panchnama of all such units and take appropriate action against those operating without permission. The court has also granted a Draft Amendment to one of the applicants seeking relief. The amendment lists several hotels and resorts that have not been inspected despite operating without proper permissions.

The court order also discusses various commercial hospitality units in Gir Forest that have not obtained the necessary NOC or have exceeded the permitted number of rooms. The court orders a committee to be formed to examine the records and determine if NOCs were granted by the Forest Department. If permission is granted, the seals on the rooms will be removed, and the electric connection will be segregated. The committee will also ensure compliance with the court's directions. The order applies to all unit holders, including those whose licenses or NOCs were suspended or canceled. The court also disposes of several interim applications.

In another court order, the court disposes of several applications related to the use of government land for commercial purposes. The court allows unit holders to apply for NOCs to increase facilities, but such permission cannot be acted upon without producing a copy of the order before the committee and the court. The court directs that no seal shall be removed unless expressly permitted by the court. The court also clarifies that the present order is interim and the legality and validity of NOCs or any construction made will be examined later. The court orders compliance with previous directions and warns of serious consequences for non-compliance. The court examines whether the applicant has an NOC from the Forest Department for any hotel in the forest area or wildlife sanctuary of Gir Forest. The court notes that an NOC can only be processed after approval and clearance by the National Board of Wildlife under the Wildlife (Conservation) Act, 1980.

In yet another court order, the court has ordered the Chief Conservator of Forest to grant permission for a hotel to continue operating until permission is granted from the Forest Department. The court has also stated that the hotel must obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and that the fact that the hotel is a lessee of a government company does not exempt it from this requirement. The court has emphasized that everyone must follow the same procedures for obtaining an NOC, regardless of their status or affiliation. The court has also noted that the validity of any granted NOC is yet to be examined in the main matter.

Finally, the court order prohibits illegal activity by individuals without permission from the Forest Department or competent authority. The applicant is allowed to be a party respondent in the main petition at their own cost, but the prayer to prohibit officers from discontinuing the use of the hotel or sealing premises is not granted. The application is disposed of and the Assistant Government Pleader is instructed to inform the concerned officer of the order.
