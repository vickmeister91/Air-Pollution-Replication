The court order pertains to a revision filed by Sunil Singh Tomar against the rejection of his application under Sections 91 and 233 of Cr.P.C. Tomar had sought to summon an enquiry report given by the SDO (P), Ambah, District Morena to Superintendent of Police, District Morena, and to requisition K.S. Bhadoriya, the then SDO (P), Ambah, District Morena as his defence witness. However, the court rejected the application, stating that the enquiry report had no sanctity in law and was against the spirit of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order affirms that the Trial Court did not make any mistake in rejecting Tomar's prayer to summon K.S. Bhadoriya as a defence witness. The enquiry report given by SDO(P), Ambah, District Morena has no sanctity in law as he cannot be termed as an investigating officer. The application filed by Tomar under Sections 91 and 233 of Cr.P.C. is also rejected. The revision is dismissed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the enquiry report submitted by SDO(P), Ambah, District Morena had no legal standing. The report was not prepared by an investigating officer and therefore could not be considered as evidence in the case. The court also noted that Tomar had already been granted permission to lead and prove his evidence, and the Trial Court would consider it in accordance with the law.

The court's decision to reject Tomar's application under Sections 91 and 233 of Cr.P.C. was also based on the fact that these sections did not apply to the case. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the production of documents and other material objects, while Section 233 deals with the examination of witnesses. The court found that Tomar's application did not fall under either of these sections and therefore could not be considered.

The court also affirmed that the Trial Court did not make any mistake in rejecting Tomar's prayer to summon K.S. Bhadoriya as a defence witness. The court noted that Bhadoriya was not an investigating officer and therefore could not be summoned as a witness. The court also found that Tomar had failed to provide any valid reason for summoning Bhadoriya as a witness.

In conclusion, the court order affirms the Trial Court's decision to reject Tomar's application to summon the enquiry report and K.S. Bhadoriya as a defence witness. The court found that the enquiry report had no legal standing and that Bhadoriya was not an investigating officer and therefore could not be summoned as a witness. The court also found that Tomar had already been granted permission to lead and prove his evidence, and the Trial Court would consider it in accordance with the law. The court's decision was based on the facts of the case and the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
