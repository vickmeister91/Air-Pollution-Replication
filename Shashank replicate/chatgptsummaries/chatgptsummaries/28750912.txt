The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) by the petitioners to set aside an order passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No. I, Salem. The order in question confirmed the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate No. I, Salem in CMP.No.7508/2010 in C.C.No.71 of 2007 dated 07.12.2010. The petitioners are accused in C.C.No.71 of 2007 under Section 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The petitioners had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to issue a summons to the Income Tax Officer, Salem, to produce the Income Tax Returns of the respondent for the period of two years, i.e., from 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 before the trial court. However, the said petition was dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate No. I, Salem, stating that the transaction between the petitioners and the respondent had not been shown in the Income Tax Returns filed by the respondent during the years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008.

The petitioners then preferred a Revision Petition before the Additional District and Sessions Judge-Fast Track Court No. I, Salem, on the ground that the documents proposed to be summoned were essential for them to prove their innocence and to disprove the case of the respondent/complainant. However, the said Revision Petition was dismissed on the ground that the proposed document of Income Tax Returns of the respondent for the years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 were necessary for the disposal of the case, and any admission made by the respondent during his cross-examination with regard to showing the transaction in the Income Tax Account could be relied upon by the petitioners for drawing adverse inference against the respondent.

The Criminal Original Petition was ultimately dismissed, leaving the petitioners with no recourse but to accept the decision of the court.

In summary, the case involved a dispute between the petitioners and the respondent under Section 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioners had sought to summon the Income Tax Returns of the respondent for the years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 to prove their innocence and disprove the case of the respondent. However, the court dismissed their petition, stating that the proposed documents were necessary for the disposal of the case and that any admission made by the respondent during his cross-examination could be relied upon by the petitioners for drawing adverse inference against the respondent. Ultimately, the Criminal Original Petition was dismissed, leaving the petitioners with no further legal recourse.
