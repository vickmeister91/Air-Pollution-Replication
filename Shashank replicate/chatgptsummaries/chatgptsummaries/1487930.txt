The court order discusses the Master Plan for Delhi, which aims to deconcentrate the population, industries, and economic activities in the city and relocate them to various priority towns in the National Capital Region (NCR). The order states that hazardous and noxious industrial units are not permitted in Delhi, and existing units of this type should have been shifted within three years of the Master Plan's publication in 1990. However, no action was taken, and these industries have been operating illegally in Delhi. The order also states that no new heavy and large industrial units shall be permitted in Delhi, and existing units of this type should shift to the DMA and the NCR. The court rejects offers made by some of these industries for modernization and conversion from polluting to non-polluting industries. The order also mentions the growing pollution in Delhi and the need to contain the city's population size within manageable limits.

The court order directs the Central Pollution Control Board to issue individual notices to industries contributing to air and water pollution in Delhi, indicating that they are polluting industries operating in non-conforming areas in violation of the Delhi Master Plan. The industries are asked to relocate themselves to conforming areas, and assistance will be provided if necessary. The court also directs the Secretary of the Urban Development Department to indicate which industrial areas are available for relocation. Despite several notices, only three industries offered to relocate themselves. The court orders the H category industries to be dealt with immediately for the purpose of relocation. The court also notes that there are 93,000 industries operating in Delhi, and the majority of them are in non-conforming use zones.

The court order discusses the relocation of 'H' category industries in Delhi due to pollution concerns. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee is directed to serve notices to these industries within two weeks, indicating that they must be relocated outside of Delhi. The industries will be provided with proper assistance by the Delhi Administration and other governmental authorities in the process of relocation. The court also discusses the NCR policy measures regarding dispersal of industries and the availability of alternate sites for relocation. Industries that wish to represent against their tentative categorization can file objections before the Central Pollution Control Board within one week. The Board will indicate which industries are 'H'(a) and 'H'(b) categories. The categorization made by the Board shall be final subject to modification by the court.

The court order outlines the allocation of land to shifting units at predetermined rates, with consideration for future expansion and modernization needs. Heavy industries requiring large sites may acquire additional land. Upon relocation, units will be treated as new and provided with facilities as per state industrial policy. Back-up facilities such as employee housing may be provided where necessary. The NCR planning board can provide loan assistance for the creation and development of industrial areas. A single window will be set up to facilitate relocation. The order also addresses restrictions on units that have taken loans from the Delhi Finance Corporation and the need for permission under the Industrial Dispute Act. The court has identified H(a) and H(b) industries and given them opportunities to file objections and represent themselves. Suitable incentives will be provided to the shifting industries, and the allotment of plots will be made on a priority basis.

The court order lists 168 hazardous industries in Delhi, including stone crushing companies, chemical factories, and paint manufacturers. These industries have been categorized as 'H' industries and fall under H(a) and H(b) categories under the Master Plan. The court order also mentions that three industrial units were not included in the list of 1226 industries and were not given public notice, but they filed objections before the Board and were categorized as 'H' industries.

The court order lists 168 industries that are categorized as 'H' category industries and cannot operate in Delhi. These industries must relocate to other industrial estates in the NCR and must stop functioning in Delhi from November 30, 1996. The concerned authorities must render all assistance to the industries in the process of relocation. The workmen employed in these industries are entitled to certain rights and benefits. The order also directs the closure of 762 industries that did not respond to the public notice published in various newspapers.

In summary, the court order addresses the issue of hazardous and noxious industrial units operating illegally in Delhi and the need to relocate them to conforming areas in the NCR. The court directs the Central Pollution Control Board to issue individual notices to polluting industries and provides assistance for their relocation. The court also outlines the allocation of land and facilities for shifting units and provides incentives for the shifting industries. The court lists the hazardous industries and categorizes them as 'H' industries, directing their relocation and closure of non-compliant industries. The order emphasizes the need to contain the city's population size within manageable limits and address the growing pollution in Delhi.
