The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in response to two writ petitions filed by the Subramaniya Siva Cooperative Sugar Mills Worker Welfare Union and the National Cooperative Sugar Mills Daily Wages Workers Union. The unions had sought the regularisation of the services of their members who are non-muster roll workers in the sugar mills. The court directed the Government of Tamil Nadu to consider the proposal for regularisation of the employees of the sugar mills and pass appropriate orders within three months. 

The issue at hand was the employment status of non-muster roll workers in sugar mills. Muster roll workers are those who are employed on a daily basis and are paid wages accordingly. Non-muster roll workers, on the other hand, are those who are employed on a contractual basis and are not entitled to the same benefits as muster roll workers. The petitioner unions argued that non-muster roll workers in sugar mills have been working for several years and should be regularised and given the same benefits as muster roll workers.

The court order is significant as it directs the state government to consider the proposal for regularisation of non-muster roll workers in sugar mills. The court has given the government three months to pass appropriate orders in this regard. The order also allows the sugar mills to continue engaging the members of the petitioner unions until a final decision is taken by the state government. 

The court order is a victory for the petitioner unions and non-muster roll workers in sugar mills. It recognises the contribution of non-muster roll workers and acknowledges their right to be treated equally with muster roll workers. The order also puts pressure on the state government to take action on the issue of regularisation of non-muster roll workers in sugar mills.

The court order is also significant in the context of the larger debate on labour rights and the gig economy. The gig economy is characterised by the use of non-permanent workers who are not entitled to the same benefits as permanent workers. This has led to a situation where workers are often exploited and denied basic rights. The court order in this case recognises the need to protect the rights of non-permanent workers and ensure that they are not exploited.

In conclusion, the court order in response to the writ petitions filed by the Subramaniya Siva Cooperative Sugar Mills Worker Welfare Union and the National Cooperative Sugar Mills Daily Wages Workers Union is a significant victory for non-muster roll workers in sugar mills. The order directs the state government to consider the proposal for regularisation of non-muster roll workers and pass appropriate orders within three months. The order also recognises the contribution of non-muster roll workers and puts pressure on the state government to take action on the issue of regularisation of non-muster roll workers in sugar mills. The order is significant in the context of the larger debate on labour rights and the gig economy and recognises the need to protect the rights of non-permanent workers.
