In the first court order, Dr. K Madan appealed against an order passed under Section 14(1)(k) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The order was issued due to the appellant's misuse of the premises by running a clinic, which was contrary to the terms and conditions imposed by the Land and Development Office on the respondent land-lady. The appellant contended that the order should not have been passed, and relied on the decision in Punjab National Bank vs. Arjun Dev Arora and Others. However, the court found that the order was warranted based on the evidence on record, and the appellant's misuse of the premises.

The second court order pertains to a case where a property was leased by the Delhi Development Authority, but the landlords allowed tenants to use a portion of the building for commercial purposes. The Development Authority issued a notice to the landlords to discontinue the commercial use, failing which the lease would be terminated. The landlords sought eviction of the tenants, but the tenants argued that the landlords were estopped from getting possession of the property because they themselves had let it out for commercial purposes. The court held that the legislature's policy was to put an end to unauthorized use of leased lands and that there could be no estoppel against the statute. The court also discussed the provisions of Section 14(1)(k) and subsection (11) of the Act, which give protection to tenants from eviction and an option to the controller to pass an order whereby recovery of possession may not be directed. The court held that sub-section (11) of Section 14 enables the controller to give another opportunity to the tenant to avoid an order of eviction, but where the authority concerned requires stoppage of misuse, an order to that effect has to be passed. The court upheld the orders of the lower courts and granted the appellant two months to comply with the order of the Additional Rent Controller.

In both court orders, the issue at hand was the misuse of leased property. In the first order, Dr. K Madan was found to have misused the premises by running a clinic, which was contrary to the terms and conditions imposed by the Land and Development Office on the respondent land-lady. The court found that the order to stop the misuse was warranted based on the evidence on record. In the second order, the landlords allowed tenants to use a portion of the building for commercial purposes, which was in violation of the lease agreement with the Delhi Development Authority. The court held that the landlords were not estopped from seeking eviction of the tenants, and that the legislature's policy was to put an end to unauthorized use of leased lands.

Both court orders also discussed the provisions of Section 14(1)(k) and subsection (11) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. Section 14(1)(k) provides for eviction of a tenant if the premises are being used for a purpose other than that for which they were let out. Subsection (11) of Section 14 gives protection to tenants from eviction and an option to the controller to pass an order whereby recovery of possession may not be directed. The court in the second order held that sub-section (11) of Section 14 enables the controller to give another opportunity to the tenant to avoid an order of eviction, but where the authority concerned requires stoppage of misuse, an order to that effect has to be passed.

In conclusion, both court orders dealt with the issue of misuse of leased property and the provisions of Section 14(1)(k) and subsection (11) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The court in both orders upheld the orders of the lower courts and granted the appellants time to comply with the orders to stop the misuse of the premises. These court orders serve as a reminder to tenants and landlords to abide by the terms and conditions of lease agreements and to avoid unauthorized use of leased lands.
