In 2005, the Supreme Court of India issued a court order regarding the conservation, preservation, and protection of forests and ecology. The court discussed the obligation of the government to conserve natural resources and protect the environment. The court also examined the compensation required for the loss of forest land and the effect on ecology when forest land is used for non-forest purposes. 

The court ordered the creation of a Compensatory Afforestation Fund to deposit all the money received from user-agencies towards compensatory afforestation, additional compensatory afforestation, penal compensatory afforestation, net present value of forest land, catchment area treatment plan funds, etc. The fund would be used for undertaking protection and conservation activities in protected areas of the respective State/UT. The court also recommended the involvement of user-agencies in undertaking compensatory afforestation and the use of local and indigenous species for plantations.

The court order discusses the recovery of Net Present Value (NPV) from user agencies in states where forest land has been diverted for non-forest use. The court accepts the recommendations of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and directs the Union of India to frame comprehensive rules for the management of compensatory afforestation funds. The order also establishes the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) for the management of funds towards compensatory afforestation, NPV, and other money recoverable in compliance with the conditions stipulated by the Central Government. 

The order suggests amendments to the CAMPA's Executive Body, accounting procedures, and the guiding principles for determining NPV. The court also addresses the issue of public utility projects being exempt from payment of NPV and the recovery of NPV from degraded forests. The court order discusses the concept of Net Present Value (NPV) and its relevance in valuing public projects like forestry. The order suggests that NPV should be based on Total Economic Value (TEV), which includes both tangible and intangible benefits. 

The order also emphasizes the importance of preserving biodiversity and the need for a long-term commitment to manage forests sustainably. The order suggests that a body of experts should examine the best method of valuation depending on factors like gestation period, rate of discount, density of the forest, and social benefits of the project. The order also discusses the correlation between economics and environmental management and the need for valuation beyond the present.

The court order discusses the classification of values associated with natural resources, including direct use values, indirect use values, and optional values. It also discusses the valuation of loss of forest and the importance of biodiversity valuation. The order suggests referring the matter to a committee of experts and addresses the constitutional validity of the Notification constituting CAMPA. The order references various constitutional provisions and the duties and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.

The court order discusses the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in auditing government expenditure and transactions. It also examines the constitutionality of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) and the imposition of Net Present Value (NPV) charges for the use of forest land. The court concludes that the fund generated by CAMPA cannot be considered a fund under Article 266 or Article 283 or Article 284 of the Constitution of India, and therefore, the provisions of the CAG Act would not apply. 

The court also emphasizes the importance of preserving natural resources for the public good and rejects the argument that the amount of NPV should be made over to the State Government. The court order states that natural resources are not owned by any one state or individual, but are for the public good and interest. The Indian Forest Act was enacted to consolidate the law relating to forests, and the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was enacted to further tighten the management and regulation of forests. 

The Forest Policy of 1988 aims to ensure environmental stability and maintenance of ecological balance, including atmospheric equilibrium, which are vital for sustenance of all life forms. The court emphasizes the constitutional imperative to preserve and enhance forest cover as a natural gene pool reserve. The objective of the amount of NPV is to utilize the fund to conserve the ecology without affecting proprietary rights of the State Government over the land, timber, or minerals.

The court order discusses the need to conserve the environment and protect natural resources for future generations. It notes the depletion of forest cover in India and the importance of regeneration efforts. The court emphasizes that amounts under CAMPA must be used for the regeneration of ecosystems and cannot be handed over to any state government. 

The order also discusses the grant of exemptions to certain projects, such as government hospitals and schools, but notes that commercial ventures like NHPC must pay NPV to protect ecological and biodiversity. The court emphasizes the need to balance development and protection of the environment and notes that the sustainable use of biodiversity is fundamental to ecological sustainability.

The court order states that the submission that the government should not be charged NPV in protected forest areas cannot be accepted. The question of exemption for certain projects will be examined by experts, but revenue earning projects do not deserve the same treatment as non-revenue earning public welfare projects. The establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) requires permission from the court. 

An expert committee will be appointed to examine issues related to forest values and determine who should pay for restoration and compensation. User agencies must give undertakings for further payment, and the report from
