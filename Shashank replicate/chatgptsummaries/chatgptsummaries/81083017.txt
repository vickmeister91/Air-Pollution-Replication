The case in question involves a writ petition filed by S. Selva Rajendran under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a declaration that S.31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is illegal and unenforceable. Additionally, the petitioner requested that the respondents consider the applications of the petitioner resubmitted on 18.3.2011 for consent to operate the ice manufacturing unit of the petitioner in accordance with the law.

However, the petitioner later withdrew the writ petition, and it was dismissed as withdrawn with no costs. This means that the court did not make a ruling on the legality of S.31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the petitioner's request for the consideration of their applications.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a law in India that aims to prevent and control air pollution. Section 31-A of the Act deals with the power of the State Pollution Control Board to issue directions to industries, factories, and other establishments to control and prevent air pollution. The petitioner argued that this section is illegal and unenforceable.

It is unclear why the petitioner withdrew the writ petition. It is possible that they reached a settlement with the respondents or that they decided to pursue a different legal strategy. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the reasons behind the withdrawal of the petition.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition as withdrawn with no costs means that the petitioner will not be required to pay any legal fees or expenses related to the case. However, it also means that the petitioner did not achieve their desired outcome of having S.31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 declared illegal and unenforceable or having their applications for consent to operate the ice manufacturing unit considered.

In conclusion, the writ petition filed by S. Selva Rajendran seeking a declaration that S.31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is illegal and unenforceable, as well as a request for the consideration of their applications for consent to operate an ice manufacturing unit, was dismissed as withdrawn with no costs. The reasons behind the withdrawal of the petition are unclear, and the court did not make a ruling on the legality of S.31-A or the petitioner's request for the consideration of their applications.
