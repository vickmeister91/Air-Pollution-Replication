In a recent court order, a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the court. The petitioner was the respondent in M.C. No.1 of 2018 on the file of the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Thrissur. The petitioner sought to quash Annexure-A1 conditional order and Annexure-A2 complaint filed by the 3rd respondent on the ground that there are provisions in the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and hence no proceedings can be initiated under Section 133 Cr.P.C. However, the court rejected this argument and dismissed the petition.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is an important piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, and lays down various provisions for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act also provides for the imposition of penalties for contravention of its provisions.

In the present case, the petitioner had argued that since there are provisions in the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, no proceedings can be initiated under Section 133 Cr.P.C. Section 133 Cr.P.C. empowers a magistrate to take action for the removal of public nuisances and other similar offences. However, the court rejected this argument and held that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 do not preclude the initiation of proceedings under Section 133 Cr.P.C.

The court observed that the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Section 133 Cr.P.C. serve different purposes and are not mutually exclusive. While the former aims to prevent and control water pollution, the latter empowers a magistrate to take action for the removal of public nuisances and other similar offences. The court held that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 do not preclude the initiation of proceedings under Section 133 Cr.P.C. and dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner.

This court order highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of different laws and their interplay. While the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 aims to prevent and control water pollution, it does not preclude the initiation of proceedings under other laws such as Section 133 Cr.P.C. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the various laws and their provisions in order to ensure compliance and avoid legal complications.
