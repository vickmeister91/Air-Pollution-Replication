The court order in question involves multiple criminal miscellaneous cases filed by different parties against Subramanian Swamy and others. The parties involved include Young Indian, Motilal Vora, Sam Pitroda, Suman Dubey, and Oscar Fernandes. The details of the cases and the legal representation for each party are provided in the order.

One of the cases pertains to a criminal complaint filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others for alleged fraud, cheating, and other offenses against the Congress Party and The Associated Journals Ltd. (AJL), publishers of the National Herald newspaper. The accused persons include Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, and Young Indian. The Trial Court summoned the accused persons, and during the pre-charge evidence, two applications under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. were moved by the complainant, which were allowed by summoning the documents. The petitioners filed petitions challenging the impugned orders, alleging that the orders were passed without due application of mind and without giving notice or opportunity of hearing to the petitioners. The court heard arguments from both sides and relied on various judgments to make its decision.

The court order discusses the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court states that a notice must be given to a person before any proposed action is taken against them, and the right to a hearing cannot be denied. The court also discusses the definition of a "document" and the circumstances under which Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. can be invoked. The court ultimately concludes that the orders passed in the present case do not reflect any necessity or desirability for summoning the documents in question.

The court has the power under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to order the production of any document or thing at any stage of any investigation, inquiry or other proceedings under the Code. However, the court must consider whether the production of the document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purpose of the trial or proceedings. The party seeking the production of the document must demonstrate to the court that it is material for arriving at a just decision in the case. The court has to satisfy itself as to the necessity or desirability of the documents sought to be produced.

The court order discusses the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of necessity and relevancy in allowing the production of such evidence and warns against allowing it on a mere asking or as a matter of routine. The order also highlights the need for notice and an opportunity for hearing before passing any judicial order, as it is a requirement under the principle of natural justice. The court notes that the orders in the present case were passed without notice or opportunity for hearing and without the necessary lists of witnesses and documents.

The court order states that passing a judicial order without providing a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the person likely to be affected by such order is violative of principles of natural justice. The order also mentions that the power of recall is different from the power of altering or reviewing the judgment. The complainant argues that notice is not mandatory before passing an order under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. as it is the discretion of the Trial Court whether a particular document should be summoned or not. However, the court disagrees and emphasizes the importance of providing an opportunity to the person likely to be affected by the order.

The court order discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The learned Magistrate had observed that there were no materials before him to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application was desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial. The High Court had interfered with the discretion conferred on the trial courts in the matter of summoning documents, which would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time. The court set aside the orders dated 11.01.2016 and 11.03.2016 and held that while passing the order under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents, if the other party has already joined the proceedings, it is entitled to be heard. The right of the complainant shall not be curtailed in any circumstance to move the fresh application during the pendency of the proceedings before the Court below.

In summary, the court order discusses the various aspects of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. It emphasizes the importance of providing notice and an opportunity for hearing before passing any judicial order and warns against allowing the production of evidence on a mere asking or as a matter of routine. The court also highlights the need for necessity and relevancy in allowing the production of evidence and notes that passing a judicial order without providing a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the person likely to be affected by such order is violative of principles of natural justice. The court sets aside the orders dated 11.01.2016 and 11.03.2016 and holds that while passing the order under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents, if the other party has already joined the proceedings, it is entitled to be heard.
