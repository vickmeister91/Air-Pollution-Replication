In a writ petition filed by Suraj K.S and Thilakan P.G against the State of Kerala and various other authorities, the petitioners sought the court's intervention to stop the reclamation activities in a particular area. The court heard the case on 5th October 2017 and delivered its verdict on 27th November 2017. The court order lists the exhibits submitted by the petitioners, including copies of various orders, letters, and photographs. Additionally, an additional party was impleaded in the case as per an order dated 27th November 2017.

The court order lists various exhibits and summarizes the facts of a case where petitioners are challenging the establishment of an industrial unit by the ninth respondent in a wetland area. The petitioners allege that this contravenes various environmental protection laws and regulations. The court order also mentions the counter-affidavit filed by the ninth respondent.

The court order states that the respondent must act upon the recommendation of the third respondent and restore the land to its original position. The ninth respondent argues that the writ petition is motivated by ulterior motives and that their proposed industrial unit is being established in collaboration with a Mauritius Company. The court examines whether the land in question falls within the scope of the Act and concludes that the land, which was originally a paddy land, would not fall within the definition of 'wetland' under the Act. The court also notes that the provisions contained in Rule 4 of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Rules, 2008 indicate that only wetlands that can be verified based on revenue records are liable to be included in the Data Bank.

The court order rejects the petitioners' claim that the land of the ninth respondent is a wetland and covered by the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010. The court also rules that the land in question is not covered by the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification and that the proposed activity of the ninth respondent is not prohibited under the CRZ Notification. The court concludes that the restrictions under the CRZ Notification would not apply to the land of the ninth respondent since it does not fall within any of the declared CRZ zones.

In another case, the court order dismisses a writ petition as the petitioners failed to prove that the land in question falls under any of the six categories of wetlands covered by Rule 3 of the Wetland Rules. The court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it.
