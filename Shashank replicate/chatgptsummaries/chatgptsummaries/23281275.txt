The court order pertains to an appeal filed by Rameshbhai J Dave, a power of attorney holder, against a judgment passed by a single judge in 2013. The appellant had been granted a lease in 1980, which was to expire in 2000. However, before it could expire, the appellant filed a renewal application under Section 24A(6) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. The court ordered the state authorities to take immediate steps to level the land and refill the upper soil available for the purpose. If there is no upper soil available, the authorities shall ensure that the ditches caused by mining are so levelled that there remains no endangerment to the life of wild animals.

The court order states that the government pleader presented photographs that showed how mining ditches filled with water endanger the lives of wild animals. The court ordered that the land should be leveled to ensure that the depth of the ditches remains minimal and that captured animals can escape naturally. The government pleader assured the court that these directions would be carried out by the state authorities. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant and reserved liberty in favor of the appellant to approach the court in case of difficulty. The court appreciated the action taken by the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Dhangadhara, Dist. Surendranagar. The civil applications were disposed of accordingly.
