The Kerala High Court recently heard an appeal against a judgment in a writ petition filed by T.G. Maniyamma against Koippuram Grama Panchayat. The petitioner claimed that the construction of a canal by the respondents would cause water and effluents to accumulate in her property, leading to soil erosion and crop damage. The Panchayat argued that the canal was necessary to divert water from a road during the monsoon season and that the petitioner had illegally blocked the natural exit of the culvert to the paddy fields. The court heard arguments from both sides and delivered a judgment on February 14, 2020.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the construction of a canal and diversion of water. The petitioner objects to the construction, claiming that it will damage their property. The court considers both sides and notes that the Panchayat maintains that they are only creating a water drain on the side of the public road to aid natural water flow, while the petitioner alleges that a new drain is being created with the specific intent of draining water into their property. The court orders further examination of the issue.

The court order involves a petitioner who requested that a drain be connected to a public canal to prevent flooding on her property. The court determined that the issue was too complex to be resolved through Article 226 of the Constitution of India and dismissed the writ appeal. The petitioner was granted the liberty to seek alternative remedies under civil law or approach the respondents to have the new drain connected to the public canal. The appeal was ultimately dismissed.
