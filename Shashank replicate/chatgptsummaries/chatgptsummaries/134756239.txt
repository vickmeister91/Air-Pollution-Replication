The court order pertains to a case where Dilbagh Singh Panwar and Smt. Sunita Panwar filed a petition seeking eviction of their tenant, Rajesh Kumar Khanna, from two shops they had let out to him. The petitioners claimed that they required the shops for residential purposes due to the increasing needs of their family. The respondent sought leave to contest the petition, citing various grounds, including the petitioners not being the exclusive owners of the property and already having sufficient accommodation. The court found that the respondent's denial of ownership was a hollow exercise and that the petitioners had established their bona fide requirement for the shops. The court ordered the eviction of the respondent from the tenanted shops.

The court order discusses a case where a landlord is seeking eviction of a tenant on the grounds of bona fide requirement. The court states that the tenant cannot dictate terms to the landlord and that the landlord's requirement must be genuine. The court also notes that the tenant cannot substitute their own assessment of space utilization for the landlord's understanding. The court ultimately rules in favor of the landlord, finding that the tenant had already put three shops to use for residential purposes and that the existing accommodation available to the tenant was not sufficient for their growing family.

The court order states that a landlord has the right to judge their own requirement for accommodation and a tenant cannot dictate the terms on which the landlord should live. The court finds that the petitioners have a bona fide requirement for greater accommodation due to their growing joint family. The respondent cannot interpolate his own version of utilization of space into the exercise which remains the sole prerogative of the petitioners. The application for leave to defend filed by the respondent does not disclose such facts as would disentitle the petitioners from obtaining an order with regard to the possession of the tenanted shops. An eviction order is passed against the respondent for two shops without any dividing wall in between. The petitioners would not be entitled to obtain possession of the above shops before the expiration of a period of six months from the date of this order.

In all three court orders, the issue at hand is the eviction of a tenant by the landlord on the grounds of bona fide requirement. The petitioners in all three cases claimed that they required the property for residential purposes due to the increasing needs of their family. The respondents in all three cases sought leave to contest the petition, citing various grounds, including the petitioners not being the exclusive owners of the property and already having sufficient accommodation.

In the first court order, the court found that the respondent's denial of ownership was a hollow exercise and that the petitioners had established their bona fide requirement for the shops. The court ordered the eviction of the respondent from the tenanted shops. The court did not find the respondent's arguments compelling and ruled in favor of the petitioners.

In the second court order, the court stated that the tenant cannot dictate terms to the landlord and that the landlord's requirement must be genuine. The court also noted that the tenant cannot substitute their own assessment of space utilization for the landlord's understanding. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the landlord, finding that the tenant had already put three shops to use for residential purposes and that the existing accommodation available to the tenant was not sufficient for their growing family.

In the third court order, the court found that the petitioners had a bona fide requirement for greater accommodation due to their growing joint family. The respondent cannot interpolate his own version of utilization of space into the exercise which remains the sole prerogative of the petitioners. The application for leave to defend filed by the respondent does not disclose such facts as would disentitle the petitioners from obtaining an order with regard to the possession of the tenanted shops. An eviction order is passed against the respondent for two shops without any dividing wall in between. The petitioners would not be entitled to obtain possession of the above shops before the expiration of a period of six months from the date of this order.

In all three court orders, the courts emphasized the importance of the landlord's bona fide requirement for the property. The courts also noted that the tenant cannot dictate terms to the landlord and that the landlord's understanding of space utilization is paramount. The courts ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners, finding that their requirement for the property was genuine and that the respondents' arguments were not compelling. The eviction orders were passed against the respondents, and the petitioners were granted possession of the tenanted shops.
