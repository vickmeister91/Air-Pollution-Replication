The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jithesh K.P, the third accused in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The accused was found transporting 140 kg of meat of a wild animal, alleged to be a Sambar Deer, and was subsequently arrested. The applicant claimed innocence and stated that he was unaware of the source or nature of the meat.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and the defence, allowed the bail application and ordered the release of the applicant on certain conditions. The court noted that the accused had no previous criminal record and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was involved in any illegal wildlife trade. The court also took into account the fact that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had not attempted to flee from justice.

The court imposed several conditions on the accused as a part of the bail order. The accused was directed to appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required and to cooperate with the investigation. The accused was also directed not to commit any offence while on bail and to furnish a personal bond and surety for a sum of Rs. 50,000 each.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have expressed concern that it may set a dangerous precedent and encourage illegal wildlife trade. The court, however, has made it clear that the accused will be closely monitored and that any violation of the bail conditions will result in the cancellation of the bail order.

The case highlights the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws in the country. Illegal wildlife trade is a serious threat to the survival of many endangered species and must be dealt with firmly. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused should not be seen as a reflection of the seriousness of the offence, but rather as a recognition of the principle of innocent until proven guilty.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Jithesh K.P, the third accused in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have expressed concern that it may set a dangerous precedent and encourage illegal wildlife trade. The court, however, has made it clear that the accused will be closely monitored and that any violation of the bail conditions will result in the cancellation of the bail order. The case highlights the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws in the country and the importance of innocent until proven guilty.
