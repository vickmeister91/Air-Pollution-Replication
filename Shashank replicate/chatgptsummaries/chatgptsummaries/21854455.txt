The court orders discussed in this document cover a range of civil cases involving disputes over property, breach of court orders, and violations of injunctions. In one case, Velbai filed a note to correct an error in a previous order that mistakenly directed her to undergo 7 days' civil imprisonment instead of her opponent, Natha Harji Halai & 13. The court corrected the error and disposed of the note accordingly. The rest of the document provides information on the appearance of the parties and the background of the case.

Another court order relates to a property dispute case where the defendants are accused of violating a court order by executing a sale deed after the order of status quo was passed. The plaintiff has filed a civil application for breach of injunction, and both parties have presented their arguments. The court has not yet made a decision on the matter.

In another case, the court discusses the arguments made by two advocates in a case involving a breach of court order. One advocate argues that the plaintiff has no case on merits and that the breach was not willful, while the other argues that the defendant should be held guilty for the breach. The court also references previous case law and orders related to the dispute.

The court also discusses various cases where parties were found guilty of contempt of court for violating court orders. In one case, the defendant was sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2,000 for violating a court order and entering into a sale deed that was declared bad and non-existent. In another case, the defendant was sentenced to seven days imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh for transferring suit land despite an injunction. The court also cites a case where it was held that even if an order is void, it must be declared so by a competent court and cannot be ignored by a party. Finally, the court cites a case where a party was found guilty of contempt of court for entering into agreements and accepting consideration during the pendency of proceedings, in violation of an interim order passed by the court.

In yet another case, the court states that the respondents have violated previous court orders and their actions would be considered as the creation of interest, which is prohibited by the court. The order also discusses the interpretation of Order 21 Rule 32 of the CPC and distinguishes it from the situation under Rule 2-A of Order 39. The court also refers to a previous case where the question of jurisdiction was raised.

The court order discusses a case where a landlord filed a suit against tenants for carrying out construction without permission after a fire destroyed the property. The defendants questioned the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the suit, but their plea was rejected. The high court later disagreed with the decision and held that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. However, the court emphasizes that just because an objection to jurisdiction is raised, the court does not become helpless, and it can grant interim relief. The court also states that the decision of the high court on the question of jurisdiction does not mean that no one can be punished for violating interim orders committed prior to the said decision.

In another case, the court states that even though the suit was filed in the wrong court, it was done so in good faith and the defendants cannot escape the consequences of their disobedience and violation of the interim injunction. The court cites previous cases to support the idea that those who disobey an injunction are liable to be proceeded against, and that false affidavits and disposal of property despite an injunction can lead to imprisonment and fines. The defendants argue that the company has its own distinct personality from an individual/director and cite a case where a dissolved company initiated legal action.

The court order cites a previous case where an interim injunction was not granted due to lack of evidence and the balance of convenience being in favor of bona fide purchasers. The order also discusses various facets of relevant considerations when breach of order is alleged and the defense available. The defendant in the present case has filed an affidavit stating that the applicant has delayed in moving the civil application.

In another case, the applicant had moved a civil application, which was listed for hearing on 06.04.2015. The court had ordered the parties to maintain status quo with regard to the disputed land until the next hearing on 18.06.2015. The opponent's advocate had requested time to file an affidavit in reply. The court had granted the request and passed the order to maintain status quo. The opponent's advocate had allegedly informed the applicant's local advocate about the status quo order passed by the court. However, the opponent's advocate had later informed the local advocate that he would not like to continue as an advocate and that the party may engage another advocate. The local advocate had taken a printout of the order from the High Court website on 09.04.2015 and had informed the applicant about the same.

In yet another case, the court discusses allegations of breach of an interim order by defendants who executed sale deeds despite the order. The court finds it difficult to believe that the defendants were unaware of the order and concludes that defendant no. 10 committed the breach. The court considers relevant aspects for punishment, including the timing of the order and the execution of sale deeds. The court rejects the argument that seeking time to comply with a condition is different from an order passed after hearing the parties.

Finally, the court order discusses a breach of an interim order and considers mitigating
