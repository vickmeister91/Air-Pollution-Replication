The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of two individuals in a criminal case involving the breach of the Water (Pollution and Control of Pollution) Act. The prosecution argued that the trial court had not properly considered the evidence and had erred in its interpretation of certain sections of the Act. However, the High Court noted that it should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach was vitiated by manifest illegality or the conclusion arrived at was perverse. The Court also reiterated that in acquittal appeals, the appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or give fresh reasoning if the reasons assigned by the lower court are just and proper.

This principle was established in the State of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy case, where it was held that if the appellate court agrees with the lower court's reasons and opinion, then a discussion of evidence is not necessary. In the present case, the trial court found that the prosecution failed to follow the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and that the complainant was not authorized to file a complaint against the accused. The trial court acquitted the accused, and the appellate court found no reason to interfere with this decision. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed, and any bail bonds were cancelled.

The Water (Pollution and Control of Pollution) Act is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution in India. It provides for the establishment of pollution control boards, the regulation of industrial effluents and sewage, and the prevention of water pollution from agricultural activities. The Act also imposes penalties for non-compliance, including fines and imprisonment.

In the case before the Gujarat High Court, the prosecution had alleged that the accused had violated the provisions of the Act by discharging untreated effluent into a nearby river. The trial court had acquitted the accused on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution had argued that the trial court had not properly considered the evidence and had erred in its interpretation of certain sections of the Act.

The High Court noted that it had the power to review and reconsider the evidence, but that it should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach was vitiated by manifest illegality or the conclusion arrived at was perverse. The Court also reiterated that in acquittal appeals, the appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or give fresh reasoning if the reasons assigned by the lower court are just and proper.

The Court then examined the evidence on record and found that the trial court had not erred in its interpretation of the Act. The Court noted that the prosecution had failed to follow the provisions of the Act by not obtaining the necessary consent from the pollution control board before filing the complaint. The Court also found that the complainant was not authorized to file a complaint against the accused, as he was not a person aggrieved by the alleged pollution.

Based on these findings, the Court held that the trial court's decision to acquit the accused was just and proper. The Court therefore dismissed the appeal and cancelled any bail bonds that had been issued.

The Gujarat High Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the provisions of the Water (Pollution and Control of Pollution) Act when filing complaints against alleged polluters. It also underscores the principle that appellate courts should not interfere with the findings of lower courts unless there is manifest illegality or perversity in the lower court's approach. This principle is crucial in ensuring that the justice system operates fairly and efficiently, and that the rights of accused individuals are protected.
