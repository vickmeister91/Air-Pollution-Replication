In a recent court order, a petitioner had issued a cheque of Rs. 9 lakhs to the respondent, which had bounced. The respondent filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for prosecution of the petitioner. The petitioner filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, praying that the complainant respondent be directed to produce his bank passbook, ledger, and account books to prove that he was possessed of Rs. 9 lakh on the said date when the loan was advanced. 

However, the court dismissed the application, stating that there was no basis for requisitioning the said documents and that the present petition was filed to delay the proceedings. The court dismissed the petition as being devoid of merits. This court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and not attempting to delay proceedings through frivolous applications.

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides for the regulation of negotiable instruments such as promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques. Section 138 of the Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The section provides for criminal liability for the drawer of the cheque, who can be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.

In the present case, the respondent had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act, alleging that the petitioner had issued a cheque of Rs. 9 lakhs which had bounced due to insufficient funds in the account. The petitioner had then filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The petitioner had prayed that the complainant respondent be directed to produce his bank passbook, ledger, and account books to prove that he was possessed of Rs. 9 lakh on the said date when the loan was advanced. However, the court dismissed the application, stating that there was no basis for requisitioning the said documents. The court observed that the petitioner had not made out any case for the production of the said documents and that the application was filed with the sole intention of delaying the proceedings.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not denied the issuance of the cheque or the fact that it had bounced due to insufficient funds. The court noted that the petitioner had not raised any defence or disputed the claim of the respondent. The court held that the petitioner had failed to make out any case for the production of the said documents and that the application was devoid of merits.

This court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and not attempting to delay proceedings through frivolous applications. The court has the power to dismiss such applications and impose costs on the petitioner for wasting the time of the court. It is important for litigants to understand the legal procedures and follow them diligently to ensure a fair and speedy trial.
