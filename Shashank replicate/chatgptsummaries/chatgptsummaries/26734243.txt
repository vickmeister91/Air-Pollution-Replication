The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation seeking a writ of Mandamus to shut down an offending unit running a Tyre Pyrolysis unit illegally in gross violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Haryana Pollution Control Board had already issued a closure order on May 26, 2016, and sealed the unit on December 1, 2016. 

The court directed the Pollution Control Board to verify allegations made by the petitioners about the illegal running of the unit during night time and take strict action if found to be true. The court disposed of the writ petition with the observation that the petitioners could move an appropriate application for revival of the petition in case of any violation or recurrence of the cause of action.

The writ petition was filed as a Public Interest Litigation, which is a legal action taken by an individual or group of individuals to promote the public interest. In this case, the petitioners sought a writ of Mandamus, which is a court order directing a public official or government agency to perform a specific duty. The duty in question was to shut down an offending unit running a Tyre Pyrolysis unit illegally in gross violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The Haryana Pollution Control Board had already issued a closure order on May 26, 2016, and sealed the unit on December 1, 2016. However, the petitioners alleged that the unit was still being run illegally during night time. The court directed the Pollution Control Board to verify these allegations and take strict action if found to be true.

The court disposed of the writ petition with the observation that the petitioners could move an appropriate application for revival of the petition in case of any violation or recurrence of the cause of action. This means that if the offending unit is found to be running illegally again, the petitioners can file a new application to the court to revive the case.

Overall, this court order is an important step in ensuring that environmental laws are enforced and that offending units are shut down if they are found to be operating illegally. It also highlights the importance of Public Interest Litigations in promoting the public interest and holding government agencies accountable for their actions.
