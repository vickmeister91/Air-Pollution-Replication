The petitioner had lodged an FIR stating that the complainant had misused a cheque, and the trial court had hurriedly closed the defence evidence of the petitioner.

The case in question revolves around an FIR lodged by Vishal Yadav, who alleged that the complainant had misused a cheque. The trial court had closed the defence evidence of the petitioner, which led to the filing of a petition under Sections 311 and 91 Cr.P.C. However, this petition was dismissed by the court, which prompted the petitioner to file another petition under Section 482Cr.P.C.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and granted one opportunity to the petitioner to step into the witness box as a defence witness. The court also directed that the trial be concluded within one month thereafter. This decision was made in light of the fact that the petitioner had been denied the opportunity to present his defence evidence, which is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to present his defence evidence is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that both parties be given a fair opportunity to present their case. The court's direction to conclude the trial within one month is also significant, as it ensures that justice is delivered in a timely manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision to allow the petitioner to present his defence evidence and to conclude the trial within one month is a welcome move. It upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that justice is delivered in a timely manner. This decision will also serve as a reminder to trial courts to ensure that both parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case.
