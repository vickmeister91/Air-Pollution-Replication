Tikaram was arrested in connection with a case registered under Sections 307 I.P.C. and Section 9, 27, 51(1) of Wild Life Protection Act, Police Station Tikonia, District Lakhimpur Kheri. The case pertains to the alleged poaching of a tiger in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. Tikaram was accused of being a part of a gang involved in the poaching of the tiger. The police had claimed that they had recovered a gun and other equipment used in the poaching from Tikaram's possession.

Tikaram had applied for bail on the grounds of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail. The co-accused, who was also a part of the same gang, had been granted bail by the court earlier. Tikaram's counsel had argued that since the co-accused had been granted bail, Tikaram should also be granted bail on the same grounds.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, granted bail to Tikaram on the grounds of parity with the co-accused. The court also imposed certain conditions on Tikaram's release, including not influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence, cooperating in the expeditious disposal of the case, and appearing before the trial court on specific dates. The court warned Tikaram that any violation of these conditions would result in the cancellation of bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Tikaram has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have criticized it, stating that it sends out a wrong message to those involved in wildlife crimes. Wildlife activists have expressed their disappointment with the decision, stating that it undermines the seriousness of the crime and sends out a message that wildlife crimes can be committed with impunity.

The case has once again highlighted the issue of wildlife crimes in India. Despite the existence of stringent laws to protect wildlife, cases of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife continue to be reported from various parts of the country. The need of the hour is to strengthen the enforcement of these laws and ensure that those involved in wildlife crimes are brought to justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Tikaram in Case Crime No. 77 of 2019, under Sections 307 I.P.C. and Section 9, 27, 51(1) of Wild Life Protection Act, Police Station Tikonia, District Lakhimpur Kheri, on the grounds of parity with a co-accused who has already been granted bail, has been met with mixed reactions.
