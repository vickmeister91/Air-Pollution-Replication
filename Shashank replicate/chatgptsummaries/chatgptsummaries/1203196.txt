The court order pertains to a contempt application filed by the petitioners against the respondents for not implementing the judgment of the court requiring the State Government to take a decision on the application submitted by the petitioners seeking permission to develop their plot. The court had directed the government to decide the application in the light of the recommendations made by the Competent Authority and the fact that other hotels were granted more FSI than 1.33 permissible under Rule 10(1) of the D.C. Rules, 1967.

The respondents approved additional FSI of 3.67 times the net plot area subject to payment of premium, which the petitioners claim is in breach of the court's directions. The petitioners contend that they are entitled to FSI of 6.29 on gross plot area as per Rule 10(2) of D.C. Rules, 1967, and are not liable to pay any premium.

The court found that the respondents had not willfully disobeyed the court's directions and dismissed the contempt application. The respondents had granted additional FSI to the petitioners in accordance with the relevant factors and had imposed a premium on them, which the court found to be justified.
