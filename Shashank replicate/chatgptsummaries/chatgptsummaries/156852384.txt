The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to disputes over land use and conservation in various areas of Delhi, India. One case concerns a road called the W-12D Link Road, with one group of plaintiffs claiming a right to continue using the road and seeking a declaration that it is a public way/right of way/easement, while the petitioners in the other case claim that the road has unauthorized constructions and encroachments and seek a writ of mandamus to remove them. The court ultimately rules that the road is a forest land and orders the removal of encroachments and unauthorized constructions.

Another case involves land in Village Neb Sarai, New Delhi, with issues including objections based on the Indian Forest Act, whether constructions are covered under regulations for unauthorized colonies, availability of alternate passages, protection under Delhi laws, claim under the Indian Easements Act, and the need to protect the environment. The court also mentions the history of the case, including a suit filed by other plaintiffs and various applications filed by residents of the area.

A third case concerns a dispute over a road on land that may be part of the protected Southern Ridge in Delhi, which is important for preserving forest and maintaining ecological balance. The court advises the petitioner to challenge the report before the Revenue Authority and maintains status quo until the appeal is disposed of. The court also highlights the significance of preserving the Ridge and its natural features.

The court also emphasizes the importance of conserving natural features in settlements, particularly the Ridge and Yamuna river in Delhi. It cites various notifications and orders related to the protection of these areas, including a Supreme Court order in 1996 that declared the Gaon Sabha land as part of the Ridge and prohibited any cultivation or construction on it. The court emphasizes that construction, development, or maintenance of a road on the protected forest area would not be allowed.

The court orders also discuss the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which prohibits the usage of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval from the Central Government. The Supreme Court has declared that the Ridge area cannot be utilized in any manner due to the prohibitions contained under the act. The court clarifies that all forest lands, whether notified under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 or not, would attract the prohibitions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court orders direct the construction of a boundary wall around a forest area to prevent encroachment and illegal construction. Private parties are illegally obstructing the authorities from completing the barricading. The private parties are asserting rights and entitlements of passage to the property they are occupying without any legal right or possession. The court rejects their challenge and directs them to comply with the orders of the Supreme Court and the law.

The court also discusses the concept of the Public Trust Doctrine, which holds that certain natural resources like forests, rivers, and the air should be held in trust by the government for the benefit of the public, rather than being subject to private ownership or commercial use. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving sensitive resources and the need for laws to account for the constraints imposed by the environment.

Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of balancing human needs with environmental preservation, and the need for proper management practices to protect endangered species. The court finds that the subject road in question was developed through the forest only to avoid traveling a longer distance to reach the destination and orders its removal. The court also orders the respondents to ensure the removal of all encroachments and unauthorized constructions and complete the boundary wall/fencing in compliance with judicial pronouncements and statutory provisions. The pending applications are dismissed, and compliance reports are to be submitted within eight weeks.
