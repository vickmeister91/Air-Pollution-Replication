The case at hand involves a writ petition filed by M. Joseph Rathnasamy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought the issuance of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the Consent Order No.007 dated 30.01.2002 issued by the Second Respondent, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and to restrain the Respondents from according any approval to the Sixth Respondent for running a manufacturing unit in Melamathur Village, Madurai. The petitioner contended that the unit set up by the Sixth Respondent would fall within the Industries listed in Annexure I of G.O.Ms.No.213 Environment and Forests (EC-1) dated 30.03.1989, which prohibits the establishment of Industries within 1 K.M from the embankments of the water sources.

The petitioner argued that the proposed factory would require a large amount of water and would generate polluted effluents, which would affect agricultural activities in the area. The court heard the submissions of the parties and considered the materials on record. The court order states that the decision to refer cases regarding the conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural land and construction of factories rests with the planning authorities. The court directed the appropriate authority to investigate whether the factory falls within the prohibited distance from water sources.

The court also noted that the factory has not obtained a consent letter from the agricultural department and ordered that the factory not be permitted to run in the future. The court's decision was based on the fact that the establishment of industries within 1 km from the embankments of water sources is prohibited under Annexure I of G.O.Ms.No.213 Environment and Forests (EC-1) dated 30.03.1989. The court also took into consideration the potential impact of the factory on agricultural activities in the area.

The court's decision highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need to protect water sources and agricultural activities. The court's order serves as a reminder to industries to comply with environmental regulations and obtain necessary approvals before setting up manufacturing units. The court's decision also emphasizes the role of planning authorities in regulating the conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural land and the establishment of industries.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a precedent for future cases involving the establishment of industries near water sources and agricultural land.
