The Madras High Court recently dismissed three Criminal Original Petitions filed by Jagmohan Meena and Dharmi Meena against the State. The petitions sought to set aside orders passed by the XIV Additional Special Judge for CBI Cases, Chennai-104, and direct the trial court to permit the petitioners to examine additional defence witnesses and produce certain documents. The court dismissed the petitions, stating that the petitioners had not made out a case for the examination of additional witnesses or production of documents at a belated stage of the trial.

The petitions challenged the dismissal of applications to summon witnesses and documents for the defence. The defence argued that the documents were essential for their case, but the court found that the details were within the knowledge of the accused and could be presented as defence evidence. The court also found no infirmity in the orders of the lower court and dismissed the petitions.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents should be allowed only if it is necessary for the just decision of the case. The court noted that the petitioners had not shown how the examination of additional witnesses or production of documents would be necessary for the just decision of the case. The court also observed that the petitioners had not explained why they had not produced the documents earlier or why they had not examined the witnesses earlier.

The court further noted that the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents at a belated stage of the trial would delay the proceedings and cause prejudice to the prosecution. The court emphasized that the trial should be conducted expeditiously and that unnecessary delays should be avoided.

The court's decision is significant because it reaffirms the principle that the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents should be allowed only if it is necessary for the just decision of the case. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of conducting the trial expeditiously and avoiding unnecessary delays.

The court's decision is likely to have an impact on future cases where the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents is sought at a belated stage of the trial. The decision is likely to be cited as a precedent in such cases and may influence the decisions of other courts.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision to dismiss the three Criminal Original Petitions filed by Jagmohan Meena and Dharmi Meena against the State reaffirms the principle that the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents should be allowed only if it is necessary for the just decision of the case. The decision also emphasizes the importance of conducting the trial expeditiously and avoiding unnecessary delays. The decision is likely to have an impact on future cases where the examination of additional witnesses and production of documents is sought at a belated stage of the trial.
