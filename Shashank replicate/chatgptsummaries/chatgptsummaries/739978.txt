The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) challenged the validity of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, which levies a cess on industries causing pollution. The issue at hand was whether the hydro power generating industry could be subjected to this cess. The Act was amended to include the industry, but the court found that the amendment was not valid as the necessary approval of Parliament was not obtained. Therefore, the levy and collection of the cess from the hydro power generating industry was not in accordance with the law. The court dismissed the appeals with no order as to costs.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons operating and carrying on certain types of industrial activities. The cess was intended to be used for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act was amended in 1991 to include the hydro power generating industry within its ambit. The NHPC challenged the validity of this amendment, arguing that the hydro power generating industry was not a polluting industry and therefore should not be subjected to the cess.

The NHPC contended that the hydro power generating industry did not consume water in the same way as other industries and therefore should not be subject to the cess. The NHPC also argued that the amendment to the Act was not valid as it had not been approved by Parliament. The NHPC further contended that the levy and collection of the cess from the hydro power generating industry was not in accordance with the law.

The court examined the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and the amendment made to it in 1991. The court noted that the Act was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons operating and carrying on certain types of industrial activities. The court also noted that the amendment made to the Act in 1991 included the hydro power generating industry within its ambit.

The court observed that the NHPC had contended that the hydro power generating industry did not consume water in the same way as other industries and therefore should not be subject to the cess. The court, however, found that the NHPC had not provided any evidence to support this contention. The court also observed that the NHPC had not challenged the validity of the Act itself, but only the validity of the amendment made to it in 1991.

The court then examined the validity of the amendment made to the Act in 1991. The court noted that the amendment had been made by the Central Government under the powers conferred upon it by the Act. The court, however, found that the necessary approval of Parliament had not been obtained before making the amendment. The court held that the amendment was therefore not valid.

The court then considered the levy and collection of the cess from the hydro power generating industry. The court held that since the amendment made to the Act in 1991 was not valid, the levy and collection of the cess from the hydro power generating industry was not in accordance with the law. The court, therefore, allowed the appeal of the NHPC and set aside the order of the High Court. The court dismissed the appeals with no order as to costs.

In conclusion, the court held that the hydro power generating industry could not be subjected to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, as amended in 1991, as the necessary approval of Parliament had not been obtained before making the amendment. The court also held that the levy and collection of the cess from the hydro power generating industry was not in accordance with the law. The court, therefore, allowed the appeal of the NHPC and set aside the order of the High Court. The court dismissed the appeals with no order as to costs.
