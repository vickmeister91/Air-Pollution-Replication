The Gujarat High Court recently issued two court orders related to the operation of chemical manufacturing units in the state. The first order granted permission for a chemical unit to conduct trial production, subject to certain conditions. The second order required a manufacturing unit to provide details about its raw materials and manufacturing processes to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and the Coordinating Committee. Both orders emphasized the importance of complying with environmental regulations and ensuring the safety of workers and nearby communities.

In the first order, the court granted permission for a chemical unit to conduct trial production, subject to certain conditions. The unit was required to deposit a sum of money and submit an undertaking to comply with various environmental regulations, including restrictions on the products it can manufacture and the disposal of effluent. The court also required the unit to provide information to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and other authorities.

The court's decision to grant permission for trial production was based on the unit's compliance with various environmental regulations.

The court also required the unit to provide regular updates to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and other authorities to ensure that it was complying with all regulations.

In the second order, the court required a manufacturing unit to provide details about its raw materials and manufacturing processes to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Coordinating Committee. The unit was required to provide figures for production and consumption of electricity and water on a weekly basis, including separate figures for effluent treatment plants. The GPCB and other authorized personnel were given the right to enter the factory premises and inspect the unit at any time without prior notice.

The court's decision to require the manufacturing unit to provide detailed information about its operations was based on the importance of ensuring that the unit was complying with all environmental regulations.

Overall, both court orders emphasized the importance of complying with environmental regulations and ensuring the safety of workers and nearby communities. The court's decisions were based on the need to balance economic development with environmental protection and public health. The court's emphasis on transparency and accountability in the operations of chemical manufacturing units is an important step towards ensuring that these units operate in a responsible and sustainable manner.
