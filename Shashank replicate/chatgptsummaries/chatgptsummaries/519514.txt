The Rajasthan High Court recently heard a case involving Maharaja Shri Umaid Mills and the State of Rajasthan regarding the discharge of industrial effluent into the Bandi river. The Water Pollution Board filed a complaint against the company for contravening provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The case was registered as a criminal miscellaneous case, and the application was dismissed when nobody appeared on behalf of the complainant. 

The Board filed an application for setting aside the order and restoring the application, which the Chief Judicial Magistrate allowed. The petitioners filed a writ petition against this order, arguing that the proceedings under Section 33 of the Act are criminal in nature and that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to revive and restore the application. 

The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the order. The court held that the proceedings under Section 33 of the Act are criminal in nature and that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to revive and restore the application. The court also held that the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate was without jurisdiction and was liable to be set aside. 

The court further observed that the Water Pollution Board had not followed the proper procedure for filing the application for restoration. The court noted that the Board had not filed an application for condonation of delay, which was necessary since the application for restoration was filed after the expiry of the limitation period. 

The court also observed that the Board had not given any reasons for its failure to appear on the date of hearing. The court held that the Board had not shown sufficient cause for its failure to appear and that the application for restoration was liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. 

The court further held that the Board had not complied with the provisions of Section 33 of the Act, which require the Board to give notice to the accused before filing an application for restoration. The court held that the Board had not given any notice to the accused and that the application for restoration was liable to be dismissed on this ground as well. 

The court also observed that the Board had not complied with the provisions of Section 33A of the Act, which require the Board to file an application for restoration within a period of three months from the date of the order. The court held that the application for restoration was filed after the expiry of the three-month period and was liable to be dismissed on this ground as well. 

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court quashed the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and dismissed the application for restoration filed by the Water Pollution Board. The court held that the proceedings under Section 33 of the Act are criminal in nature and that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to revive and restore the application. The court also held that the Board had not followed the proper procedure for filing the application for restoration and had not shown sufficient cause for its failure to appear on the date of hearing. The court further held that the Board had not complied with the provisions of Section 33 and Section 33A of the Act.
