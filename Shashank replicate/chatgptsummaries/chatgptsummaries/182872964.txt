The Madras High Court recently heard four writ petitions challenging provisional orders of attachment passed by the Director of Enforcement, which were later confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The petitioners in the first two writ petitions were the wife and daughter of one Md. Ismail Khan Ghori, against whom a complaint was registered for alleged offences under Section 420 read with Section 511 IPC and Sections 4 and 5 of Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978. The petitioners in the third and fourth writ petitions were the mother of one S.Anbu, who was implicated along with one Mr.Amarchand Kothari and a few others in a criminal complaint.

The main grounds on which the petitioners in all these writ petitions assail the impugned orders are that the orders were passed in violation of the principles of natural justice and without providing adequate opportunity of being heard, and that without deciding the question of independent ownership of the properties, the respondents have attached the properties owned by the family members of the accused. However, the court rejected the contentions of the petitioners and dismissed the writ petitions.

The court order discusses the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and its impact on the rights of persons charged under the Act, as well as the rights of children and women who may be affected by the Act. The court notes that the Act not only seeks to punish offenders but also seeks to punish victims of such offenses. The court also highlights the lacuna in the Act, particularly in the schedule, which covers only certain offenses. The court discusses the validity of Sections 8(4) and 8(6) read with Section 9 and the relevant paragraphs of Part A and B of the schedule to the Act, and notes that the Andhra Pradesh High Court has not tested their validity from the point of view of their impact upon the victims of a crime. The court also examines Section 5 and Section 8 of the Act in their entirety.

The court upholds the validity of Section 8(4) of the Act, which allows for the dispossessing of a person in possession of the proceeds of crime or the property acquired from out of the proceeds of crime, even before the conviction of the accused. However, the court expresses doubts about the manner in which Section 8(4) has been understood and its potential impact on the rights of persons entirely unconnected with the crime.

The court order pertains to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. It outlines the process for provisional attachment of property by the Director or any other Officer, and the subsequent filing of a complaint before the Adjudicating Authority. The Authority is required to serve notice to the person against whom the complaint is made, and after considering all relevant materials, pass an order confirming the attachment if the property is found to be involved in money laundering. The order of attachment goes through three stages - provisional, confirmation, and finality. The Director is empowered to take possession of the attached property only after the order of attachment attains finality.

The expression "possession" used in Section 8(4) is subject to different interpretations, and the Court must consider the broader Constitutional scheme while interpreting the statute. The right to property is a Constitutional and human right, and the Court must ensure that the interpretation of the statute does not violate this right. The court concludes that the expression "possession" cannot be understood to mean actual physical possession, as it would infringe upon the human and constitutional rights of the accused, victims, and third parties who are in possession of such properties.

The court allows the writ petitions to a limited extent, confirming all other portions of the impugned orders of the Deputy Director and the Adjudicating Authority, except the portion relating to actual physical possession. The respondents are directed to put the petitioners back into possession of the properties, but the legal and constructive possession of the properties shall remain with the Deputy Director/Director, and the petitioners cannot alienate, encumber, or part with possession of the properties until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against the accused and until the conclusion of the confiscation proceedings that may be taken up after the decision of the Criminal Courts.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard four writ petitions challenging provisional orders of attachment passed by the Director of Enforcement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The court rejected the contentions of the petitioners and dismissed the writ petitions. However, the court expressed doubts about the manner in which Section 8(4) has been understood and its potential impact on the rights of persons entirely unconnected with the crime. The court concluded that the expression "possession" cannot be understood to mean actual physical possession, as it would infringe upon the human and constitutional rights of the accused, victims, and third parties who are in possession of such properties. The court allowed the writ petitions to a limited extent, confirming all other portions of the impugned orders of the Deputy Director and the Adjudicating Authority, except the portion relating to actual physical possession.
