The first court order pertains to a criminal writ petition filed by Ashok Pratap Rai against the State of U.P. and three others. The petitioner sought to quash an FIR lodged against him under Sections 195, 500, 501, and 120-B IPC. The petitioner's counsel argued that the allegations made in the FIR did not disclose an offense under Section 195 IPC against the petitioner. The counsel also argued that the prosecution of the petitioner under Sections 500, 501, and 120-B IPC was barred by Section 199 Cr.P.C. 

The court examined the allegations made in the FIR and found that they did not disclose an offense under Section 195 IPC against the petitioner. The court also found that the prosecution of the petitioner under Sections 500 and 501 IPC pursuant to the impugned FIR was bad in law in view of Section 199 (1) Cr.P.C. Therefore, the court quashed the impugned FIR dated 07.10.2015 registered as case crime no. 1339 of 2015 under Sections 195, 500, 501 and 120-B IPC. However, the order does not preclude the respondent no.4 from pursuing the remedy available to him under the law of land for proceeding against the petitioner for having allegedly committed the offenses under Sections 500 and 501 IPC.

The second court order states that the allegations made in the FIR do not disclose the offense punishable under Section 195 IPC. The court examines the definition of the word "evidence" and concludes that the statement given by the petitioner during a television show does not constitute evidence within the meaning of the word "evidence" as defined in Section 3 of the Evidence Act. Therefore, the allegations made in the FIR do not disclose the ingredients of the offense under Section 195 IPC. The court quashes the impugned FIR dated 07.10.2015 registered as case crime no. 1339 of 2015 under Sections 195, 500, 501 and 120-B IPC. However, the order does not preclude the respondent no.4 from pursuing the remedy available to him under the law of land for proceeding against the petitioner for having allegedly committed the offenses under Sections 500 and 501 IPC.

In summary, both court orders pertain to a criminal writ petition filed by Ashok Pratap Rai against the State of U.P. and three others. The petitioner sought to quash an FIR lodged against him under Sections 195, 500, 501, and 120-B IPC. The court examined the allegations made in the FIR and found that they did not disclose an offense under Section 195 IPC against the petitioner. The court also found that the prosecution of the petitioner under Sections 500 and 501 IPC pursuant to the impugned FIR was bad in law in view of Section 199 (1) Cr.P.C. Therefore, the court quashed the impugned FIR. However, the order does not preclude the respondent no.4 from pursuing the remedy available to him under the law of land for proceeding against the petitioner for having allegedly committed the offenses under Sections 500 and 501 IPC.
