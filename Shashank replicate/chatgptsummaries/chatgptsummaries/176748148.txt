Jaiveer, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.2, Badi, Dholpur, which refused to release his tractor and trolley. The tractor and trolley were seized as case property in FIR No.33/2018, registered at Police Station Basaidang, Dholpur, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29/51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Section 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act.

The petitioner contended that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the alleged offences and were seized only on the ground that they were used for transporting the stolen wood. The petitioner further submitted that the tractor and trolley were his only source of livelihood and their detention was causing him immense hardship.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, imposing certain conditions. The petitioner shall keep the vehicle and trolley intact and shall not change their identification, produce the vehicle and trolley as and when trial court requires the same for proposed identification of the case property, execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court, and the trial court is empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit.

In another case, the petitioner, Rakesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC at Police Station Kotwali, District Bijnor. The petitioner contended that the allegations made in the FIR were false and baseless and were made with a view to harass him.

The court observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further observed that the allegations made in the FIR were not so absurd and inherently improbable that no prudent person could ever reach such a conclusion. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the investigating agency to complete the investigation within a period of three months.

In yet another case, the petitioner, Rajesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to quash the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, whereby the petitioner's application for discharge was rejected. The petitioner was accused of committing offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC.

The court observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court further observed that the material on record prima facie indicated the involvement of the petitioner in the commission of the alleged offences. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the trial court to proceed with the trial in accordance with law.

In conclusion, the courts have taken a balanced approach in these cases. While in the first case, the court allowed the release of the tractor and trolley, imposing certain conditions, in the second and third cases, the courts observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The courts, therefore, directed the investigating agency to complete the investigation within a period of three months and directed the trial court to proceed with the trial in accordance with law. These cases highlight the importance of a fair and impartial investigation and trial process in ensuring justice for all.
