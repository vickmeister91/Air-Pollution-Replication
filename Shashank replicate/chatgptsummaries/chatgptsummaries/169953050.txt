The Gujarat High Court recently issued directions to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to periodically inspect fishing industries operating in Veraval, draw samples to ensure they meet pollution control parameters, and inspect the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plant. The court also directed the Veraval Industries Association to rectify deficiencies in the functioning of the RO plant within three weeks. The court closed the public interest litigation and did not award any costs.

The court's decision came after a public interest litigation was filed by an environmental activist, alleging that the fishing industries in Veraval were discharging untreated effluent into the sea, causing harm to marine life and the environment. The petitioner also alleged that the CETP and RO plant, which were set up to treat the effluent, were not functioning properly.

During the hearing, the GPCB submitted a report stating that it had conducted inspections of the fishing industries and found that some of them were not complying with pollution control norms. The report also stated that the CETP and RO plant were not functioning properly and needed to be repaired.

The Veraval Industries Association, which represents the fishing industries in the area, submitted an affidavit stating that it had taken steps to rectify the deficiencies in the RO plant and that it would ensure that the plant was functioning properly within three weeks.

After considering the submissions of all parties, the court issued directions to the GPCB to periodically inspect the fishing industries and draw samples to ensure they meet pollution control parameters. The court also directed the GPCB to inspect the CETP and RO plant to ensure they were functioning properly.

The court further directed the Veraval Industries Association to rectify the deficiencies in the RO plant within three weeks and to ensure that the plant was functioning properly. The court closed the public interest litigation and did not award any costs.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of enforcing pollution control norms and ensuring that industries comply with them. The court's directions to the GPCB to periodically inspect the fishing industries and draw samples to ensure they meet pollution control parameters will help to prevent further harm to the environment and marine life.

The court's direction to the Veraval Industries Association to rectify the deficiencies in the RO plant within three weeks is also significant as it shows that the court is serious about ensuring that industries comply with pollution control norms and that they take steps to rectify any deficiencies in their treatment plants.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that industries comply with pollution control norms. It is hoped that the GPCB and the Veraval Industries Association will take the court's directions seriously and take steps to ensure that the fishing industries in Veraval operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.
