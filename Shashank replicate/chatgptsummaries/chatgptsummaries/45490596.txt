This section empowers the court to require any person to produce any document or thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Cr.P.C., or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.
