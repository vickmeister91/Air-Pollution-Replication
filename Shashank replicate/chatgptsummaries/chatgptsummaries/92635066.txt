The Madras High Court recently heard two writ appeals against an order made in W.P.No.24003 of 2014. The appeals were made by the fifth respondent and the 1st, 2nd, and 4th respondents, respectively. The appeals questioned the legality, validity, and propriety of the order. The fifth respondent was accused of committing irregularities while working as Chief Environment Engineer, Chennai. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board found five of the seven charges against him to be true, resulting in a loss of Rs.4,95,709/- to the exchequer. The fifth respondent was appointed as Member Secretary by the Environment and Forest (EC2) Department on 25.7.2014. The petitioner filed the writ petition on 1st September 2014, seeking a writ in the nature of Writ of Quo Warranto or any other appropriate writ to declare the appointment of the fifth respondent as against the authority of law and consequently to declare the post of Member Secretary as vacant.

The court considered all aspects of the matter and observed that the eligibility of the petitioner for appointment to the post of Member Secretary was not in doubt. The court also noted that the government did not have the benefit of the draft final report of the Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption during the period from 21.7.2014, the date on which the Note File was generated, until 25.7.2014, the date on which the appointment was approved. The court order pertains to the appointment of the fifth respondent as Member Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The court examines the issue of eligibility and suitability of the candidate, given the pending disciplinary proceedings against him. The court finds that the charges against the candidate were serious and had been proved in the departmental enquiry. The court holds that integrity is an essential part of eligibility and suitability, and the institutional integrity is also a relevant consideration. The court concludes that the appointment of the fifth respondent was vitiated due to the inherent defect in the selection process, and the writ petition seeking quo warranto is allowed.

The court order discusses the scope of judicial review for grant of quo warranto in cases of appointment of public officials. The court can only examine eligibility or violation of statutory or constitutional provisions, not the suitability of a candidate. The appointment can be challenged on the grounds of lack of eligibility or lack of effective consultation. The court cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of the government in the choice of the person to be appointed as long as the person chosen possesses the prescribed qualification and is otherwise eligible for appointment. The court can issue a writ of quo warranto when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules. The appointment can also be challenged on the ground of lack of institutional integrity.

The court order states that judicial review in the case of grant of quo warranto is only permissible to the extent of examining eligibility or violation of statutory/constitutional provisions, not the suitability of a candidate. The case in question is one of lack of eligibility as prescribed under the statute, and the writ court was justified in granting the writ of quo warranto. The court dismisses both writ appeals and states that the impugned order of the learned Single Judge does not suffer from any infirmity, illegality or irregularity, warranting interference.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard two writ appeals against an order made in W.P.No.24003 of 2014.
