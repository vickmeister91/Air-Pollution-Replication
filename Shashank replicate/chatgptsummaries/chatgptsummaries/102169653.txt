The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has issued several orders related to sand mining in the Tamiraparani river basin in Tamil Nadu, India. The court heard petitions from farmers, village panchayats, and political parties, and considered the impact of sand mining on the river's flow, water supply for irrigation and drinking, and the need for scientific sand mining. The Tamiraparani river is considered sacred, and its water is used for drinking, irrigation, and industrial purposes. The court noted the importance of proper infrastructure management and the regulation of water for irrigation.

The court found that sand mining had been conducted beyond the permitted depth and distance, with the use of heavy machinery, causing eco-imbalance and damage to the river's ecosystem. The court ordered that no further sand mining be permitted in the area, and that the quarried sites be re-dumped or re-filled. The court also noted the impact of sand mining on the river's physical, water quality, and ecological aspects, including degradation of riparian habitat, flora, and fauna.

The court appointed a commission to inspect the sand quarrying sites and file a report on the extent of quarrying, its impact on public interest, ayacutdars, drinking water, and the ecological system. The commission found that sand quarrying had altered the eco-system in all five sites and recommended remedial measures. The court also referred to relevant provisions of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules regarding the use of machinery for quarrying sand from river beds.

The court discussed the issue of sand quarrying in the Tamiraparani river in Tamil Nadu. The government had granted permission to the Public Works Department to operate sand quarries in the state, but with certain conditions and regulations. However, there have been allegations of illegal sand quarrying using machinery, which has affected the ecology and water flow of the river. The court has ordered a monitoring committee to be constituted to oversee sand quarrying and ensure compliance with regulations. The court has also noted excessive sand quarrying in all five sites involved and has called for a balance between the need for sand and ecological concerns.

The court discussed five different sites where sand mining has taken place. In Tholappanpannai, mining has exceeded the permitted length and a motorable road has been constructed inside the river. Floodplain mining has resulted in loss of habitats for fishes and cutting off the original course of the river. In Kizhpidagai Appankovil, quarrying has been done along the southern bank and a pool has been formed inside the river bed. In Mukkani, quarrying has been done on substantial portions along the north and well into the bed. In Mangalakurichi, sand mining has taken place about the flood line and river bed on the east, which has altered the course of the river flow. The court orders a ban on sand/gravel mining/quarrying for five years in all five sites due to the ecological imbalance created by sand mining and the need to restore the natural condition of the river.

The court emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and responsible utilization of natural resources, particularly in the context of sand quarrying. The court cites the principle of public trust, which holds that natural resources are not only meant for the present generation but should be preserved for future generations. The court also refers to the doctrine of sustainable development, which aims to balance economic and social needs with environmental considerations. The court orders that sand quarrying must be conducted in a responsible manner, with consideration for the dynamic of the river and the potential ecological damage caused by excessive quarrying. The court also cites previous Supreme Court decisions that emphasize the importance of conserving natural resources and protecting the environment.

The court prohibits sand mining/quarrying in the entire stretch of Tamiraparani river for five years due to excessive unscientific sand quarrying beyond the sanctioned limit, which has affected the flow of water and river's eco-system. The court also directs the rehabilitation of the area and the formation of a monitoring committee for all the rivers in the State of Tamil Nadu to ensure scientific sand quarrying in accordance with TN MMC Rules. The District Collectors are the competent authorities to grant permission to the Public Works Department to quarry sand, and the inspecting team shall prepare a report focusing on environmental issues. The court also emphasizes the need to strike a balance between the requirement and the preservation of rivers.

The court states that District Collectors are responsible for granting permission to the Public Works Department to quarry sand. A team of experts must inspect the site and submit a report on environmental impacts before permission is granted. The quarrying operation must strictly follow TN MMC Rules and be monitored by a State Level Monitoring Committee. The use of heavy machinery is prohibited, and loading contractors must follow strict accounting procedures. Any grievances about illegal or excessive quarrying can be brought to the attention of the Committee. The Registrar Judicial is directed to finalize the names of the Committee members.

In summary, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has issued several orders related to sand mining in the Tamiraparani river basin in Tamil Nadu, India. The court has considered the impact of sand mining on the river's flow, water supply for irrigation and drinking, and the need for scientific sand mining. The court has ordered a ban on sand/gravel mining/quarrying for five years in all five sites due to the ecological imbalance created by sand
