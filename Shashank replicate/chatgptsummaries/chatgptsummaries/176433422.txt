The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by R. Usha Rani against the Kodaikanal Municipality and TANGEDCO regarding an impugned notice issued under Sections 217 (E) (2) of the Tamilnadu District Municipalities Act. The petitioner had obtained permission for a residential building, but had constructed a commercial building instead. The court found that there was no scope for interfering with the impugned order, as the petitioner had violated the terms of the permission granted. However, the court permitted the petitioner to submit a fresh application to the authority concerned, subject to the new master plan and planning and building norms.

The court order emphasizes the importance of adhering to planning and building norms, and ensuring that constructions are in tune and conformity with the planning norms. The authorities have been directed to ensure that the petitioner's building is in consonance with every rule and law of the land. This is a significant ruling, as it underscores the need for strict adherence to planning and building norms, and the consequences of violating the terms of permission granted.

The court has also directed that the petitioner's application shall be disposed of on merits and in accordance with law within a period of six months. This is a welcome move, as it ensures that the petitioner's application will be considered in a timely manner, and that justice will be served. The court has also made it clear that the authorities must ensure that the petitioner's building is in conformity with every rule and law of the land, which is a positive step towards ensuring that constructions are in line with planning and building norms.
