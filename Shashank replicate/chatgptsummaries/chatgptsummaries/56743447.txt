The Jammu & Kashmir High Court recently issued a ruling in a case involving M/s J.K. Polethene, a company that was found to be manufacturing polythene carry bags and allied products of less than fifty microns without the necessary consent to establish and operate from respondent No.3. The court allowed an application filed by the company seeking an extension of time for affixing requisite court fee and affidavits, but dismissed the petitioner's challenge to the validity of an order passed by respondent No.3, which directed the petitioner-unit to be closed and sealed.

The court held that the impugned order was legal and did not call for any interference. However, the petitioner can apply to respondent No.3 seeking requisite clearance for running its activity of manufacturing of polythene carry bags above 50 microns in thickness. This ruling has significant implications for companies operating in the polythene carry bag industry in Jammu & Kashmir.

The case began when respondent No.3, the government authority responsible for regulating the manufacture of polythene carry bags and allied products in Jammu & Kashmir, discovered that M/s J.K. Polethene was manufacturing such products without the necessary consent to establish and operate. Respondent No.3 subsequently issued an order directing the petitioner-unit to be closed and sealed.

M/s J.K. Polethene challenged the validity of this order in court, arguing that it was illegal and arbitrary. The company also sought an extension of time for affixing requisite court fee and affidavits. The court allowed the latter application, but dismissed the former.

The court held that the impugned order was legal and did not call for any interference. The court noted that the manufacture of polythene carry bags and allied products of less than fifty microns without the necessary consent to establish and operate is prohibited under the Jammu & Kashmir Control of Polythene Carry Bags (Manufacture, Sales and Usage) Order, 2017. The court also noted that the impugned order was issued in accordance with the provisions of this order.

The court further held that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that the impugned order was arbitrary or illegal. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary consent to establish and operate, and had therefore violated the law. The court also noted that the impugned order was issued after giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

However, the court did leave open the possibility for the petitioner to apply to respondent No.3 seeking requisite clearance for running its activity of manufacturing of polythene carry bags above 50 microns in thickness. This suggests that the court is open to the possibility of the petitioner being allowed to operate in the future, provided that it obtains the necessary clearance from the relevant government authority.

Overall, this ruling has significant implications for companies operating in the polythene carry bag industry in Jammu & Kashmir. It underscores the importance of obtaining the necessary consent to establish and operate, and highlights the potential consequences of failing to do so. It also suggests that companies may be able to continue operating in the future if they obtain the necessary clearance from the relevant government authority.
