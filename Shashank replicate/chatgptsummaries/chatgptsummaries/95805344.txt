The court orders pertain to two separate civil suits involving damages caused to orchid plants due to water stagnation caused by the deliberate blocking of drainage by the defendants. In the first case, P.P. Mathew filed a lawsuit against Mahendra World City Developers for damages caused to his orchid plants due to the defendant's alleged deliberate blocking of drainage and flooding of the area. Mathew had purchased the plants in a court auction sale and faced several litigations and delays in obtaining possession and shifting them to a new location.

The court examined evidence and witness testimonies and framed several issues for consideration, including whether Mathew was entitled to compensation for damages and whether the defendant had caused any loss or damages. The court also considered the defendant's contention that Mathew had not come with clean hands and was at fault for occupying acquired lands and not taking action to remove the plants.

After considering all the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, the court held that Mathew was entitled to compensation for damages caused to his orchid plants. The court found that the defendant had deliberately blocked the drainage and caused water stagnation, which had resulted in the damage to Mathew's plants. The court also rejected the defendant's contention that Mathew had not come with clean hands and was at fault for occupying acquired lands and not taking action to remove the plants.

In the second case, the plaintiff claimed damages from the defendant for the loss of 32,000 orchid plants due to water stagnation caused by the defendant's deliberate blocking of drainage. The court found that the plaintiff had no evidence to support the number of plants destroyed, their value, or the actual damage caused. The court also noted that the plaintiff had squatted on the property with the aid of court orders and had caused hardship to the defendant.

After considering all the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, the court dismissed the suit with costs. The court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove the damages claimed and had caused hardship to the defendant by squatting on the property with the aid of court orders.

In both cases, the court examined the evidence and witness testimonies presented by both parties and framed several issues for consideration. The court also considered the contentions of both parties and made its decision based on the evidence presented. While the court held in favor of the plaintiff in the first case, it dismissed the suit in the second case due to lack of evidence to support the damages claimed.

These court orders highlight the importance of presenting strong evidence to support claims in civil suits. It is also important for parties to come with clean hands and not engage in any illegal or unethical activities that may harm the other party. The court's decision in these cases serves as a reminder that justice is served based on the evidence presented and the law, and parties must abide by the court's decision.
