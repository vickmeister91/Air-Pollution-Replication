In a recent court order, a petitioner filed a criminal original petition to direct the second respondent not to harass him. However, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the petition was not maintainable as the petitioner did not appear for enquiry before the respondent police. The court directed the petitioner to appear before the respondent police for enquiry along with relevant documents and dismissed the criminal original petition. However, the respondent police were instructed not to harass the petitioner under the guise of enquiry.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief from alleged harassment by the respondent police. However, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the petition was not maintainable as the petitioner had not appeared for enquiry before the respondent police. The court agreed with this argument and directed the petitioner to appear before the respondent police for enquiry along with relevant documents.

The court's decision to dismiss the criminal original petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had not followed the proper procedure for seeking relief from alleged harassment. The court emphasized the importance of following proper legal procedures and directed the petitioner to comply with the respondent police's request for an enquiry.

However, the court also recognized the potential for abuse of power by the respondent police and instructed them not to harass the petitioner under the guise of enquiry. This was an important safeguard to ensure that the petitioner's rights were protected during the enquiry process.

Overall, the court's decision was a balanced one that recognized the importance of following proper legal procedures while also protecting the petitioner's rights from potential abuse of power by the respondent police. The court's instruction to the respondent police not to harass the petitioner under the guise of enquiry was an important safeguard that ensured the petitioner's rights were protected during the enquiry process.
