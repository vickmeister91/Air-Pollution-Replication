The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by 10 marble traders against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The traders had sought to quash a demand raised by the DDA for alternative plots allotted to them at a rate of Rs. 38,259/- per sq. m. The traders argued that they were entitled to the same rate of Rs. 5200/- per sq. m. as other similarly situated marble traders.

The court found that the DDA had conceded that the petitioners would be allotted the alternative plots on the "same parameters" as the 94 persons who had been allotted plots in 1997. The court held that the DDA was not entitled to charge a rate higher than Rs. 5200/- per sq. m. and quashed the demand letters.

The judgment is significant as it upholds the principle of equality before the law. The court has held that similarly situated persons should be treated equally and that the DDA cannot charge different rates to different persons for the same service. This is a welcome development as it ensures that the government agencies are held accountable for their actions and that they cannot act arbitrarily.

The court has also emphasized the importance of transparency in the functioning of government agencies. The DDA had failed to provide any justification for charging a higher rate to the petitioners. The court has held that the DDA must provide reasons for its actions and that it cannot act in an arbitrary manner.

The judgment is also significant as it protects the rights of the petitioners. The traders had argued that they were entitled to the same rate as other similarly situated traders. The court has upheld their right to be treated equally and has quashed the demand letters. This ensures that the petitioners are not unfairly burdened with a higher rate and that their rights are protected.

Overall, the judgment is a positive development as it upholds the principles of equality, transparency, and accountability. It ensures that government agencies are held accountable for their actions and that the rights of citizens are protected. The judgment is a reminder that the government must act in a fair and transparent manner and that it cannot act arbitrarily.
