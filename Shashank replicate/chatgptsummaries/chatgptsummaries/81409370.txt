The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Dharmendra Singh, who was accused of offenses under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court heard arguments from both sides before making its decision. Singh's counsel argued that his client was not involved in any illegal activity and had no criminal antecedents.

After considering the arguments from both sides, the court granted anticipatory bail to Singh. The court ordered his release upon his surrender or arrest within 12 weeks, subject to certain conditions.
