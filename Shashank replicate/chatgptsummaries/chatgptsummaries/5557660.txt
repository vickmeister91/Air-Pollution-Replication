The Supreme Court of India recently heard and consolidated three appeals related to a dispute between the State of Rajasthan and the Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology over the change in the scheme for giving retiral benefits to employees. The University had given its employees the option to either continue with the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme or opt for a pension scheme under the Pension Rules, 1990. However, the University did not consult with the State of Rajasthan before making this change, which violated the provisions of Section 39 of the Rajasthan Agricultural University, Udaipur Act, 2000.

The State of Rajasthan argued that the resolutions passed by the University were invalid and that the burden of payment of pension to the employees would ultimately fall on the State. The State also contended that the University should have taken the consent of the Chancellor before changing the policy, as the State provides substantial financial assistance to the University. The High Court of Rajasthan had earlier ruled in favor of the University, but the State of Rajasthan appealed the judgment.

The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and heard all the appeals together. The court found that the University did not obtain necessary assent from the Chancellor before effecting the change in the scheme, and therefore, the order passed by the State of Rajasthan quashing the resolutions passed by the University was legal. The court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the High Court, directing that the employees shall be given retiral benefits as per the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme which was in force prior to December 7, 2000.

The court order pertains to multiple appeals (with reference numbers provided) that were heard on September 23, 2013. The petitioner(s) and respondent(s) were represented by various lawyers. The judgment was pronounced by Justice Anil R. Dave, on behalf of a bench comprising Justice Dipak Misra and himself. The appeals were allowed in accordance with the signed reportable judgment, which is placed on file.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining necessary approvals before making changes to policies and schemes. It also emphasizes the need for consultation and collaboration between institutions and the State in matters related to financial assistance and burden-sharing. The court's decision ensures that the employees of the University receive their retiral benefits as per the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, which was in force prior to the change made by the University.
