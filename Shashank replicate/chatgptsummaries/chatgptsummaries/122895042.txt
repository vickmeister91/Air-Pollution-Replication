Two individuals, Sheikh Muzaffar Hussain and Abdul Mannan, were convicted by a court for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by possessing Indian Soft Shelled Turtles, which are specified in Schedule-I of the Act. The turtles were recovered during a raid conducted by the police on a complaint from a PFA activist. The accused pleaded not guilty, but the prosecution provided evidence from witnesses and relevant provisions of the Act to prove their guilt. The court ordered their conviction on 30 March 2013.

The court order states that two accused individuals have been found guilty of possessing four Indian Soft shelled turtles without a license or authority, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The prosecution argued that the witnesses identified the accused and the recovered turtles correctly, while the defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove its case and did not produce the case property in court. The court found the prosecution's evidence to be credible and convicted the accused under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The judgment was announced in open court and will be sent to the Delhi District Court website.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, or capturing of any wild animal, including turtles, without a license or authority. The Indian Soft Shelled Turtle is a species of freshwater turtle found in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. It is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.

In the case of Sheikh Muzaffar Hussain and Abdul Mannan, the court found them guilty of possessing Indian Soft Shelled Turtles without a license or authority, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The turtles were recovered during a raid conducted by the police on a complaint from a PFA activist. The prosecution provided evidence from witnesses and relevant provisions of the Act to prove their guilt, while the defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove its case and did not produce the case property in court.

The court found the prosecution's evidence to be credible and convicted the accused under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The judgment was announced in open court and will be sent to the Delhi District Court website. The court's decision sends a strong message that the illegal trade in wildlife will not be tolerated and that those who violate the law will be held accountable.

The illegal trade in wildlife is a global problem that threatens the survival of many species. It is estimated that the illegal wildlife trade is worth billions of dollars annually and is one of the most profitable criminal activities in the world. The trade in turtles is particularly lucrative, as they are in high demand for their meat, shells, and as pets.

The Indian Soft Shelled Turtle is a species that is particularly vulnerable to the illegal wildlife trade. The turtles are often captured from the wild and sold in markets or exported to other countries. The trade in Indian Soft Shelled Turtles is illegal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and those who are caught violating the law can face severe penalties.

The conviction of Sheikh Muzaffar Hussain and Abdul Mannan sends a strong message that the illegal trade in wildlife will not be tolerated in India. The court's decision is a victory for wildlife conservation and a reminder that the law will be enforced to protect endangered species. It is hoped that this case will serve as a deterrent to others who may be involved in the illegal trade in wildlife and that it will help to raise awareness about the importance of protecting endangered species.
