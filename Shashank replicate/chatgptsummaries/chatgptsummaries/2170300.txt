The Karnataka High Court recently received two writ petitions from stone crushing companies against the State of Karnataka, the Department of Mines and Geology, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and other government officials. The first petition sought to quash closure notices issued by the respondents under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioners argued that they were valid licensees to run stone crushing units and that the closure notices were unjustified. The second petition sought permission to operate stone crushing units and a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider their applications to operate their crushing units.

In the first case, the court ordered that the petitioners were indeed licensees and that the closure notices should be quashed. The petitioners argued that they had obtained all necessary licenses and permits to operate their stone crushing units and that the closure notices were issued without any basis. The respondents argued that the stone crushing units were causing air pollution and that the closure notices were issued to protect the environment and public health. The court noted that the petitioners had obtained all necessary licenses and permits to operate their stone crushing units and that the closure notices were issued without any basis. The court ordered that the closure notices should be quashed and that the petitioners should be allowed to continue their stone crushing activity.

In the second case, the court noted that this writ action was similar to a previous case where the Division Bench quashed the closure notice issued by the Pollution Control Board and allowed the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. The court quashed the orders impugned in the writ petition and allowed the operation of the stone crushing units of the petitioners at the present site till such time their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from now.

The court's decision in both cases is significant as it upholds the rights of stone crushing companies to operate their businesses within the framework of the law. The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary licenses and permits before starting any business activity. The court's decision also underscores the need for government agencies to follow due process and provide a fair hearing to all parties before taking any action that affects their rights and interests.

The court's decision in the first case is particularly important as it addresses the issue of air pollution caused by stone crushing units. The court's decision recognizes the importance of protecting the environment and public health but also emphasizes the need to balance these concerns with the rights of businesses to operate within the framework of the law. The court's decision in the second case is also significant as it allows the petitioners to continue their stone crushing activity while their applications are being considered by the licensing authority.

In conclusion, the court's decision in both cases is a welcome development for stone crushing companies in Karnataka. The court's decision upholds their rights to operate their businesses within the framework of the law and provides a fair hearing to all parties before taking any action that affects their rights and interests. The court's decision also recognizes the importance of protecting the environment and public health but emphasizes the need to balance these concerns with the rights of businesses to operate within the framework of the law.
