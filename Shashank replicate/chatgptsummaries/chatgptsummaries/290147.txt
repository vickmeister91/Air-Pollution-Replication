The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the construction of a thermal power plant in Nandikur, Karnataka, and the concerns raised by various parties regarding its potential impact on the environment and local communities.

One court order, filed by Jana Jagruthi Samithi, argues that the land proposed to be acquired for the power plant is not almost free from habitation, as stated in the feasibility report, and that no clearance has been obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forests for the acquisition of lands. The petitioners also argue that no scheme has been prepared for rehabilitating the people likely to be displaced due to the acquisition of lands. The respondent, NTPC, argues that the project has been cleared by various authorities and that there is an urgent need to establish the power station due to acute power shortage in the state. The respondent also argues that the project has received cooperation and aid credit from USSR for its implementation.

Another court order discusses a petition opposing the location of the power project due to concerns about environmental pollution and health hazards. The respondent argues that all necessary precautions have been taken and that the project is time-bound and included in an agreement between the governments of India and the USSR. The court emphasizes the importance of maintaining ecological balance and cites previous cases on environmental protection. Ultimately, the court does not find merit in the petition and dismisses it.

The court also discusses the government's responsibility to balance economic development with environmental concerns when approving projects. The court suggests the creation of a High Powered Authority to oversee hazardous industries and ensure safety standards are met. The order also references an agreement between India and the USSR for the construction of a thermal power plant, which includes a time schedule for completion and repayment. The court notes that the project was included in the VIII Five Year Plan and had received clearance from various committees and boards. The court ultimately concludes that the project can proceed with certain conditions and requirements for environmental and pollution control.

In another court order, it is stated that an industry cannot be commissioned for trial or regular production unless the effluent treatment plant is completed and necessary air pollution control equipment is installed to the satisfaction of the Board. The industry must also establish an environmental management cell for regular monitoring of air emissions and water quality. The order also requires the industry to furnish a detailed program of work for pollution control and inform the Board of the exact date of commissioning of the plant. The court order also mentions a separate consent of the Board for discharge of liquid effluent and atmospheric emissions that must be obtained before proceeding with trial production. Another communication from the Secretary to Government of Karnataka, Department of Ecology & Environment, grants environmental clearance to a proposed Super Thermal Power Project subject to certain conditions, including ash disposal, pollution control, coal handling, zoning, land use, monitoring, and rehabilitation. The NTPC responds to a query from the Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the location of the ash pond and ash utilization, stating that the proposed alternate sites are unsuitable and that the construction of an ash bund or pond could be used for reclamation of sea by making suitable ash dyke in the sea and disposing ash.

The court order also pertains to the construction of an ash bund or pond for the reclamation of the sea by making a suitable ash dyke in the sea and disposing of ash, which is a well-established system prevalent all over the world. The court has considered alternative sites for the location of the ash pond but has found that the proposed site at Yellur is the only suitable option. The order also outlines the environmental and pollution control measures that will be taken by the project. The court has noted that there is no reserved forest land involved in this case.

Another court order discusses various thermal power projects and their stages of completion or execution. It also mentions the extent of land acquired for these projects and the precautions taken to prevent environmental pollution. The order refers to documents relied on by both parties in the case, including expert reports and government clearances for the projects. The order concludes that the proposed thermal power plant at Nandikur is necessary to address power shortages in Karnataka and that the site selection was done after detailed studies and environmental assessments.

The court order outlines the fly ash removal system, flue gas handling, and environmental effects of a proposed thermal power plant in Nandikur. The order discusses the disposal of fly ash and the potential impact on aquatic life, as well as the measures taken to control air and water pollution. The order also addresses the impact on local communities and the need for rehabilitation and resettlement schemes. The order concludes with guidelines for development in coastal areas and the economics of pollution control.

Finally, the court order discusses the conditions and requirements for the construction of a thermal power plant in Nandikur, including the need for approval from the Committee on Conservation of Sea Shores for any structures within 500 meters of the sea-coast. The order also outlines the budget and equipment needed for pollution control and monitoring, as well as emergency planning measures. The order considers alternative methods for ash disposal, ultimately recommending the construction of ash dykes to contain pollutants. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petitions, finding no violation of fundamental rights.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complex and often contentious issues surrounding the construction of large-scale industrial projects in India, particularly in areas where there are concerns about environmental pollution and the displacement of local communities. While the courts have generally allowed the Nandikur thermal
