The case involved allegations of theft, illegal possession, and violation of pollution laws. The petitioners, Lalit Kumar Singh and Jay Kumar Singh, were accused of stealing sand from the banks of the Ganges river and transporting it illegally. The police had registered a case against them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Environment Protection Act.

The petitioners had approached the Patna High Court seeking anticipatory bail, claiming that they were innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. They argued that they were poor drivers who had no connection with the loading of sand and that they had been hired by someone else to transport the sand.

The court noted that the petitioners had no criminal antecedents and that they had cooperated with the investigation. The court also observed that the allegations against the petitioners were not of a serious nature and that they were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court ordered the petitioners to furnish bail bonds of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners, including that they should cooperate with the investigation, not leave the country without the court's permission, and not commit any offence while on bail.

The court further ordered that if the petitioners surrendered or were arrested within four weeks of the order, they should be released on bail. However, if they failed to surrender or were not arrested within four weeks, the bail order would stand cancelled.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court granted anticipatory bail to Lalit Kumar Singh and Jay Kumar Singh in connection with a case involving theft, illegal possession, and violation of pollution laws. The court ordered their release on bail of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount, subject to certain conditions, if they surrender or are arrested within four weeks of the order.
