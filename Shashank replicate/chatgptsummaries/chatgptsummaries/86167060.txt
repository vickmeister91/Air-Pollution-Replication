The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Bagh Singh and Iqubal Singh against the State of Rajasthan and various water resource authorities regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication.

The court issued various directions to the state and pollution control board to inspect the canals, remove inlets discharging filthy substances, and prepare short and long-term schemes to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court also directed the state to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination in the canal and its distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The court directed the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directed the State to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court ordered the District Collector to be present on the next hearing and warned that a cost of Rs. 50,000 would be imposed if the State failed to submit the plans and action report.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose the number of encroachers who had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Sriganganagar, Superintendent of Police, Sriganganagar, Commissioner, Municipal Council, Sriganganagar, and the Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was also directed to issue notice to the persons who were contributing to the pollution as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The court further directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of water bodies in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and records relevant to the proceedings. The court has also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over civil cases related to environmental protection. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that a writ court may deviate from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the court if the inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. However, it is within the discretion of the court to insist on alternative remedies if they are efficacious. In this case, the original applicant's cause is within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and the tribunal possesses ample power to condone the delay in filing the application within the prescribed limitation. Therefore, the court dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by December 31, 2016, with the liberty to withdraw the writ petition. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until December 31, 2016.
