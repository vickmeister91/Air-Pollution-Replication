The case in question involves a petitioner who requested that the Return of Income Tax of the complainant be called to determine whether the amount allegedly advanced by two individuals was actually available with them or not. The trial court disallowed the application, and this decision was affirmed by the revisional court. The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C, which was dismissed as it was filed belatedly and did not seem to be bona fide.

The petitioner's request for the Return of Income Tax was made in relation to an alleged advance of funds by two individuals. The petitioner sought to determine whether the funds were actually available with the individuals in question. However, the trial court disallowed the application, and this decision was upheld by the revisional court.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C, which allows for the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. However, this petition was dismissed as it was filed belatedly and did not appear to be bona fide.

The dismissal of the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C was based on the fact that it was filed after a significant amount of time had passed since the original application was disallowed. Additionally, the court found that the petitioner did not appear to have a genuine interest in the matter, and that the petition was filed solely to cause harassment to the complainant.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of filing applications in a timely manner and with a genuine interest in the matter at hand. The court will not tolerate applications that are filed solely to cause harassment or delay, and will dismiss such applications if they are not bona fide.
