The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Santosh Randhawa, who was arrested in connection with a crime under the Chhattisgarh Excise Act. The prosecution's case is that Randhawa was traveling in a car with other co-accused persons when the police intercepted them and seized 172.8 liters of country-made liquor. Randhawa's counsel argued that he was falsely implicated and that similarly placed co-accused persons had already been granted bail. However, the court rejected the bail application, citing Randhawa's previous antecedents and the registration of another crime against him under the same act.

The case highlights the importance of antecedents and previous criminal records in determining bail applications. The court's decision to reject Randhawa's bail application was based on his previous criminal record and the registration of another crime against him under the same act. This indicates that the court takes a serious view of repeat offenders and considers their previous criminal record while deciding on bail applications.

The court's decision also underscores the need for consistency in granting bail. Randhawa's counsel argued that similarly placed co-accused persons had already been granted bail, but the court rejected the argument. This suggests that the court considers each case on its own merits and does not necessarily follow a precedent set in previous cases.

The case also highlights the importance of evidence in determining bail applications. The prosecution's case was based on the seizure of 172.8 liters of country-made liquor from the car in which Randhawa was traveling. This indicates that the court considers the evidence presented by the prosecution while deciding on bail applications.

Overall, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of antecedents, consistency, and evidence in determining bail applications. It also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of their previous criminal record and the potential consequences of repeat offenses.
