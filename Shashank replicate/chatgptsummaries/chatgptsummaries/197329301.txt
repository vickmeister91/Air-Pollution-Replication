The first court order pertains to a case in which the petitioner challenged the proceedings issued by the Chairman of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Chennai. The direction issued by the Chairman was to disconnect the electricity supply for a unit in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 as amended in 1987. This case has a chequered history and this is the third round of litigation before the court. The writ petition filed by the petitioner failed and was dismissed.

The second court order only mentions the location of Madurai and a postal code, and therefore, it is not possible to summarize it based on the given information.

Going into further detail about the first court order, it can be inferred that the petitioner was challenging the decision of the Chairman of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to disconnect the electricity supply for a unit. The Chairman had issued this direction under Section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 as amended in 1987.
