The Karnataka High Court recently received a petition from K. Muniswamy Gowda and another individual against the State of Karnataka and others regarding the rice mill set up by the 8th respondent. The petitioners claimed that the mill was causing health hazards by emitting husk and dust in the surrounding area, violating their fundamental rights and pollution control laws. The Deputy Commissioner had previously granted a permit and license to the 8th respondent, but the petitioners had objected due to the pollution caused by the industry. The Deputy Commissioner had conducted spot inspections and ordered certain measures to be taken, but the pollution persisted. The Deputy Commissioner had initially ordered the industry to be shifted within 30 days, but subsequently altered the condition of shifting. The 8th respondent continued to operate the mill, citing a notification issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Board.

The petitioners argued that the pollution caused by the mill violated their fundamental rights and pollution control laws. The court referred to the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the State Board's functions and power to give directions. The State Government had previously directed the Pollution Board to exempt certain small scale/cottage industries from the purview of the Water and Air Acts. However, the court found this notification to be ultra vires and quashed it. The court also ordered the rice milling industry to obtain consent from the State Pollution Board under Section 21 of the Air Act and pay exemplary damages to the petitioners.

The court order discusses the issue of exempting certain small scale and cottage industries from the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board issued a notification exempting 115 industrial plants, including rice mills, from the Air Act. However, the court found this notification to be ultra vires and quashed it. The court also ordered the rice milling industry to obtain consent from the State Pollution Board under Section 21 of the Air Act and pay exemplary damages to the petitioners.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to pollution control laws and regulations. The court's decision to quash the notification exempting certain small scale and cottage industries from the Water and Air Acts is a step towards ensuring that all industries, regardless of their size, are held accountable for their impact on the environment. The court's decision to order the rice milling industry to obtain consent from the State Pollution Board and pay exemplary damages to the petitioners is a clear message that industries cannot operate at the cost of public health and safety.

The court's decision also highlights the need for stricter enforcement of pollution control laws and regulations. The Deputy Commissioner had previously granted a permit and license to the 8th respondent despite objections from the petitioners. The Deputy Commissioner had conducted spot inspections and ordered certain measures to be taken, but the pollution persisted. The court's decision to order the rice milling industry to obtain consent from the State Pollution Board and pay exemplary damages to the petitioners is a clear message that industries cannot operate at the cost of public health and safety.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of K. Muniswamy Gowda and another individual against the State of Karnataka and others regarding the rice mill set up by the 8th respondent is a significant step towards ensuring that all industries, regardless of their size, are held accountable for their impact on the environment. The court's decision to quash the notification exempting certain small scale and cottage industries from the Water and Air Acts and order the rice milling industry to obtain consent from the State Pollution Board and pay exemplary damages to the petitioners is a clear message that industries cannot operate at the cost of public health and safety. The court's decision also highlights the need for stricter enforcement of pollution control laws and regulations.
