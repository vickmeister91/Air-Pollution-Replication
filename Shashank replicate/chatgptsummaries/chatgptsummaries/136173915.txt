The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Mallikarjun Shenduri seeking to quash an order dated 30.10.2017 on the file of the Prl. Civil Judge and JMFC Court, Sankeshwar in C.C.No.281/2015 and to allow the application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents from PACL India Ltd., Company. The court rejected the petition, stating that the filing of the application by the petitioner is too late and the prayer is not perfectly within the scope of the domain of the case.

The case in question involves a criminal complaint filed against PACL India Ltd. for allegedly cheating investors by promising them land and failing to deliver on that promise. The complaint was filed in 2015 and the case has been ongoing since then. Mallikarjun Shenduri, the petitioner in this case, had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents from PACL India Ltd. The court rejected the petition on the grounds that it was filed too late and that the prayer was not perfectly within the scope of the domain of the case.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing in the possession or control of any person. The section is often used in criminal cases to obtain evidence that is necessary for the prosecution or defense of the case. In this case, Mallikarjun Shenduri had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to obtain documents from PACL India Ltd. that he believed would be relevant to the case.

The court, however, rejected the petition on the grounds that it was filed too late. The court noted that the application was filed after the charges had already been framed in the case and that the petitioner had not given any reason for the delay in filing the application. The court also noted that the prayer in the application was not perfectly within the scope of the domain of the case. The court stated that the documents sought by the petitioner were not directly related to the charges against PACL India Ltd. and that the petitioner had not shown how the documents would be relevant to the case.

The court's decision to reject the petition is significant because it highlights the importance of timely filing of applications under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court noted that the application was filed too late and that the petitioner had not given any reason for the delay. This suggests that courts are likely to be strict in enforcing the time limits for filing such applications. The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that the prayer in the application is perfectly within the scope of the domain of the case. This suggests that petitioners need to be careful in drafting their applications and ensuring that they are relevant to the charges against the accused.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a reminder of the importance of following the procedural requirements in criminal cases. It is important for petitioners to ensure that they file their applications in a timely manner and that the prayer in the application is perfectly within the scope of the domain of the case. Failure to do so can result in the rejection of the application and the loss of an opportunity to obtain important evidence in the case.
