The court order pertains to a case filed by Sh. Nain Singh against the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) seeking payment of his retirement benefits, including gratuity, leave encashment, and arrears. The applicant had worked as an Accounts Officer in the CPCB and had been granted annual increments and promotions during his tenure. However, the CPCB had withdrawn the upgraded pay scale for the post of Accounts Officer, and the applicant's pay was re-fixed accordingly. 

The court heard arguments from both parties and ordered the CPCB to pay the applicant the balance amount of his retirement benefits, including gratuity and leave encashment, based on the emoluments received by him on the date of his retirement. The court found that the applicant was entitled to some gratuity and leave encashment, but not the full amount he had claimed. The court also noted that the applicant's pay had been re-fixed and that he was entitled to some gratuity and leave encashment, but not the full amount he had claimed.

The court examined relevant regulations and rules and found that the approval from the Ministry of Environment & Forests was necessary for the applicant to be entitled to an upgraded pay scale, gratuity, or leave encashment. The court found that the approval was not granted, and therefore, the applicant was not entitled to these benefits. The applicant's claim for these benefits was dismissed, and it was determined that he was not entitled to them.

The court's decision was based on a careful examination of the relevant regulations and rules. The court found that the applicant was entitled to some retirement benefits, but not all of the benefits he had claimed. The court also found that the approval from the Ministry of Environment & Forests was necessary for the applicant to be entitled to certain benefits, and since the approval was not granted, the applicant was not entitled to those benefits.

The court's decision is significant because it highlights the importance of following regulations and rules when it comes to retirement benefits. The court's decision also underscores the need for employees to be aware of their entitlements and to ensure that they receive all the benefits they are entitled to. 

In conclusion, the court order in the case filed by Sh.
