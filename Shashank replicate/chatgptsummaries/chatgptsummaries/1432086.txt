A recent court order has been issued in relation to a dispute between a cement company and a workers' union in Haryana. The workers' union had filed an application to be impleaded as a respondent in a writ petition, seeking modification of an earlier order that had suspended mining and quarrying activities by the company. The workers' union had also requested payment of their full emoluments and protection from retrenchment or removal from service.

The court directed the company to pay the workers their full emoluments till the final orders are passed in the writ petition. However, the company appealed against this order, arguing that it burdens them with financial liability despite a prohibitive order not to carry out any mining activity. The court held that the order is final and appealable. The court also held that the direction for payment of wages could not be issued by the court when the same is already the subject matter of an industrial dispute.

The court further held that workers employed in mining activity are not covered for payment of wages or protection from retrenchment or removal as per the decision of the apex court. This decision was based on the fact that the apex court had previously ruled that workers employed in mining activity are not entitled to payment of wages or protection from retrenchment or removal.

The court order also stated that the court cannot add anything to the judgment of the apex court. Therefore, the workers union or individuals can approach the apex court for necessary direction. The impugned order dated 26.2.1997 is set aside.
