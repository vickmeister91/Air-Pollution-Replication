The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Latha Ramesh, who sought a writ of mandamus directing the authorities to replace all diesel-powered buses in the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) with CNG-powered fuel. The petitioner argued that the use of diesel-powered buses was causing severe air pollution in the city, which was adversely affecting the health of its residents.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court disposed of the writ petition by reserving the right to the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for necessary orders. The court held that the NGT had the jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment was involved, and therefore, it was the appropriate forum to adjudicate the matter.

The court further held that all contentions of the parties were left open to be agitated before the NGT, and there would be no order as to costs. This means that the petitioner can approach the NGT with her plea to replace diesel-powered buses with CNG-powered fuel, and the NGT will have the power to decide the matter based on its merits.

The use of diesel-powered buses has been a contentious issue in Bengaluru for several years now. The city has been grappling with severe air pollution, which has been attributed to a variety of factors, including vehicular emissions. The BMTC operates a fleet of over 6,000 buses, of which a significant number are diesel-powered.

The petitioner argued that the use of diesel-powered buses was not only contributing to air pollution but was also causing health problems for the residents of the city. She contended that the BMTC should switch to CNG-powered fuel, which is cleaner and more environmentally friendly.

The court's decision to reserve the right to the petitioner to approach the NGT is significant as it recognizes the importance of environmental issues and the need for a specialized forum to adjudicate such matters. The NGT was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, with the mandate to handle cases related to environmental protection and conservation.

The NGT has the power to hear cases related to air and water pollution, biodiversity conservation, and climate change, among other environmental issues. It has the authority to issue orders and directions to government agencies, private companies, and individuals to take measures to protect the environment.

The court's decision to refer the matter to the NGT is also significant as it underscores the need for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to address the issue of air pollution in Bengaluru. The NGT has the power to issue orders and directions to multiple agencies and stakeholders, including the BMTC, to take measures to reduce air pollution in the city.

The NGT has already taken several steps to address the issue of air pollution in Bengaluru. In 2018, it directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to conduct a study on the impact of vehicular emissions on air quality in the city. The study found that vehicular emissions were the primary source of air pollution in Bengaluru, and recommended several measures to reduce emissions, including the use of CNG-powered buses.

The NGT has also directed the BMTC to take measures to reduce emissions from its buses, including the installation of particulate filters and the use of cleaner fuels. The BMTC has already taken some steps in this direction, including the introduction of electric buses and the conversion of some of its diesel-powered buses to run on biofuel.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reserve the right to the petitioner to approach the NGT for necessary orders is a significant step towards addressing the issue of air pollution in Bengaluru. The NGT has the power and expertise to handle environmental issues, and its intervention is crucial to ensure that the city's residents can breathe clean air. The court's decision also underscores the need for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to address environmental issues, and the role of specialized forums like the NGT in achieving this goal.
