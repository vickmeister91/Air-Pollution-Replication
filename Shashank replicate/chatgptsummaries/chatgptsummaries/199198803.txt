Amir Khan, a resident of Karera in the Shivpuri district, filed an application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as he feared arrest in connection with Crime No. 91/2017 registered by the Karera Police Station. The case was registered against him and other co-accused persons for offences punishable under Sections 353, 186, 341, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The prosecution alleged that the accused persons attacked forest personnel and took away a tractor and trolley along with the driver.

The applicant sought anticipatory bail on the grounds that he was falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the alleged offence. He also argued that he was a law-abiding citizen and had cooperated with the investigation. The applicant further contended that he was willing to abide by any conditions that the court may impose while granting him anticipatory bail.

The court, however, dismissed the application for anticipatory bail, stating that the illegal excavation of sand would adversely affect the environment of the locality. The court observed that the applicant's involvement in the alleged offence was a matter of investigation and that the court could not pre-judge the issue. The court further held that the applicant's apprehension of arrest was not well-founded and that he could approach the court for regular bail if he was arrested.

The court's decision was based on the principle that anticipatory bail is granted only in exceptional cases where the court is satisfied that the applicant has a genuine apprehension of arrest and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of the alleged offence. The court noted that the present case did not fall within the ambit of exceptional cases and that the applicant had failed to make out a case for anticipatory bail.

The court's decision was also influenced by the fact that the alleged offence was a serious one and that the applicant's involvement in the offence, if proved, would have serious consequences. The court observed that the offence was not a minor one and that it had the potential to cause harm to the environment and to the public at large.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the application for anticipatory bail filed by Amir Khan was based on the principle that anticipatory bail is granted only in exceptional cases. The court held that the present case did not fall within the ambit of exceptional cases and that the applicant had failed to make out a case for anticipatory bail. The court's decision was also influenced by the serious nature of the alleged offence and its potential to cause harm to the environment and to the public at large.
