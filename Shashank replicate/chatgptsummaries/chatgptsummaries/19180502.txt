The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by two sisters seeking joint patta (land ownership document) for lands in Sekkalakottai village, Sivagangai district. The lands in question were classified as 'Kadu' (forest) by the Forest Department and subsequently notified as Reserve Forest. The legal heirs of the original zamindar family filed an application for patta in 1995, which was rejected by the Director of Survey and Settlement in 2001. The first respondent dismissed the petitioners' appeal against this decision in 2003. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous judgments, but did not provide a final decision.

The court order states that pre-existing rights of occupants of land, except for public or communal properties, are recognized and cannot be destroyed by provisions relating to abolition and vesting of properties. The grant of patta is based on these pre-existing rights and cannot be equated to the grant of patta by way of assignment under Revenue Standing Orders or rules of assignment outside statutory enactments. The court also refers to previous judgments that state that the mere fact that land is described as poramboke in the land register does not establish the title of the government to the land.

The court dismisses the writ petition filed by the petitioners who were attempting to claim Ryotwari patta in respect of a notified forest, as they had not established any legal right to claim the land in question. The court order makes it clear that the pre-existing rights of occupants of land cannot be destroyed by provisions relating to abolition and vesting of properties. This means that if someone has been occupying a piece of land for a long time, they have a legal right to continue occupying it, even if the land is later classified as a forest or notified as Reserve Forest.

The court also makes it clear that the grant of patta is based on pre-existing rights and cannot be equated to the grant of patta by way of assignment under Revenue Standing Orders or rules of assignment outside statutory enactments. This means that if someone has been occupying a piece of land for a long time, they have a legal right to claim patta for that land, even if it is later classified as a forest or notified as Reserve Forest.

The court order also refers to previous judgments that state that the mere fact that land is described as poramboke in the land register does not establish the title of the government to the land. This means that just because the government has classified a piece of land as poramboke, it does not mean that they have the legal right to claim ownership of that land.

In this particular case, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the two sisters who were attempting to claim Ryotwari patta in respect of a notified forest, as they had not established any legal right to claim the land in question. This means that the court did not grant the sisters joint patta for the land in question.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of pre-existing rights of occupants of land and makes it clear that these rights cannot be destroyed by provisions relating to abolition and vesting of properties. The order also clarifies the process for granting patta and makes it clear that it is based on pre-existing rights, rather than being equated to the grant of patta by way of assignment under Revenue Standing Orders or rules of assignment outside statutory enactments. Finally, the order highlights the fact that the mere fact that land is described as poramboke in the land register does not establish the title of the government to the land.
