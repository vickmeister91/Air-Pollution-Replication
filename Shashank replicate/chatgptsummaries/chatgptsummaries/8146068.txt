The State, represented by the Inspector of Police, CBI, ACB, Chennai, filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to cancel the summons issued under section 91 of Cr.P.C. dated 13.06.2018 in Crl.MP.89 of 2018 in C.C. No.11 of 2009 pending on the file of the learned Trial court. The case involves allegations of cheating Southern Railway by allowing a firm to carry out work with substandard materials causing wrongful gain to the firm and corresponding wrongful loss to Southern Railways. The Trial Court had directed the respondents to produce the statement of witnesses, documents, S.P.'s report, and draft sanction order. The CBI challenged this order.

The court ordered the respondents to produce witness statements, documents, and a draft sanction order when the Sanctioning Authority appears before the court. However, the prosecution witness did not answer questions raised by the accused and did not produce the original sanction order. As a result, the court issued a summons for the document. The prosecution witness later appeared before the court and answered questions but was unable to secure the original records from the competent authority.

The court decided that it is for the Trial Court to decide whether the original sanction order is necessary or not, and the summons issued by the Trial Court has become infructuous. The Criminal Original Petition stands closed.
