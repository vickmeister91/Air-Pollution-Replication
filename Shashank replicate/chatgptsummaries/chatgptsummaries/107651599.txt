The court order pertains to an appeal filed by Shyam Sel & Power Limited against Bahubali Promoters Private Limited. The appeal arises from an order dated 30th January 2019, which dismissed an application filed by the appellant for stay of CS No. 152 of 2017. The appellant is the defendant in Suit No. 152 of 2017, which was filed by the plaintiff for eviction in 2010. The plaintiff claimed mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 13,000 per diem for wrongful occupation of the premises.

The appellant filed an application for stay of the suit on the ground that the decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench in F.A. No. 174 of 2016 would operate as res judicata in the instant suit. The said application was dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground that section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 would not apply in the instant case as the matter in issue in the City Civil Court cannot be said to be the matter in issue in the instant suit.

The court held that the suit for mesne profits is not barred under Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court also held that the appeal is a continuation of the suit and the question of unauthorized occupation of the defendant would come up for consideration in the appeal and it squarely fits into the expression "the matter in issue is directly and substantially in issue" in the previously instituted suit, namely, the suit for eviction and hence the second suit for mesne profits is liable to be stayed under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court order discusses the applicability of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a case where two suits have been filed with different causes of action. The court states that Section 10 applies only when the matter in issue in both suits is identical. The purpose of Section 10 is to prevent concurrent courts from adjudicating on the same matter, causing conflict of decisions and multiplicity of proceedings.

The court also cites previous cases to explain the conditions required to attract the provision of Section 10. The court ultimately concludes that Section 10 does not apply in this case as the matter in issue in both suits is different.

The court order discusses Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which aims to prevent courts of concurrent jurisdiction from trying two parallel suits between the same parties in respect of the same matter in issue. The key words in Section 10 are "the matter in issue is directly and substantially in issue" and apply only if there is identity of the matter in issue in both the suits.

The court also discusses the principle that an appeal is a continuation of a suit and can be subject to Section 10. In the instant case, the court finds that there is substantial identity of the matters in issue in both the suits and stays the subsequently instituted suit for mesne profits until the previously instituted suit for eviction is finally adjudicated.

The court notes that Section 10 would not be the only provision that governs stay of suits and that the court can exercise its inherent powers for the ends of justice.

In summary, the court order pertains to an appeal filed by Shyam Sel & Power Limited against Bahubali Promoters Private Limited.
