The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various challenges made to the examination and appointment processes for judges in the state of Orissa, India. In one case, a petitioner challenged the examination for regularization of the Fast Track Courts Additional District Judges, with a further prayer not to terminate the services of the petitioner. The court upheld the judgment of a previous case and directed that the process of selection for regular vacancies may continue but only for seven posts, not the nine currently held by the petitioners. The court also stated that the appointment under this scheme does not give any right to be appointed on a regular basis.

In another case, a writ petition was filed against the examination held for the regularization of the service of Ad hoc Additional District Judges of the Fast Track Court. The petitioner argued that he has already been selected and continued as Ad hoc Additional District Judge in the Fast Track Courts and should be allowed to continue as a regular Additional District Judge. The government advocate argued that the examination held for absorption or regularization of the Ad hoc Additional District Judges under the Fast Track Court Scheme as regular Additional District Judges is legal and proper. The court considered both arguments and discussed the history of appointments and judgments related to the Fast Track Court Scheme. The court directed that the petitioners will continue to hold their posts until further orders and their cases will be considered when regular vacancies arise. They do not need to appear in any examination meant for recruitment to the cadre of District Judge.

In another case, the court discussed the recruitment rules for direct District Judges in the state of Orissa. The Orissa Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial Service Rules, 2007 state that viva voce for direct District Judges has a cutoff mark of 40% to pass the interview. The court referred to a previous case and concluded that the Recruitment Rules must be followed for direct appointment to Higher Judicial Services. The court also noted that if statutory rules prescribe a particular mode of selection, it must be strictly adhered to. The advertisement requiring minimum marks in each paper is in conflict with the directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and is liable to be quashed.

In another case, a petitioner challenged the legality of an examination for the position of Additional District Judge. The court ruled that the petitioner was not eligible to challenge the examination as he had already participated in it and failed to qualify. The court also stated that the minimum interview mark stipulated by the OSJS & OJS Rule must be adhered to and that the advertisement made by the opposite party No.3 was not in accordance with the Hon'ble Apex Court. The court dismissed the writ petition as it was devoid of merit.

Finally, the court order discussed the Fast Track Court Scheme, which was only floated by the Central Government for a temporary purpose, and the judges were appointed till the scheme was continued. When the scheme came to an end, such judges appointed under FTC Scheme have no right to continue in service except as propounded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in their final judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-(2). The court stated that the policy decision of the Union of India not to finance the FTC Scheme beyond 31-3-2011 will not be struck down. States that have taken a policy decision to continue the FTC Scheme beyond this date must adhere to the respective dates announced. States that are in the process of deciding whether or not to continue the FTC Scheme are free to make their own decision. All states must not continue the FTC Scheme on an ad hoc and temporary basis. The Union of India and State Governments must re-allocate and utilize funds to ensure regularization of FTC judges and creation of additional courts. The court directed that all decisions made at the Chief Justices and Chief Ministers' Conference must be placed before the Cabinet for objective consideration and valid reasons. The court also directed the creation of additional posts for the Higher Judicial Services and Judicial Services Rules of the State. These directions are in addition to any recommendations made by the Law Commission of India and any other orders passed by the Courts of competent jurisdiction.

In summary, these court orders deal with various challenges to the appointment and examination processes for judges in the state of Orissa, as well as the Fast Track Court Scheme and its implications for judges appointed under it. The court has provided directions and guidelines for the proper implementation of these processes and schemes, with a focus on fairness and adherence to statutory rules.
