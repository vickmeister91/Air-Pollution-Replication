The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions challenging a provisional order of attachment passed by the Joint Director of Enforcement. The first writ petition was filed by the Indian Bank, while the second writ petition was filed by a company that borrowed money from the Indian Bank. The petitions arose from a complaint lodged by the Indian Bank against the company and its officers, alleging that they had defrauded the bank. The Joint Director of Enforcement passed an order directing the provisional attachment of the company's property, which was purchased with the money advanced by the Indian Bank. The court considered whether the property represented the proceeds of crime and whether the Bank's right to proceed against the property under the SARFAESI Act was impaired by the provisional order of attachment.

The respondents argued that the property was purchased using funds obtained through fraudulent means from three different banks, and therefore, the property represents the proceeds of crime. However, the court found that the property was purchased entirely using funds from the Indian Bank and that the criminal allegations against the company and its directors relate to scheduled offenses. The court also noted that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, does not consider the position of victims of such crimes. The court concluded that the property represents the proceeds of crime, and it is up to the accused to prove otherwise in a criminal court. The court also raised the question of where the victims stand in such cases, as the Act appears to punish them along with the accused.

The court also discussed the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and its provisions for confiscating property involved in money laundering. The court noted that the Act is accused-centric and Central Government-centric, and does not take into account the plight of victims of crime. The court found fault with the Adjudicating Authority for proceeding with the hearing of the original complaint despite being aware of an interim stay order, and for not impleading the Bank as a party. The court set aside the provisional order of attachment and all further proceedings pursuant to it, including the original complaint and the order of confirmation.

The court declared that the proceedings and order dated 26.6.2012 are illegal and set aside. The provisional order of attachment dated 22.2.2012 and all further proceedings are also set aside. The findings will not affect the criminal prosecution. The Joint Director of Enforcement and the Adjudicating Authority have been informed of the decision.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard two writ petitions challenging a provisional order of attachment passed by the Joint Director of Enforcement. The court found that the property in question represents the proceeds of crime and set aside the provisional order of attachment and all further proceedings pursuant to it. The court also raised concerns about the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and its provisions for confiscating property involved in money laundering, noting that the Act is accused-centric and Central Government-centric and does not take into account the plight of victims of crime. The court's decision will not affect the criminal prosecution, and the Joint Director of Enforcement and the Adjudicating Authority have been informed of the decision.
