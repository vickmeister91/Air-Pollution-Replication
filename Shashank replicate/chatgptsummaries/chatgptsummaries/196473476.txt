In a recent case involving a murder trial, the court dismissed two criminal original petitions filed by the accused challenging the orders passed by the trial court to summon bank records and witnesses. The prosecution had filed petitions under Sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. to summon records relating to the pledge of ornaments with the bank and to examine bank witnesses, respectively. The accused had challenged these orders, claiming that they were illegal and without jurisdiction.

However, the court found no infirmity in the orders passed by the trial court and dismissed the petitions. The court noted that the trial court had passed the orders after considering the evidence on record and the submissions made by both parties. The court also observed that the orders were passed in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and were not arbitrary or capricious.

The court further explained that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Similarly, Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to summon any person as a witness or to examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or to recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in issue.

The court also noted that the accused had not raised any specific ground to challenge the orders passed by the trial court. The accused had merely claimed that the orders were illegal and without jurisdiction. However, the court held that such a general allegation was not sufficient to challenge the orders passed by the trial court.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the criminal original petitions filed by the accused and upheld the orders passed by the trial court to summon bank records and witnesses. The court reiterated that the provisions of the Cr.P.C. empower a court to summon documents and witnesses that are necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court also emphasized that such orders are passed after considering the evidence on record and the submissions made by both parties, and are not arbitrary or capricious.
