The Bombay High Court has ordered the State Government to file an affidavit on the action taken against those who violated Noise Pollution Rules during the Ganpati Festival of 2018 and Eid-E-Milad held on 21st February 2018. The court found that the police officer who filed the affidavits did not take action in at least 12 cases of noise pollution violations and did not provide any explanation for inaction. The court directed the Commissioner of Police to file a personal affidavit explaining the issue and the action proposed to be taken against the police officers responsible for not taking any action against the breach of Noise Pollution Rules. The affidavit must be filed on or before 2nd March 2019.

The court has also ordered the AGP to communicate the order to the Commissioner of Police and forward copies of affidavits filed by Shri Singe. The Commissioner of Police is instructed to investigate the failure of the Mumbai Police to take action against violations of Noise Pollution Rules and note that the Special Leave Petition filed by the State Government has been dismissed. The petition will be placed on March 5th, 2019, at 3:00 pm for consideration of affidavits filed by the Commissioner of Police and Municipal Corporations.

The court's order comes after a petition was filed by activist Sumaira Abdulali, who has been fighting against noise pollution for over a decade. Abdulali had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking action against those who violated Noise Pollution Rules during the Ganpati Festival of 2018 and Eid-E-Milad held on 21st February 2018. The petition also sought action against the police officers who failed to take action against the violators.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the issue of noise pollution, which is a major problem in India. Noise pollution is not only a nuisance but also a health hazard. It can cause hearing loss, sleep disturbance, and other health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified noise pollution as a major environmental health hazard.

The court's order also highlights the importance of enforcing laws and regulations. The Noise Pollution Rules were introduced in 2000 to regulate noise levels in India. However, the rules are often flouted, and the authorities fail to take action against the violators. The court's order sends a strong message to the authorities that they must enforce the rules and take action against those who violate them.

The court's order is also a victory for activists like Sumaira Abdulali, who have been fighting against noise pollution for years. Abdulali has been working to create awareness about the issue and has been advocating for stricter enforcement of the rules. The court's order is a recognition of her efforts and a step towards a quieter and healthier India.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's order to the State Government to file an affidavit on the action taken against those who violated Noise Pollution Rules during the Ganpati Festival of 2018 and Eid-E-Milad held on 21st February 2018 is a significant step towards addressing the issue of noise pollution in India. The court's order highlights the importance of enforcing laws and regulations and sends a strong message to the authorities that they must take action against those who violate the rules. The court's order is also a victory for activists like Sumaira Abdulali, who have been fighting against noise pollution for years. It is hoped that the authorities will take the court's order seriously and work towards creating a quieter and healthier India.
