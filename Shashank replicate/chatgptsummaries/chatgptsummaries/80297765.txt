The court order in question relates to a criminal revision petition filed by B K Mangalgi against the State by Harapanahalli Police. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Sr. Civil Judge and J.M.F.C., Harapanahalli in C.C. No. 78/2011. However, the court dismissed the revision petition as it was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C.

The petitioner's counsel had argued that the order passed by the lower court was erroneous and that the petitioner had been wrongly convicted. The counsel had also submitted that the lower court had not considered certain crucial evidence that would have exonerated the petitioner.

However, the court found that the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. Section 397 provides for the revision of orders passed by subordinate courts. However, the court held that the order passed by the lower court was not an order passed by a subordinate court, but was in fact an order passed by a court of original jurisdiction.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the order passed by the lower court in a higher court, and had instead filed a revision petition directly in the court. The court held that this was not permissible under the law, and that the petitioner should have first challenged the order in a higher court before filing a revision petition.

The court further observed that the petitioner's counsel had not been able to point out any error in the order passed by the lower court. The court noted that the lower court had considered all the evidence on record and had arrived at a reasoned conclusion. The court held that it was not open to the petitioner to challenge the order on the ground that certain evidence had not been considered, as the petitioner had not raised this issue before the lower court.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the revision petition filed by the petitioner. The court also returned the certified copies of the order passed by the lower court on the request of the petitioner's counsel.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by B K Mangalgi against the State by Harapanahalli Police.

The court held that the order passed by the lower court was not an order passed by a subordinate court, but was in fact an order passed by a court of original jurisdiction.
