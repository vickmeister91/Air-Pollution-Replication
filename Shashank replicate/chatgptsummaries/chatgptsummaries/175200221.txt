The Ikkarai Boluvampatti Panchayat had filed a writ petition to prevent the District Forest Officer from interfering with their possession of five acres of land in Ikkarai Boluvampatti Forest Range-II. The land was originally owned by the forest department but was later handed over to the Panchayat. The Panchayat had paid a lease amount for the land, but the lease expired in 1996 and no renewal was granted. The Panchayat argued that they had been in possession of the land for over 50 years and had been using it for non-forest purposes such as constructing a community hall, a school, and a playground. They also claimed that they had been paying taxes on the land and had been maintaining it.

The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the land is a reserved forest and cannot be used for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The court cited the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The court also noted that the land was part of the Ikkarai Boluvampatti Forest Range-II, which was a reserved forest.

However, the court called upon the District Collector to take a decision on whether to forward a proposal to renew the lease to the Central Government within two months. The court noted that the Panchayat had been in possession of the land for over 50 years and had been using it for non-forest purposes. The court also noted that the Panchayat had paid taxes on the land and had been maintaining it. The court stated that the District Collector should consider these factors while taking a decision on whether to forward a proposal to renew the lease to the Central Government.

The court's decision highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before using forest land for non-forest purposes. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes and to ensure that the ecological balance is maintained. The Act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes should be approved by the Central Government. The Act also provides for penalties for violations of its provisions.

The court's decision also recognizes the rights of local communities to use forest land for non-forest purposes. The Panchayat had been using the land for over 50 years and had constructed a community hall, a school, and a playground on the land. The court's decision acknowledges the importance of these facilities for the local community and calls upon the District Collector to consider these factors while taking a decision on whether to renew the lease.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Ikkarai Boluvampatti Panchayat highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before using forest land for non-forest purposes. The decision also recognizes the rights of local communities to use forest land for non-forest purposes and calls upon the District Collector to consider the local community's interests while taking a decision on whether to renew the lease. The decision strikes a balance between the need to protect the environment and the need to provide basic facilities to local communities.
