The Bombay High Court has ordered the State Government to file an affidavit explaining the action taken against those who violated Noise Pollution Rules during the Ganpati Festival of 2018 and Eid-E-Milad held on 21st February 2018. The court found that the police officer who filed the affidavits did not take action in at least 12 cases of noise pollution violations and did not provide any explanation for inaction. The court directed the Commissioner of Police to file a personal affidavit explaining the issue and the action he proposes to take against the police officers responsible for not taking any action against the breach of Noise Pollution Rules. The affidavit must be filed by 2nd March 2019.

The court has also ordered the AGP to communicate the order to the Commissioner of Police and forward copies of affidavits filed by Shri Singe. The Commissioner of Police is instructed to investigate the failure of the Mumbai Police to take action against violations of Noise Pollution Rules and note that the State Government's Special Leave Petition has been dismissed. The petition will be placed on March 5th, 2019, at 3:00 pm for consideration of affidavits filed by the Commissioner of Police and Municipal Corporations.

The court's orders come in response to a public interest litigation filed by Awaaz Foundation, an NGO working towards the protection of the environment. The NGO had alleged that the Noise Pollution Rules were being violated during the Ganpati Festival and Eid-E-Milad, and the police were not taking any action against the violators.
