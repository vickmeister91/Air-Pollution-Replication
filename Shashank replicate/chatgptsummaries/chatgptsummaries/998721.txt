The Supreme Court of India has received several public interest litigation petitions regarding the protection of ecology and prevention of irreversible ecological damage in coastal areas. The court has issued several orders to ensure the implementation of regulations and guidelines for the protection of the environment in coastal areas.

In one of the court orders, the petitioner alleged that the Notification dated 19.2.1991, which declared coastal stretches as Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) and regulated activities in those zones, had not been implemented or enforced, leading to continued degradation of ecology in the coastal areas. The court ordered the implementation of the Notification and the preparation of Coastal Zone Management Plans by the coastal States and Union Territory Administrations. The court also discussed the norms for regulation of activities in CRZ I, II, III, and IV and the guidelines for development of beach resorts/hotels in the designated area of CRZ III for temporary occupation of tourists/visitors.

In another court order, the court discussed a writ petition regarding the non-implementation of a notification issued by the Central Government to regulate development in coastal areas and protect the environment. The petitioner alleged that industries are being set up illegally, causing damage to the ecology. The court issued directions to the coastal states and Union Territory Administrations to prepare management plans and enforce the provisions of the notification. The court also discussed the validity of an amended notification made in 1994 and the need for effective enforcement of environmental laws to prevent ecological degradation.

In yet another court order, the court discussed a 1994 Notification regarding the development of coastal areas in India. The court examined six amendments made to the notification, including the reduction of the no-development zone (NDZ) from 200 to 50 meters from the high tide line (HTL) and the allowance of construction within the NDZ with conditions. The court found that the provision giving the central government unbridled power to permit construction within the NDZ was ultra vires and quashed it. The court also found the reduction of the NDZ along tidal rivers from 100 to 50 meters to be arbitrary and illegal. However, the court allowed the installation of goal posts and lamp posts and modified the amendment allowing the inclusion of NDZ in FSI calculations to allow for compensation to private landowners while preventing haphazard construction. The court also allowed the construction of basements subject to approval from state groundwater boards.

In another court order, the court discussed the need to protect the environment and maintain ecological balance in the face of rapid industrialization. The court directed that any questions regarding the enforcement of environmental protection laws should be raised and dealt with by the respective High Courts. The court also directed the Central Government to consider setting up State Coastal Management Authorities and a National Coastal Management Authority. The court ordered the submission and finalization of Management Plans by all states and union territories, with non-compliant states being issued notices. The court also allowed for the construction of basements subject to certain conditions and permits fencing of privately owned property as long as it does not prevent public access to public beaches.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India has issued several orders to protect the environment and prevent ecological damage in coastal areas. The court has directed the implementation of regulations and guidelines for the protection of the environment in coastal areas, including the preparation of Coastal Zone Management Plans by the coastal States and Union Territory Administrations. The court has also discussed the validity of notifications and amendments made to regulations and guidelines and has quashed provisions that give unbridled power to permit construction within the no-development zone. The court has also directed the Central Government to consider setting up State Coastal Management Authorities and a National Coastal Management Authority. The court has ordered the submission and finalization of Management Plans by all states and union territories, with non-compliant states being issued notices. The court has also allowed for the construction of basements subject to certain conditions and permits fencing of privately owned property as long as it does not prevent public access to public beaches.
