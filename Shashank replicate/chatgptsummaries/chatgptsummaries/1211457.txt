The court order in question concerns a dispute over family property between descendants of a common ancestor. The matter had been referred to arbitration, and a decree was passed. However, one of the parties is now seeking a declaration that the decree was invalid. The lower court had dismissed the suit, and the plaintiff has now appealed.

The defendants in the case argue that the plaintiff has no good cause of action and is precluded from advancing their contentions due to the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff was a minor at the time of the reference, and their mother acted as their natural guardian.

The court has found that the matters raised by the plaintiff were previously determined in the proceedings taken under Section 525 of the Civil Procedure Code and cannot be relitigated. As a result, the court has confirmed the decree of the first court with costs.

The dispute over family property is a common issue that arises in many legal cases. In this particular case, the matter had been referred to arbitration, and a decree was passed. However, one of the parties is now seeking a declaration that the decree was invalid. The lower court had dismissed the suit, and the plaintiff has now appealed.

The defendants in the case argue that the plaintiff has no good cause of action and is precluded from advancing their contentions due to the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff was a minor at the time of the reference, and their mother acted as their natural guardian.

The court has found that the matters raised by the plaintiff were previously determined in the proceedings taken under Section 525 of the Civil Procedure Code and cannot be relitigated. As a result, the court has confirmed the decree of the first court with costs.

The court's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff's claims were already addressed in the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff's argument that the decree was invalid is not a new issue and was already considered by the arbitrator. Therefore, the court has found that the plaintiff has no good cause of action and is precluded from advancing their contentions.

The plaintiff's status as a minor at the time of the reference is also a factor in the court's decision. The plaintiff's mother acted as their natural guardian, and the court has found that the mother had the authority to represent the plaintiff in the arbitration proceedings. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot now argue that they were not properly represented in the arbitration.

In conclusion, the court has confirmed the decree of the first court with costs. The court has found that the matters raised by the plaintiff were previously determined in the proceedings taken under Section 525 of the Civil Procedure Code and cannot be relitigated. The plaintiff's status as a minor at the time of the reference is not a valid reason to challenge the arbitration proceedings. Therefore, the court has dismissed the plaintiff's appeal.
