The Jharkhand High Court recently allowed the petition of Parmeshwar Prasad, who had requested the quashing of the entire criminal proceeding against him in connection with Khunti P. S. Case No. 33 of 2013. The court found that the criminal proceeding was without any basis and contrary to the provisions envisaged under Section 43 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court quashed and set aside the order dated 29.07.2013 passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti, by which cognizance was taken for the offences punishable under Sections 379/278 of the I.P.C., under Section 4(i) of the Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulation) Act, 1916 and under Section 37 Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The case in question pertains to the alleged illegal mining of minerals in the Khunti district of Jharkhand. Parmeshwar Prasad was one of the accused in the case, and he had been charged with various offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulation) Act, 1916, and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the Jharkhand High Court found that the criminal proceeding against him was without any basis and contrary to the provisions of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court's decision was based on Section 43 of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Act except on a complaint made by, or with the previous sanction in writing of, the State Government or any officer authorized in this behalf by the State Government. In this case, the court found that the complaint against Parmeshwar Prasad was not made by the State Government or any authorized officer, and therefore, the criminal proceeding against him was without any basis.

The court also noted that the offences under the Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulation) Act, 1916, and the Indian Penal Code were not related to the alleged violation of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Therefore, the court quashed and set aside the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti, taking cognizance of the offences under these Acts.

The Jharkhand High Court's decision in this case is significant as it highlights the importance of following the due process of law while initiating criminal proceedings against an accused. The court's decision also underscores the need for strict adherence to the provisions of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, in cases related to environmental pollution.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to quash the criminal proceeding against Parmeshwar Prasad in connection with Khunti P. S. Case No. 33 of 2013 is a welcome development. The court's decision is a reminder that the due process of law must be followed while initiating criminal proceedings against an accused, and that strict adherence to the provisions of environmental laws is essential to protect the environment and public health.
