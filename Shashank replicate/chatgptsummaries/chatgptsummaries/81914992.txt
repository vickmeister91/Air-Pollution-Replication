The case of Ganesh Mongia, who has been in custody since February 2016 for allegedly killing a leopard, has been a matter of concern for many. The applicant's counsel argued that he is an old person with no criminal past and that the case is not so grave. The court has now granted bail to him, which is a relief for his family and supporters.

The court order states that the applicant will be released on a bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but it becomes ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that if the applicant fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of the bail, the bail will be cancelled, and he will be taken back into custody.

The court's decision to grant bail to Ganesh Mongia has been met with mixed reactions. While his family and supporters are relieved that he will be released from custody, some people are concerned that he may try to flee or tamper with evidence. However, the court has taken into consideration the fact that he is an old person with no criminal past and has granted him bail.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the applicant is innocent. It simply means that he will be released from custody until the end of the trial. The trial will continue, and the applicant will have to appear in court as and when required. The court will then decide whether he is guilty or not.
