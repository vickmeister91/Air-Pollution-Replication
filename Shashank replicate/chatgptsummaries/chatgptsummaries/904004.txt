The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently received a revision petition to quash an order that allowed an application for an ad-interim injunction filed by the plaintiff-respondents. The respondents had filed a suit for permanent injunction to prevent the petitioner from installing any machinery for running a stone crusher in a land area that would create a public nuisance. The court relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India and a notification issued by the Government of Haryana to conclude that installing a stone crusher was an actionable nuisance and a violation of the law. 

The petitioner argued that they had obtained a no objection certificate/consent from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board and that the stone crusher was being installed in a demarcated stone crusher zone. However, the court upheld the injunction, citing the potential environmental hazards and health risks to the inhabitants of the village. The court's decision was based on the fact that the installation of a stone crusher in the area would create a public nuisance and violate the law. The court relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, which held that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The petitioner's argument that they had obtained a no objection certificate/consent from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was not sufficient to override the court's decision. The court held that the issuance of a no objection certificate/consent did not mean that the installation of a stone crusher in the area was legal. The court also noted that the stone crusher was being installed in a demarcated stone crusher zone, but this did not mean that it was legal to install the stone crusher in the area.
