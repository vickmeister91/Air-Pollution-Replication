The Allahabad High Court recently heard a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, where the petitioner challenged the order passed by the Chief Environment Officer, U.P. Pollution Control Board, Lucknow, for the closure of the petitioner's unit of Cold Storage in Jalesar District Etah. The petitioner argued that the Board had not issued any show cause notice nor given any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner unit before passing the impugned orders.

The court disposed of the writ petition in terms of direction nos. (i) and (vii) of the order dated 02.12.2019 and issued directions to the Board to issue a show cause notice to the petitioner, provide an opportunity of hearing, and pass appropriate orders within one week. The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the fundamental right of a person to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following due process of law and the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making.

The court's decision is also a reminder to administrative authorities that they must follow the principles of natural justice and due process of law while taking any adverse action against a person or entity. Failure to do so can result in the court setting aside the decision and issuing directions for the authorities to follow the principles of natural justice and due process of law.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision in this case is a significant development in the field of administrative law. The court's decision upholds the fundamental right of a person to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them and highlights the importance of following due process of law and the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making.
