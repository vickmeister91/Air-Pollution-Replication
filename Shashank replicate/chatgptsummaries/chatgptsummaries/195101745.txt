The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies involved in the mining and marble industries, as well as individuals. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral.

One of the writ petitions is related to a demand notice for payment of Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner, one of the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur, has filed a writ petition praying for quashing of the demand notice and seeking a direction to restrain the respondents from recovering NPV amount from the petitioner. The court has been presented with various arguments by the learned Additional Advocate General, including the fact that the mining lease holders have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

Another writ petition is related to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of Net Present Value (NPV) shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land diversion.

The court order lists several civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan. No specific details about the content of the petitions are provided. However, the order mentions the lawyers representing the petitioners and the respondent.

In another writ petition, the court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The mining lease holders had refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed that the total common area being used by the mining lease holders in the cluster shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

Overall, the court order deals with multiple civil writ petitions related to mining leases and forest clearances in Rajasthan. The cases involve complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land diversion, as well as disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually and to divide the total common area being used by the mining lease holders in the cluster equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.
