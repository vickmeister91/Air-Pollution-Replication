The court order BLAPL/9188/2019 granted bail to Aruna Sahu and Dinabandhu Pradhan, who were implicated in a case related to the Wildlife Protection Act and the Odisha Forest Act. The court considered several factors before granting bail, including the nature of allegations, period of detention, lack of criminal antecedents, and the fact that the petitioners were permanent residents of the area. The petitioners were ordered to furnish a bail bond of Rs.20,000 with one solvent surety each. The BLAPL was disposed of, and an urgent certified copy of the order was to be granted.

The case in question involved allegations of violating the Wildlife Protection Act and the Odisha Forest Act. Aruna Sahu and Dinabandhu Pradhan were accused of cutting down trees and damaging the forest in the area. The court took into account the nature of these allegations before granting bail. The court also considered the period of detention, which was a significant factor in the decision to grant bail. The petitioners had been in detention for a considerable period, and the court felt that it was appropriate to grant them bail.

Another factor that the court considered was the lack of criminal antecedents of the petitioners. The court noted that the petitioners had no prior criminal record and were not likely to flee from justice. This was an important consideration in the decision to grant bail. The court also took into account the fact that the petitioners were permanent residents of the area. This meant that they were not likely to abscond and were likely to cooperate with the investigation.

The court ordered the petitioners to furnish a bail bond of Rs.20,000 with one solvent surety each. This was a standard requirement for granting bail. The surety was required to ensure that the petitioners would appear in court when required. The court also disposed of the BLAPL, which meant that the petitioners were no longer in custody. An urgent certified copy of the order was to be granted to the petitioners.

In conclusion, the court order BLAPL/9188/2019 granted bail to Aruna Sahu and Dinabandhu Pradhan, who were implicated in a case related to the Wildlife Protection Act and the Odisha Forest Act. The court considered several factors before granting bail, including the nature of allegations, period of detention, lack of criminal antecedents, and the fact that the petitioners were permanent residents of the area.
