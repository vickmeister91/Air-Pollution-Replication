The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Smt. Veena Rani against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the State to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The State was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water rendered there-from, analyze them, and place the analysis reports before the court. The state is ordered to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal within a given time frame. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs the state/local authorities to recover the same from such person by invoking the polluter pays principle. The court also directs citizens to be made aware of this direction through publication of notices on boards at prominent places, in news, as well as on radio and TV media. The court orders the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date.

The National Green Tribunal has issued an order for the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and for the marking and removal of encroachments. The State Government has been directed to issue show cause notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report filed by the State Government did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The Tribunal has ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government has been directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, and to file a compliance report.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide complete information and relevant records regarding the matter. The court has also suggested that those aggrieved by the actions of the authorities should approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that the tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction in a case where the original applicant is barred by limitation, and the issue has not yet been decided. The court has the discretion to insist on an alternative remedy even if it concludes that the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The jurisdiction of the tribunal is very wide and covers not only damage already caused but also the matter proposed to prevent any damage. The remedy given under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of this country. The writ petition is dismissed accordingly. The petitioner(s) is/are allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Such application/representation shall be filed by 31st December 2016. Till 31st December 2016, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s).
