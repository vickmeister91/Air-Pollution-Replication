The court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia against the State of Bihar. The petitioner had sought to restrain the respondents from interfering with his mining activities on an area broken up prior to 25.10.1980. The petitioner's lease had expired in 1989, and even though it was extended for one year due to the State Government's failure to pass an order on the renewal application, the lease had expired in 1990.

The court held that even for working on an area broken up prior to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the permission of the Central Government is necessary. The court vacated the interim order and ordered the petitioner to stop mining operations immediately.
