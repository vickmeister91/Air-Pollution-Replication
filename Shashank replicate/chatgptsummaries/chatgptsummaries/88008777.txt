The court order summaries revolve around a dispute over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land that was surrendered by a mining company. The petitioner, a lessee of mining lease, filed a writ application seeking relief from a demand notice claiming payment of Rs. 3,31,04,478/- towards NPV for a surrendered area of 45.3486 hectares. The petitioner also sought permission to commence mining operation over 67.1390 hectares in village Tikarpada, Ambadahara, Dist: Keonjhar. The court reviewed the case and provided a detailed summary of the events leading up to the demand notice.

The court notes that the conservation of forests and protection of the environment is important, and that before forest land is diverted for non-forest use, measures must be taken to compensate for the loss of forest land and its impact on the ecology. The court discusses the enactment of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to protect the environment and prevent decline in environmental quality. The Ministry of Environment and Forests was directed to formulate a scheme for compensatory afforestation whenever forest land is used for non-forest purposes. Guidelines were issued for the recovery/collection of NPV of forest land being diverted for non-forest purposes under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) was constituted for the purpose of managing money towards compensatory afforestation, NPV, and any other money recoverable in pursuance of the Supreme Court's order. The court also discusses the meaning of NPV and its application to the present context.

In the case at hand, the court found that since the surrendered area was not diverted for non-forest purpose under the FC Act, 1980, the petitioner is not liable to pay NPV. The court allowed the writ petition to the extent that the NPV would not be charged for the area which has been surrendered not being used for non-forest activities. The court ultimately disposes of the case, but highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection.

The court order summaries highlight the importance of protecting the environment and compensating for the loss of forest land before it is diverted for non-forest use. The court notes that the enactment of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the guidelines issued for the recovery/collection of NPV of forest land being diverted for non-forest purposes under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 are important steps towards achieving this goal. The court also emphasizes the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

Overall, the court order summaries provide insight into the legal framework surrounding the payment of NPV for forest land that is diverted for non-forest use. The court's emphasis on the importance of protecting the environment and compensating for the loss of forest land highlights the need for sustainable development practices.
