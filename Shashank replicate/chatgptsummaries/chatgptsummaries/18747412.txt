The recent court order pertains to two interlocutory applications related to compensatory afforestation management and planning authority (CAMPA) funds and the identification of 'forest' in the state of Rajasthan. The court has listed the applications for hearing on July 19, 2018. The order also mentions the Kapoor Committee Report and the Report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and the objections raised by the State of Rajasthan with regard to recommendations made by the CEC. The court finds no substance in the objections and accepts Recommendation Nos. (i) and (iii) given by the CEC. The order also discusses the treatment of sacred groves as forest land in Rajasthan.

The court order states that certain areas in Rajasthan should be treated as 'forest land' and may be included in the category of 'deemed forest' after being identified by an Expert Committee. The lands that have already been diverted prior to the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 need to be identified, surveyed, demarcated, and diverted in accordance with the law. The court accepts the recommendations made by the CEC and expects the State of Rajasthan to comply with them expeditiously.

The court order is significant as it addresses the issue of compensatory afforestation management and planning authority (CAMPA) funds, which are collected from industries that use forest land for non-forest purposes. These funds are meant to be used for afforestation and reforestation activities, but there have been concerns about their proper utilization. The court's decision to accept the recommendations made by the CEC is a positive step towards ensuring that these funds are used effectively for the purpose they were intended.

The court's decision to treat certain areas in Rajasthan as 'forest land' and include them in the category of 'deemed forest' is also significant. This will help in protecting these areas from further degradation and destruction. The identification, survey, demarcation, and diversion of lands that have already been diverted prior to the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 in accordance with the law will also help in ensuring that these lands are used in a sustainable manner.

The court's decision to accept Recommendation Nos. (i) and (iii) given by the CEC is particularly important. Recommendation No. (i) pertains to the identification of 'forest' in the state of Rajasthan. The CEC had recommended that the state government should identify and notify all areas that meet the criteria of 'forest' as per the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The state government had raised objections to this recommendation, but the court found no substance in these objections and accepted the recommendation.

Recommendation No. (iii) pertains to the treatment of sacred groves as forest land in Rajasthan. The CEC had recommended that all sacred groves in the state should be treated as forest land and protected accordingly. The state government had again raised objections to this recommendation, but the court found no substance in these objections and accepted the recommendation.

Overall, the court order is a positive step towards ensuring the protection and conservation of forests in Rajasthan. The decision to accept the recommendations made by the CEC and treat certain areas as 'forest land' will help in protecting these areas from further degradation and destruction. The decision to ensure the proper utilization of CAMPA funds is also a positive step towards ensuring that these funds are used effectively for the purpose they were intended. The court's decision to accept Recommendation Nos. (i) and (iii) given by the CEC is particularly important as it will help in ensuring that all areas that meet the criteria of 'forest' as per the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 are identified and protected accordingly.
