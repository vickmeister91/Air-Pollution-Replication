The Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The KSPCB is responsible for enforcing the provisions of these Acts and ensuring that industries comply with the pollution control norms.

In a recent case, a petitioner challenged an order passed by the government reconstituting the KSPCB before the expiry of his term. The petitioner argued that the action was invalid in law as he was nominated for a period of three years. The government, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner was nominated in a casual vacancy and would only get the remainder of the term.

The court closed the writ petition without expressing anything on the merits of the contentions of the parties, as the three non-official members nominated by the government were not impleaded as respondents in the writ petition.
