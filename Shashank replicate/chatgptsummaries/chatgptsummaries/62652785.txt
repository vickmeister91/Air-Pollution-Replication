The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by agricultural coolies seeking relief from forest officials interfering with their possession and enjoyment of land in Tiruvallur district. The first petitioners claim to have been cultivating the land for several decades and have sought assignment of patta for the same. The forest department has issued a notice to evict the petitioners, citing a gazette notification from 1969 that reserved the land for declaring it as reserved forest land. The second petitioners were seeking relief from Section 68 A, which states that any land, including reserved or government land, used for any crop or product without permission is liable for forfeiture. Any building or construction on the land is also liable for forfeiture.

The court dismissed the first petitioners' claim, stating that they have no right, title, or interest over the land and are unauthorized occupants or trespassers. The court cited a Supreme Court order that prohibits granting patta for forest land and regularizing encroachments. The court order also stated that the forest department has the right to evict the petitioners and take possession of the land. The first petitioners' claim was dismissed, and the forest department was allowed to proceed with the eviction process.

In the case of the second petitioners, the court dismissed their request to forbear the respondents from interfering with their possession and enjoyment of the land. The petitioners were given a copy of the notice issued under Section 68 A and were allowed to submit their reply within 15 days. The authorities concerned were directed to decide the issue within a reasonable period, preferably within four weeks. The court dismissed the petition and vacated the interim order granted earlier.

The court order highlights the importance of following the law and obtaining proper permission before using any land, especially reserved or government land. The court has made it clear that unauthorized occupation or trespassing on forest land is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. The court has also emphasized the need for authorities to take action within a reasonable period to avoid unnecessary delays and disputes.

The court's decision to dismiss the first petitioners' claim and allow the forest department to proceed with the eviction process is in line with the law and the Supreme Court's order prohibiting the regularization of encroachments on forest land. The court's decision to dismiss the second petitioners' claim and allow the authorities to proceed with the forfeiture process under Section 68 A is also in line with the law and emphasizes the need for proper permission before using any land.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of following the law and obtaining proper permission before using any land, especially reserved or government land. The court has made it clear that unauthorized occupation or trespassing on forest land is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. The court's decision to dismiss both petitions and allow the authorities to proceed with the eviction and forfeiture process is in line with the law and emphasizes the need for proper permission before using any land. The court has also emphasized the need for authorities to take action within a reasonable period to avoid unnecessary delays and disputes.
