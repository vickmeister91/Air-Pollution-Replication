The first court order pertains to a petition filed by the Campaign for People Participation under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought to declare the New Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 as ultra vires Part IXA and violative of Articles 13, 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner also sought a mandamus directing the respondent to take necessary steps immediately for directing the election of the Municipality of New Delhi area. The petitioner argued that the municipality constituted under the impugned Act does not provide for the proper structure of the municipality as there are a number of ex officio members and not elected representatives.

The court allowed reporters to see the judgment and ordered that it should be reported in the Digest. The court held that the notification issued by the President under Article 243ZB of the Constitution of India applies to the National Capital Territory of Delhi insofar as it relates to the New Delhi Municipal Council, subject to certain exceptions and modifications. The Delhi Development Authority Act and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act are to be read together, and the powers given to the legislative assembly of NCT of Delhi are in consonance with the constitutional scheme.

The court rejected the argument that the notification lapsed after the expiry of the period for the Ordinance and stated that the notification is still valid and continues to apply. The court also dismissed the writ petition as devoid of merit and rejected the oral prayer for grant of certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court.

In summary, the court order upheld the validity of the notification issued by the President under Article 243ZB of the Constitution of India, which applies Chapter IXA to the Delhi Municipal Council with exceptions and modifications. The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the municipality constituted under the New Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 does not provide for the proper structure of the municipality as there are a number of ex officio members and not elected representatives.

The second court order discusses the same notification issued by the President under Article 243ZB of the Constitution of India. The court rejects the argument that the notification lapsed after the expiry of the period for the Ordinance and states that the notification is still valid and continues to apply. The court also dismisses the writ petition as devoid of merit and rejects the oral prayer for grant of certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court.

In conclusion, both court orders uphold the validity of the notification issued by the President under Article 243ZB of the Constitution of India, which applies Chapter IXA to the Delhi Municipal Council with exceptions and modifications. The court also rejects the petitioner's argument that the municipality constituted under the New Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 does not provide for the proper structure of the municipality as there are a number of ex officio members and not elected representatives.
