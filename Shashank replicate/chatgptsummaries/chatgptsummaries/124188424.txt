In a recent court order, Iqbal Khan was charged with violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act by possessing 25 live parakeets without a license. The prosecution presented four witnesses, but the court found several contradictions in their statements and acquitted the accused. The court noted that there were doubts about the place of the raid, the date of release of the recovered birds, and the number of cages in which the parakeets were kept. The court also observed that the recovered parakeets were not produced in the same condition in which they were recovered.

The defense counsel argued that there were contradictions in the prosecution's story, and the accused's arrest was doubtful. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the accused and ordered their acquittal. The case property was confiscated to the state, and bail bonds were canceled. The court also noted that the non-joining of independent witnesses made the prosecution story unbelievable.

The case of Iqbal Khan is a classic example of how the prosecution's case can fall apart if there are contradictions in the statements of the witnesses.

The defense counsel played a crucial role in this case by pointing out the contradictions in the prosecution's story and questioning the accused's arrest. The court found that the defense counsel's arguments were valid and ordered the accused's acquittal. The court also confiscated the case property to the state and canceled the bail bonds.

The court's decision to acquit the accused in this case sends a strong message to the prosecution that they need to present a strong case with credible witnesses.
