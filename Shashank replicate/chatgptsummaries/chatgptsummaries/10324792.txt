The case in question involves a challenge by the Executive Officer of Cuttack Municipal Corporation against an order passed by the Cess Appellate Committee, State Pollution Control Board, Bhubaneswar. The order confirmed an assessment imposing water cess, which the petitioner argued was passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard and violated the principle of natural justice.

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the petitioner had consistently failed to furnish returns in prescribed Form I. The assessing authority had conducted an enquiry and made an assessment for payment of water cess in consonance with the statute itself. The court dismissed the writ application, stating that the petitioner cannot be exonerated from the statutory liability which it is otherwise liable to pay.

The case highlights the importance of complying with statutory requirements and the consequences of failing to do so. The court's decision reinforces the principle that statutory liabilities cannot be avoided simply by claiming a lack of opportunity to be heard or alleging a violation of natural justice.

The petitioner's argument that they were not given an opportunity to be heard was not accepted by the court. The court found that the assessing authority had conducted an enquiry and made an assessment for payment of water cess in consonance with the statute itself. The petitioner's failure to furnish returns in prescribed Form I was a clear violation of the statutory requirements, and the assessing authority had acted in accordance with the law.

The court's decision is significant because it reinforces the importance of complying with statutory requirements. The petitioner's failure to comply with the statutory requirements resulted in the imposition of water cess, and the court's decision upheld the assessment. The court's decision also highlights the importance of conducting enquiries and assessments in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of complying with statutory requirements and the consequences of failing to do so. The court's decision also highlights the importance of conducting enquiries and assessments in accordance with the law. The petitioner's failure to comply with the statutory requirements resulted in the imposition of water cess, and the court's decision upheld the assessment. The court's decision serves as a reminder that statutory liabilities cannot be avoided simply by claiming a lack of opportunity to be heard or alleging a violation of natural justice.
