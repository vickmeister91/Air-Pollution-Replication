The Delhi High Court recently heard a public interest litigation case regarding the inhumane and unhygienic conditions at the Idgah Slaughter House in Delhi. The petitioner claimed that the slaughterhouse was violating laws and regulations by discharging highly polluting effluents into public places and the Yamuna river, causing health hazards for residents. The petitioner also alleged that the slaughtering of animals was done in a barbaric manner, violating animal cruelty laws. The court was informed that various Acts and rules were being violated, including the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Air (Prevention & Control) Pollution Act. The court was also reminded of the State's obligation to improve public health and protect the environment under the Constitution.

The court order emphasizes the importance of a safe environment for human beings to lead a healthy life. The petitioner argues that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has violated various provisions of acts related to the construction and maintenance of municipal markets and slaughterhouses, drainage systems, and the supply of wholesome water. The court is informed that the earth is degrading at an alarming rate, and the emergence of an ecological crisis could lead to the extinction of mankind. The petitioner also refers to provisions of English Acts related to the prevention of cruelty to animals, indicating that even when animals are slaughtered for food, unnecessary pain and suffering should be avoided. The court order highlights the need for compliance with laws and regulations to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.

The court order outlines various regulations and provisions in English law that aim to prevent unnecessary pain and distress to animals, particularly in slaughterhouses and during transportation. The court has issued a notice to respondents regarding the conditions in the Idgah slaughterhouse and its adjoining areas, and the respondents have denied violating any acts or rules. The court has received minutes of a meeting held by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi regarding the sanitary and hygienic conditions of the slaughterhouse, and the parties involved have agreed that the livestock market must be shifted to a new location. The court has also been assured that necessary improvements will be made to maintain hygienic conditions in the slaughterhouse.

The court order discusses the conditions at the Idgah slaughterhouse in Delhi, including the lack of water for animals and complaints of insanitation. An affidavit from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee states that slaughtering animals causes water and air pollution, and that an effluent treatment plant has not been installed. The court appoints a committee to investigate the conditions at the slaughterhouse, including the number of animals slaughtered, hygiene and sanitation facilities, and the disposal of carcasses. The committee reports on the congestion and cruelty towards animals at the slaughterhouse, as well as the lack of separate areas for different types of livestock.

The court order discusses the inspection of an abattoir and the committee's findings on various aspects such as the number of animals slaughtered per day, available facilities for hygiene and sanitation, and the medical examination of animals before and after slaughter. The committee found that the abattoir was overburdened and lacked proper sanitation facilities. The medical examination of animals was not conducted properly, and the veterinary doctors were unable to conduct a thorough examination due to the large number of animals and confrontational attitude of the butchers. The committee recommended various suggestions to improve the situation.

The court order discusses the findings of a committee that investigated the conditions at an abattoir. The committee found that there were not enough veterinary doctors to properly examine the animals, and that the transportation of the animals was inhumane and unsanitary. The committee also found that the traditional methods of slaughtering were cruel and barbaric, and that there was a large amount of illegal slaughtering taking place. The committee made several suggestions, including providing proper security for the veterinary doctors, reducing the number of animals being slaughtered, and implementing age limits for the animals being slaughtered. The court also suggested that the slaughterhouse be relocated due to its location in a densely populated area. The court agreed with the committee's findings and ordered that the number of animals being slaughtered be reduced to improve hygiene and cleanliness.

The court order discusses the conditions at the Idgah slaughterhouse in Delhi and the need for improvement. The court suggests that the number of animals slaughtered should be reduced to improve hygiene and cleanliness, and that the livestock market should be shifted to a different location. The court also notes that the existing slaughterhouse facilities are inadequate and unsuitable for the production of hygienic meat, and that a modern slaughterhouse should be constructed. The court considers the arguments of various parties, including those related to the export of meat, and ultimately concludes that the prevailing conditions at the slaughterhouse pose a serious threat to the health of residents and must be improved. The court also notes that every citizen has a right to fresh air and to live in a pollution-free environment.

The court order describes the horrific and inhumane conditions at the Idgah slaughterhouse in Delhi, India, as depicted in numerous photographs and video footage. The court orders the closure of the slaughterhouse or, if it continues to operate, a reduction in the number of animals slaughtered per day and strict adherence to hygiene and sanitation standards. The court also orders the appointment of a high-powered committee to ensure compliance with the directions and to give necessary directions from time to time. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is directed to provide necessary help and assistance to the committee in its functioning. The petitioner is awarded Rs.
