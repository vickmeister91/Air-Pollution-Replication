The court recently heard a writ petition filed by Reji Kuriakose against the Secretary and others. The petitioner sought a writ of certiorari or any other writ or order or direction quashing Ext.P15, a writ of mandamus directing the 1st respondent to issue a certificate of licence for the period 2017-2018, and a writ of mandamus directing the respondents not to interfere with the functioning of the quarrying operation of the petitioner for want of environmental clearance. The court heard arguments from both sides and will issue a judgment at a later date.

The court order pertains to the renewal of a quarrying license and the requirement of environmental clearance for the same. The petitioner argues that no environmental clearance is required as per previous court decisions and that the rejection of the license is invalid. The court orders that the Panchayat Council should consider the renewal application along with all required documents and pass orders within three weeks, without insisting on environmental clearance. The objections of the 4th respondent should also be considered.
