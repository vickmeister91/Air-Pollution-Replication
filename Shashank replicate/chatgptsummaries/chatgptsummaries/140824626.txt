The National Green Tribunal heard a case filed by Smt. Mithlesh Bai Patel, an elected Sarpanch of Village Pratappur, challenging the grant of a Prospecting License (PL) for laterite mineral mining in an area of 5.42 hectares in Khasra No. 413 of village Pratappur, Tehsil Siroha, District Jabalpur. The land in question is under the control of the Revenue Department and has approximately 397 Mahua trees standing in the area allotted for PL, falling under the definition of 'Forest' as given under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Applicant claimed that the grant of PL will lead to removal/damage of the huge number of existing Mahua trees and affect the ecology and environment in the area besides robbing the livelihood opportunities of the villagers.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the grant of a Prospecting License (PL) for mining on a government-owned land in Madhya Pradesh, India. The applicant claims that the land is a forest land and should not have been granted PL for mining. The respondents argue that the land is revenue land and not a forest land, and that the PL was granted in accordance with the law. The court examines various reports and affidavits submitted by the parties and concludes that the land in question is revenue land and not a forest land, and that the PL was granted in accordance with the law. The court dismisses the applicant's plea to quash the impugned order granting the PL.

The court order discusses a dispute over the granting of a prospecting license (PL) for laterite mining on a piece of land in Pratappur village. The applicant challenges the decision on the grounds of disturbance of ecological balance and the potential felling of over 100-year-old Mahua trees, which are a source of livelihood for the villagers. The respondent denies the allegations and argues that the land is not a forest and that no trees need to be cut for prospecting. The court examines three points, including whether the land qualifies as a forest, whether there are any rules prohibiting cutting of Mahua trees, and whether there is a violation of environmental laws in granting the PL. The court concludes that the land is not a notified forest, and there are no rules prohibiting cutting of Mahua trees on revenue lands. The court also notes that the decision to grant the PL for laterite mining does not fall under its purview, and the applicant may challenge it with the appropriate authority or court of law.

The court order states that a piece of land with tree growth cannot be defined as a forest and therefore is not subject to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court also notes that there are restrictions on cutting trees in the area, but no complete ban on cutting Mahua trees. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable development and environmental protection in mining operations and requires an Environmental Clearance (EC) from the authorities before granting a mining lease. The court dismisses the original application but allows the applicant to approach the appropriate forum if a mining lease is granted in violation of any law.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute over the grant of a Prospecting License (PL) for laterite mineral mining in an area of 5.42 hectares in Khasra No. 413 of village Pratappur, Tehsil Siroha, District Jabalpur. The applicant, Smt. Mithlesh Bai Patel, challenged the grant of PL on the grounds that it would lead to the removal/damage of the huge number of existing Mahua trees and affect the ecology and environment in the area besides robbing the livelihood opportunities of the villagers.
