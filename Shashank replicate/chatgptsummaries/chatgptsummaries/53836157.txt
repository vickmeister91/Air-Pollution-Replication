The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and individuals who have applied for licenses to operate industrial units. In the first case, Yashpal Gupta had applied for a license to operate his industrial unit under a scheme meant for granting temporary licenses to run units in non-confirming areas until relocation. However, the MCD had neither passed any order allowing nor rejecting his application, nor replied to the legal notice issued on behalf of Gupta. The suit filed by Gupta was dismissed, and he appealed against the decision. The court observed that the area where Gupta was running his business was a non-residential area in the municipal records. The court also noted that the MCD had granted licenses to owners of neighboring units, and Gupta had been challaned in the past for running the unit without a license. The court framed a single issue regarding Gupta's entitlement to the relief of mandatory injunction.

In the second case, the court order states that no polluting factory units should be allowed in residential areas. The case in question is whether the appellant/plaintiff was running their unit in a residential or commercial area. The appellant/plaintiff had applied for a license to run their unit and submitted all necessary documents and fees, but the respondent/defendant MCD did not respond to their application. The court found that the MCD's conduct was violative of fundamental rights and basic principles of natural justice. The court also criticized the MCD for not producing relevant documents and failing to respond to the appellant/plaintiff's application. The court ordered that the appellant/plaintiff should be allowed to continue running their unit with a license.

In the third case, the court order pertains to a case where the respondent, MCD, failed to establish that the appellant was running his unit in a non-conforming area. The MCD also failed to provide any reason for not acting on the appellant's license application. The court directed the MCD to consider the application in a fair and equitable manner and communicate a decision within 60 days. The appeal was partly allowed, and the decree sheet was to be prepared.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of fair and equitable treatment by government agencies when it comes to granting licenses for industrial units. In the first case, the court found that the MCD had granted licenses to owners of neighboring units, but had failed to act on Gupta's application. This suggests that there may have been some bias or discrimination at play. In the second case, the court criticized the MCD for not responding to the appellant/plaintiff's application and failing to produce relevant documents. This again suggests a lack of transparency and fairness in the licensing process. In the third case, the court directed the MCD to consider the application in a fair and equitable manner and communicate a decision within 60 days. This emphasizes the importance of timely and transparent decision-making by government agencies.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder that government agencies must act fairly and transparently when it comes to granting licenses for industrial units. This is important not only for the individuals seeking licenses, but also for the broader community, as polluting factory units can have negative impacts on public health and the environment. By ensuring that the licensing process is fair and equitable, government agencies can help to promote sustainable and responsible industrial development.
