The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed an application challenging an order by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to close the petitioner's unit. The court stated that the order was appealable under Section 33B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and therefore the application was dismissed on that ground alone. The court clarified that the dismissal of the petition would not prevent the petitioner from seeking appropriate remedies before the appropriate forum in accordance with the law.

The case involved a petitioner who had been issued an order by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to close their unit due to violations of pollution control norms. The petitioner challenged the order in court, arguing that it was arbitrary and illegal. However, the court dismissed the application on the grounds that the order was appealable under Section 33B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

Section 33B of the Act provides for an appeal mechanism against orders issued by the Pollution Control Board. The section states that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Board under the Act may prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority within 30 days from the date on which the order is communicated to him. The Appellate Authority is required to dispose of the appeal within a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of the appeal.

The court's decision to dismiss the application on the grounds of appealability under Section 33B is in line with the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for a specific mechanism for challenging orders issued by the Pollution Control Board, and the court's decision ensures that this mechanism is followed.

The court also clarified that the dismissal of the petition would not prevent the petitioner from seeking appropriate remedies before the appropriate forum in accordance with the law. This means that the petitioner can still challenge the order before the Appellate Authority or any other appropriate forum in accordance with the law.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the appeal mechanism provided under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Act provides for a specific mechanism for challenging orders issued by the Pollution Control Board, and it is important for individuals and entities to follow this mechanism in order to ensure that their rights are protected. The court's decision also ensures that the petitioner has the opportunity to seek appropriate remedies before the appropriate forum in accordance with the law.
