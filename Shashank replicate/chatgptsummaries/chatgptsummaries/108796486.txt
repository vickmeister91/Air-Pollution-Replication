The Madhya Pradesh court recently issued a ruling in a case involving several petitions related to the discharge of effluent from dairies into rivers. The Pollution Control Board had issued closure orders to eight dairies, and the state had disconnected their electricity supply. However, the dairy owners claimed that their electricity supply was still uninterrupted. The court deferred the hearing until April 29, 2014, and directed the Pollution Control Board to conduct surprise inspections of the dairies to verify compliance. The court also asked the petitioners to provide information on the names of dairies and their locations. The issue of whether the used water from the dairies was causing pollution was also to be examined by the Pollution Control Board.
