Shree Digvijay Cement, a cement manufacturing company, has been embroiled in a legal battle with the authorities over its mining activity near Barda Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat. The company has leases for mining limestone in various mines in the state, but its operations near the sanctuary were halted in 2013 by an order from the respondent authorities. The order directed the company not to operate its mining lease, citing concerns over the impact on the environment and wildlife in the area.

In response, Shree Digvijay Cement filed a Special Civil Application seeking to quash and set aside the order and stay its implementation. The company argued that the leased area was outside the eco-sensitive zone and that there was no reason for stopping its mining operations. The court directed the respondent authorities to file a reply affidavit in response to the company's allegations.

The Deputy Conservator of Forests filed an affidavit and a map showing the distance of the leased area from Barda Wildlife Sanctuary. However, the court was not satisfied with the response and directed the respondents to file further affidavits on the allegations made by the petitioners. The court disposed of the petition with a direction to the respondents to reconsider the matter and pass appropriate fresh orders in the light of the notification dated 28.4.2017, issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, within a period of 4 weeks from the date of receipt of this order.

The case highlights the delicate balance between economic development and environmental conservation. While mining activities can provide employment and contribute to economic growth, they can also have adverse effects on the environment and wildlife. The authorities must ensure that mining activities are carried out in a sustainable manner, taking into account the impact on the environment and the local communities.

The court's decision to direct the respondents to reconsider the matter and pass appropriate fresh orders in the light of the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is a step in the right direction. The notification provides guidelines for the management of eco-sensitive zones around wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, and the authorities must take these guidelines into account while making decisions on mining activities in the area.

It is important to note that the court did not quash the order or allow the company to resume its mining operations. Instead, it directed the authorities to reconsider the matter and pass appropriate fresh orders. This indicates that the court is taking a cautious approach and is mindful of the need to balance economic development with environmental conservation.

In conclusion, the case involving Shree Digvijay Cement highlights the importance of sustainable development and the need to balance economic growth with environmental conservation. The court's decision to direct the authorities to reconsider the matter and pass appropriate fresh orders in the light of the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is a positive step towards achieving this balance. It is hoped that the authorities will take into account the guidelines provided by the notification and make decisions that are in the best interests of both the environment and the local communities.
