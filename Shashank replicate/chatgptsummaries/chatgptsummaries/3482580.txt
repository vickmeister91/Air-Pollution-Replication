The court order pertains to four different writ petitions filed against the State of Telangana, all related to the legality of the State Government's actions in granting mining leases over forest land. The first petition, filed by Ms. Exotic Granites Exports, challenges the State Government's decision to grant a black granite quarry lease to A.P. Mineral Development Corporation Limited instead of the petitioner, who had applied for the lease and received approval from the Central Government subject to certain conditions. The petitioner argues that the State Government's decision was illegal and arbitrary. The court hears arguments from both sides and reserves judgment.

The second petition pertains to three different cases and examines the legality of the State Government's actions in cancelling proposals for diversion of reserved forest areas and sending proposals for diversion of forest areas in favor of the Mineral Development Corporation. The court considers whether the State Government's actions are authorized, legal, valid, and permissible, and whether they have legal sanctity. The court also examines whether the actions are in accordance with the Forest Conservation Act and the Rules framed there-under, and whether they violate the principle of promissory estoppel and the doctrine of legitimate expectation. The court ultimately concludes that the State Government's actions are without jurisdiction and cannot be justified under the law.

The third petition challenges the revocation of approvals granted under the Forests Conservation Act. The petitioner argues that the revocation is contrary to the Principle of Promissory Estoppel and the doctrine of legitimate expectation. The court cites several cases to support the petitioner's argument and ultimately rules in favor of the petitioner. The court also finds that the State Government failed to adhere to the mandatory requirement of sending the application to the Union of India within 210 days, rendering the exercise invalid. The court further notes that the conduct of the respondents compelled the petitioner to pay certain amounts and purchase land, and therefore, the principles of Promissory Estoppel apply.

The fourth petition pertains to the registration of land in favor of the State Government through sale deeds in 2006. The petitioner was forced to purchase the land for afforestation due to the conduct of the respondents, and therefore, the impugned action is contrary to the principle of Estoppel and the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation. The court also rejects the contention that the petitioner's proposal was invalid and approves the proposal for re-diversion of forest land for mining lease. The court allows the writ petition and directs the respondents to consider the petitioner's application for grant as per law. The second petition is dismissed.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of adhering to legal procedures and principles when granting mining leases over forest land. The court emphasizes the need to consider the impact of such leases on the environment and the rights of local communities. The court also stresses the importance of upholding the principles of Promissory Estoppel and the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation, which protect individuals and organizations from arbitrary and unfair actions by the government. The court's rulings in these writ petitions serve as a reminder to the State Government and other authorities to act in accordance with the law and to respect the rights of all stakeholders involved in mining activities.
