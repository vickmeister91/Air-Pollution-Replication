The court order in question relates to a writ petition filed by Satyendra Pandey, who challenged an order issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board directing him to shut down his industrial/grill making plant due to environmental violations. The court, after hearing both sides, found no illegality in the order and dismissed the writ petition.

Satyendra Pandey's industrial/grill making plant was found to be in violation of environmental regulations, prompting the Bihar State Pollution Control Board to issue an order directing him to shut down the plant. Pandey, however, challenged the order by filing a writ petition in court.

During the hearing, the court examined the evidence presented by both parties and found that the plant was indeed in violation of environmental regulations. The court also noted that the Bihar State Pollution Control Board had followed due process in issuing the order to shut down the plant.

The court further observed that the purpose of environmental regulations is to protect the environment and prevent harm to public health. In this case, the court found that the operation of Pandey's plant was causing harm to the environment and therefore, the order to shut down the plant was justified.

The court also noted that the right to carry on a business or trade is not an absolute right and is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public health and safety. In this case, the court found that the order to shut down the plant was a reasonable restriction in the interest of public health and safety.

In conclusion, the court found no illegality in the order issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board directing Satyendra Pandey to shut down his industrial/grill making plant due to environmental violations. The court dismissed the writ petition filed by Pandey and upheld the order issued by the pollution control board. The court's decision reinforces the importance of environmental regulations in protecting public health and the environment.
