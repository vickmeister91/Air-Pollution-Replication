The court order pertains to a case between Munish Kumar Sharma and Kamal Khanna & Anr. regarding a tenanted property in Delhi. Sharma claims to be the co-owner of the property and has orally rented it out to Khanna since 1988. Sharma has filed a petition seeking possession of the property for his growing family's needs. However, Khanna has sought leave to contest the petition, alleging collusion between Sharma and his brother, who is also a co-owner of the property. Khanna has also raised issues regarding the availability of alternate accommodation for Sharma. The court has reserved its decision on the matter.

In response to the petition, Khanna denied the allegations of collusion and claimed that he and his family were residing in the property. However, the court found that triable issues were raised regarding alternate accommodation available to the petitioner. The petitioner denied collusion with the respondent and maintained their right to file the eviction petition as a co-owner of the property. The court found that the co-ownership was not challenged and that the petition was admissible. The court also found that the purpose for which the tenanted property was required by the petitioner had been disclosed and that no trial was necessary.

The court considered the growing need for accommodation felt by the petitioner's family and found that the accommodation was scarce, leaving no room/space for the petitioner's two sons. The court concluded that it was not for the tenant to dictate the use of space by the landlord. The petitioner's request for additional space for his family is considered reasonable, but the respondent's grounds for contesting the request are rejected due to lack of evidence. The court also notes that the respondent failed to provide specific details about alternate accommodation available to the petitioner. The court cites previous cases to emphasize that a tenant cannot make generalized assertions without providing evidence to support their claims.

The court order states that a tenant cannot contest an eviction based on generalized descriptions of alternate properties available with the landlord. The tenant must provide specific facts to support their case. The court dismissed the tenant's application seeking leave to contest and passed an eviction order against them for a portion of the property. The petitioner cannot obtain possession of the property for six months as per Section 14(7) of the Delhi Rent Control Act.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between a co-owner of a tenanted property and the tenant who has been occupying the property since 1988. The co-owner filed a petition seeking possession of the property for his growing family's needs, while the tenant sought leave to contest the petition, alleging collusion between the co-owner and his brother. The court found that the co-ownership was not challenged and that the petition was admissible. The court also considered the growing need for accommodation felt by the petitioner's family and found that the accommodation was scarce, leaving no room/space for the petitioner's two sons. The court concluded that it was not for the tenant to dictate the use of space by the landlord. The court dismissed the tenant's application seeking leave to contest and passed an eviction order against them for a portion of the property. The petitioner cannot obtain possession of the property for six months as per Section 14(7) of the Delhi Rent Control Act.
