In a recent court order, the issue at hand was the dismissal of two applications for setting aside an ex-parte judgment and decree. The applications were dismissed in default due to the non-appearance of the counsel. However, the appellant filed applications for restoration of the previous applications, stating that the counsel did not attend the matter due to a bona fide doubt about the listing of the applications.

The court recognized that the party should not suffer due to the inaction or negligence of the counsel and allowed the restoration of the applications. The court held that the appellant had a valid reason for the non-appearance of the counsel and that the party should not be penalized for the same. The court further stated that the restoration of the applications would not cause any prejudice to the other party.

The court directed that the case be determined on merits by the learned Single Judge. This means that the case will be heard and decided based on the evidence and arguments presented by both parties. The court's decision to allow the restoration of the applications ensures that the appellant has a fair chance to present their case and seek justice.

This court order highlights the importance of ensuring that parties are not penalized for the inaction or negligence of their counsel. It also emphasizes the need for courts to consider the reasons behind the non-appearance of counsel before dismissing applications or cases. The court's decision to allow the restoration of the applications ensures that justice is served and that both parties have a fair chance to present their case.
