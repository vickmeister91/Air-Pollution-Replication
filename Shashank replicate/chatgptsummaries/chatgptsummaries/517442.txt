The case in question involves a challenge to the rejection of a mining lease application on 23.21 acres of land in Mouza Dom-chance by the Deputy Commissioner of Kodarma. The petitioner argued that even if the land is considered a forest area, the rejection was not justified as the State Government should have sought prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The court examined the issue of seeking prior approval and found that it was never decided. As a result, the case was remitted to the Deputy Commissioner to redetermine the issue and seek prior approval if necessary. However, an intended intervenor was not allowed to intervene at this stage.

The petitioner's argument was based on the Forest (Conservation) Act, which requires prior approval from the Central Government for any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act was enacted to ensure that forest land is not diverted for non-forest purposes without proper scrutiny and approval.

The court examined the provisions of the Act and found that the State Government had not sought prior approval from the Central Government before rejecting the petitioner's application. The court also noted that the issue of seeking prior approval was never decided by the Deputy Commissioner.

The court's decision to remit the case to the Deputy Commissioner was based on the fact that the issue of seeking prior approval was not decided. The court directed the Deputy Commissioner to redetermine the issue and seek prior approval if necessary.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act. The Act is designed to protect forest land from being diverted for non-forest purposes without proper scrutiny and approval. The court's decision also highlights the need for proper decision-making processes in cases involving forest land.

The court's decision to not allow the intended intervenor to intervene at this stage is also significant. The court's decision suggests that the intervenor did not have a sufficient interest in the case to warrant intervention at this stage.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act and the need for proper decision-making processes in cases involving forest land. The court's decision to remit the case to the Deputy Commissioner to redetermine the issue of seeking prior approval if necessary is a significant step towards ensuring that forest land is protected from being diverted for non-forest purposes without proper scrutiny and approval.
