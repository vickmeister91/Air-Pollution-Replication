The court order pertains to various applications made by the accused in a criminal case, requesting the production of call detail records (CDRs) and other documents. The accused claims that these documents are necessary to prove their innocence and to cross-examine witnesses effectively. The prosecution objects to the applications, arguing that the documents are not relevant or necessary for the case and that the accused cannot claim them as a matter of right. The court conducts a preliminary inquiry and finds that the documents are available and directs the companies to preserve them. The court considers arguments from both sides and cites relevant legal provisions and judgments before making a decision.

In one of the applications, the accused requested the production of CDRs of certain mobile phones. The court conducts a preliminary inquiry and finds that the CDRs are available and directs the companies to preserve them. The prosecution objects to the application, arguing that the CDRs are not relevant or necessary for the case and that the accused cannot claim them as a matter of right. The court considers arguments from both sides and cites relevant legal provisions and judgments before making a decision.

The court notes that the accused has the right to access documents and prepare a defense, even if it means changing their defense during the trial. The court also notes that objections to questions asked during cross-examination can only be made at the time the question is asked, and not in advance. The court ultimately allows the accused's application to summon call detail records for cross-examination purposes.

In another application, the accused requested the production of a document under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court cites previous judgments that support the accused's right to access documents and prepare a defense. The court notes that objections to questions asked during cross-examination can only be made at the time the question is asked, and not in advance. The court ultimately allows the accused's application to summon call detail records for cross-examination purposes.

The court also discusses the applicability of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the context of producing documents as evidence during different stages of a trial. The court cites several judgments, including Sukhmohinder Singh's case and Debendra Nath Padhi's case, which establish that Section 91 cannot be invoked at the stage of framing of the charge. The court also notes that there is no clear guidance on how Section 91 should be used during the stage of prosecution evidence or the defense evidence. The court ultimately concludes that the accused cannot invoke Section 91 prior to the stage when they enter upon their defense and that the accused cannot get produced a document for the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.

In yet another application, the accused requested the production of a document under Section 94 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court discusses the issue of whether a court can call for the production of a document at the request of the accused under Section 94. The Hon'ble Full Bench held that the accused has the right to cross-examine a prosecution witness as to any previous statement made by him in writing or reduced into writing and relevant to matters in question. The accused is entitled to use these documents in the exercise of the right of cross-examination given to him during that stage of his trial. The court can exercise its discretion under Section 94 to call for the production of such documents at the request of the accused, as their production is obviously necessary and desirable for the purpose of the trial.

In conclusion, the court order deals with various applications made by the accused in a criminal case, requesting the production of call detail records and other documents. The court considers arguments from both sides and cites relevant legal provisions and judgments before making a decision. The court notes that the accused has the right to access documents and prepare a defense, even if it means changing their defense during the trial. The court also notes that objections to questions asked during cross-examination can only be made at the time the question is asked, and not in advance. The court ultimately allows the accused's application to summon call detail records for cross-examination purposes. The court also discusses the applicability of Section 91 and Section 94 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the context of producing documents as evidence during different stages of a trial.
