The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to illegal mining activity in protected forest areas in the state of Rajasthan, India. The first order was filed by the Tarun Bharat Sangh, a voluntary organization interested in protecting the environment. The organization filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, complaining of widespread illegal mining activity in the area declared as a Tiger Reserve in Alwar District in the State of Rajasthan. The court issued notices to the State Government and the mine owners and appointed a committee to ensure due observance of the various Acts and Notifications that had been issued in respect of the protected area. The committee identified the areas declared as protected forest and recommended that mining operations in all the listed mines should be stopped forthwith. The State Government and mine owners filed objections, but the court held that the relevant laws were violated, and passed directions to ensure observance of enacted laws made by the State to protect the environment and ecology of the area.

The second court order pertains to illegal mining activity in a protected forest area in Rajasthan, India. The court clarifies that no mining activity is permitted in the protected area, and a committee is appointed to demarcate the boundaries of the protected forest. The committee identifies 262 mines, of which 215 fall completely within the protected forest area, and 47 fall partly within and partly outside it. The committee recommends that mining operations in all 215 mines be stopped immediately, and in the 47 mines to the extent they fall within the protected forest area. The mine owners object to this recommendation and propose that the area covered by the mines be excluded from the protected forest, and an equal extent of area be included in its place. The court directs the Ministry of Environment and Forest to examine the proposal and submit a report within three months. The court also notes that mining activity in the tiger reserve area is prohibited by law, and directs that mining activity in the listed mines situated outside the protected forest area but within the tiger reserve may continue for four months, subject to obtaining permission from the Central Government. If no permission is obtained within four months, mining activity in the entire tiger reserve area shall stop.

The third court order prohibits certain processes and operations without prior permission in specified areas, including new industry location, mining operations, cutting of trees, construction of dwelling units, and electrification. The areas where carrying out these processes without permission is prohibited are listed in a table. The court heard arguments from various parties, including the writ petitioner, the State of Rajasthan, and mine-owners, regarding the violation of laws related to forest conservation and mining leases. The court clarified that it is not a case of balancing interests of economy and ecology but of ensuring observance of enacted laws made by the State to protect the environment and ecology of the area. The court found that the mining activity in the listed mines should stop immediately and that the mine-owners and the Government of Rajasthan should be proceeded against for contempt.

The fourth court order declares that any forest land or waste land not included in a reserve forest but owned by the State Government or over which the State Government has proprietary rights is subject to the provisions of the chapter. The State Government can declare any forest land or waste land as a protected forest, and waste lands can be brought under afforestation schemes. Once declared as a protected forest, the entire area becomes a protected forest, and no non-forest activity can be carried out without prior approval from the Central Government. The grant and renewal of mining leases and licenses in the protected forest areas are illegal, and all mining operations in the listed mines should be stopped immediately. The report of the Justice M.L. Jain Committee is accepted, and the merits of the proposal to delete an extent of 5.02 sq. Km. from the protected forest should be examined by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, and a report submitted to the court within three months.

The fifth court order states that mining activity in certain mines should be stopped immediately, as it is illegal. The Rajasthan government and mine-owners have requested that the area covered by these mines be excluded from the protected forest, but the court has not expressed an opinion on this and has asked for the opinion of the central government. Mining activity in mines within the protected forest must stop, but mining activity in mines outside the protected forest but within the tiger reserve may continue for four months, subject to permission from the central government. If no permission is obtained within four months, mining activity in the entire tiger reserve area must stop. The matter will be reviewed on July 12, 1993.

In summary, all of these court orders pertain to illegal mining activity in protected forest areas in Rajasthan, India. The court has consistently held that mining activity in these areas is illegal and has directed that mining operations in the listed mines be stopped immediately. The court has also appointed committees to demarcate the boundaries of the protected forest and to ensure due observance of the various Acts and Notifications that had been issued in respect of the protected area. The court has directed the Ministry of Environment and Forest to examine proposals to exclude certain areas from the protected forest and to submit reports within three months. The court has also clarified that no non-forest activity can be carried out in protected forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government.
