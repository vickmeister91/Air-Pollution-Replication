The Jammu and Kashmir High Court recently heard a case where the petitioner sought to quash a decision made by the State of J&K and others to award a construction contract for a new Government Polytechnic College in Poonch to J&K Project Construction Corporation Limited. The petitioner also sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the contract from being awarded to the Corporation and a direction to hand over the vacant site to the petitioner. The petitioner also sought compensation for not being given the site for construction.

During the hearing, the court heard arguments from both sides and ordered that the record be produced, warning that an adverse inference would be drawn if it was not. However, the respondents did not file a reply to the writ petition or produce the record, despite being directed to do so. The court drew an adverse inference against them for non-production of the record.

The petitioner's claim pertains to the construction of a Polytechnic College in Banpat Poonch, but the contract for construction has been awarded to the Corporation for a new site, Sartha in Poonch. The court held that the decision to award the contract to the Corporation is arbitrary, irrational, and contrary to public interest. The court quashed the decision and directed the high-level committee to take a well-considered decision within a month.

The Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir has been ordered to make a decision regarding a contract awarded to the petitioner within one month. A high-level committee will hear from both parties and consider public interest and the observations made by the court. The matter pertains to a public project and cannot be delayed. The petition has been disposed of.
