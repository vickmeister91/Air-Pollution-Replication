Mahesh Gundecha, a resident of Mumbai, has filed an anticipatory bail application in connection with a case registered against him under Sections 379 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act. The case was registered against him by the Mumbai Police for allegedly stealing sand from a beach in Mumbai and damaging the environment. The police had also seized a truck and a JCB machine from the spot.

Gundecha had approached the court seeking anticipatory bail, fearing arrest by the police. The court had granted him ad-interim protection on the condition that he attends the police station from 1st April to 9th April. The court had also directed him to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The investigating officer had opposed the anticipatory bail application, stating that the accused had committed a serious offence and that his custodial interrogation was necessary to unearth the truth. The prosecution had also argued that the accused was a habitual offender and had been involved in similar offences in the past.

However, the court had observed that the accused had no criminal antecedents and that he had cooperated with the investigation. The court had also noted that the accused had deposited a sum of Rs. 1 lakh with the court as a surety. The court had, therefore, granted him ad-interim protection and had directed him to attend the police station as per the conditions imposed.

The court had now made the interim order absolute and had allowed the anticipatory bail application. The court had directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The court had also directed the accused to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence. The investigating officer can call him as and when required, but must give 48 hours' written communication to the applicant.

The court had also taken into consideration the fact that the accused was a businessman and that his arrest would cause harm to his business. The court had, therefore, granted him anticipatory bail on the condition that he cooperates with the investigation and attends the police station as per the conditions imposed.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Mahesh Gundecha in connection with a case registered against him under Sections 379 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act.
