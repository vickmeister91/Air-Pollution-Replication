Parvez Khan, the accused in Forest Crime No. 23040/2016 registered at Forest Range Chilwah, Dist Raisen, filed a second bail application under Section 438 of Cr.P.C for anticipatory bail. The offences he is charged with are punishable under Sections 2, 9, 39, 41, 44 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act and Section 26 and 52 of the Indian Forest Act. The first bail application was dismissed, and no change of circumstances was found to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant-accused. Therefore, the application was dismissed.

The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act are two important pieces of legislation that aim to protect wildlife and forests in India. The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds, and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Indian Forest Act, on the other hand, was enacted in 1927 to consolidate and amend the law relating to forests, the transit of forest produce, and the duty leviable on timber and other forest produce.

The offences that Parvez Khan is charged with are serious in nature and carry severe penalties. Section 2 of the Wild Life Protection Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 9 prohibits possession of any captive animal or bird. Section 39 prohibits the hunting of any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act. Section 41 prohibits the sale, purchase, or transport of any wild animal or bird specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act. Section 44 prohibits the destruction, alteration, or diversion of any habitat of any wild animal or bird specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act. Section 52 provides for punishment for offences under the Act.

Similarly, Section 26 of the Indian Forest Act prohibits the felling, girdling, lopping, tapping, or burning of any tree in a reserved forest or a protected forest without the permission of the forest officer. Section 52 provides for punishment for offences under the Act.

In his second bail application, Parvez Khan sought anticipatory bail under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian criminal justice system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect a person from unnecessary harassment and detention by the police. However, the grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the satisfaction of the court that the person seeking bail has not committed the offence, and that he or she is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court, in this case, found that there was no change of circumstances that would warrant the grant of anticipatory bail to Parvez Khan. The court had already dismissed his first bail application, and there was no new evidence or argument presented in the second bail application that would change the court's decision. Therefore, the court dismissed the second bail application as well.

The dismissal of Parvez Khan's bail application highlights the seriousness of the offences he is charged with. The Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act are important pieces of legislation that aim to protect India's wildlife and forests. The enforcement of these laws is crucial to ensure the survival of endangered species and the preservation of India's natural heritage. The court's decision to deny bail to Parvez Khan sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate those who violate these important laws.
