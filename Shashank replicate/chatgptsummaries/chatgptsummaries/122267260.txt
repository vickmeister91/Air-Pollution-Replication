On 13 August 2015, the High Court passed an order in response to three criminal original petitions filed by K.T. Venkateswaran, T.S. Venkateswaran, and K.S. Elango against the State and Indian Bank. The petitioners had filed petitions under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking certain records to prove their innocence. The Court below had dismissed all the petitions, but the High Court allowed them, directing the second respondent to submit the documents mentioned in the petitions and the Court below to dispose of C.C.No.71 of 2001 as per the direction given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

The case pertains to allegations of fraud and cheating against the petitioners, who were accused of misappropriating funds from Indian Bank. The petitioners had sought certain records from the bank to prove their innocence, but their requests were denied by the lower court. The High Court, however, found merit in their petitions and directed the bank to submit the requested documents.

The High Court's order was significant because it allowed the petitioners to access crucial evidence that could prove their innocence. The court recognized the importance of ensuring that all parties have access to relevant documents and information in a criminal case. By directing the bank to submit the requested records, the court ensured that the petitioners would have a fair chance to defend themselves against the charges.

The court's decision also highlighted the importance of following due process in criminal cases. The petitioners had followed the proper legal procedures in seeking the records they needed to defend themselves, but their requests had been denied by the lower court. The High Court's decision to allow their petitions demonstrated that the legal system is designed to protect the rights of all parties involved in a criminal case.

Overall, the High Court's order in this case was a victory for the petitioners and for the principles of justice and due process. By allowing the petitioners to access the records they needed to defend themselves, the court ensured that they would have a fair trial and that justice would be served. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that all parties are treated fairly in the criminal justice system.
