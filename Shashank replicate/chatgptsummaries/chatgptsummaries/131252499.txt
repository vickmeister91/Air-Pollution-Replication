The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mukesh Kumar Meena against the State of Rajasthan and other respondents. The petitioner is seeking relief from a demand notice passed by the Mining Engineer, Banswara, and wants the respondents to be restrained from recovering any other amount towards NPV under the notification dated 01.04.2015 or otherwise. The matter is covered by a previous judgment in M/s. Hari Priya Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.

The petitioner has been undertaking mining activity for the minor serpentine mineral within the mining lease allotted to him, and the land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department.

The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015, mentioning that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in the future, and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the Net Present Value (NPV) from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area.

The court order pertains to the deposit of NPV (Net Present Value) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The NPV for a cluster of land measuring 281 hectares is Rs. 17,59,06,000/-, which has to be deposited in the bank account. The demand for the NPV was raised by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, and the Forest Department has asked for the second installment of the NPV to be deposited before 28.02.2019. The petitioners, who are mining lease holders, have deposited the first installment of the NPV, but they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas, which they claim is contrary to the law.

The court order discusses arguments made by both the petitioners and the respondents in regards to the calculation of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land falling in a mining lease. The petitioners argue that the provisions of NPV should not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected, while the respondents argue that the State Government can relinquish the area of cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested lease holders. The court also references various annexures and guidelines related to forest conservation and cluster mining proposals.

The court order pertains to a case involving 136 mining lease holders in a cluster area of 281 hectares in Udaipur. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The cause of immediate grievance is the demand notice for payment of the amount of Net Present Value (NPV) for extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount towards the individual forest land being held by each lease holder along with their share in the common area for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The rate of NPV amount shall be Rs.6,26,000/- per hectare.

The court order directs that the rate of NPV amount shall be Rs.6,26,000/- per hectare for forest land falling in mining leases that have not been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. However, the forest land falling in the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases shall be excluded from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court also directs the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually and to exclude the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders in the cluster shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mukesh Kumar Meena against the State of Rajasthan and other respondents seeking relief from a demand notice passed by the Mining Engineer, Banswara. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount towards the individual forest land being held by each lease holder along with their share in the common area for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, and the dumping area. The rate of NPV amount shall be Rs.6,26,000/- per hectare. The forest land falling in the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases shall be excluded from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV. The court has also directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually and to exclude the 62 mining leases which have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed
