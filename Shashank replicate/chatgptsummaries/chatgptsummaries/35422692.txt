The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in a criminal appeal filed by Sanay Gandhi Animal Care Centre against the State of Delhi and Rashid Khan. The revisionist claimed that the respondent was flouting animal welfare laws and was arrested with 50 sparrows, 11 rabbits, 10 pigeons, and 21 rats in his possession. The animals were in critical condition and were brought to the care center for treatment. The accused was convicted and later moved an application for taking the case property on superdari, which was allowed by the trial court. 

The revisionist claimed that the animals were not in a fit condition to be released and that birds cannot be captivated in cages. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the case property to be released to the owner. The court observed that the animals were in a fit condition to be released and that the care center had not produced any evidence to suggest otherwise. The court also noted that the care center had not followed the procedure laid down under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, which requires the care center to inform the police and the magistrate about the animals in their possession.

The court further observed that the care center had not produced any evidence to suggest that the animals were being kept in cages. The court noted that the care center had not provided any details about the size of the cages or the conditions in which the animals were being kept. The court also observed that the care center had not produced any evidence to suggest that the animals were being mistreated or subjected to any kind of cruelty.

The court held that the revisionist had failed to make out a case for the animals to be kept in the care center and that the case property should be released to the owner. The court also directed the care center to follow the procedure laid down under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in future cases.

This judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of following the procedure laid down under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in cases involving animals. The Act lays down detailed procedures for the treatment and care of animals and requires care centers to inform the police and the magistrate about the animals in their possession. The Act also lays down guidelines for the size of cages and the conditions in which animals can be kept.

The judgment also highlights the need for care centers to provide evidence to support their claims about the condition of animals in their possession. The court observed that the care center had not provided any evidence to suggest that the animals were being mistreated or subjected to any kind of cruelty. This underscores the importance of providing evidence to support claims in court.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's judgment in the criminal appeal filed by Sanay Gandhi Animal Care Centre against the State of Delhi and Rashid Khan is a significant one. The judgment highlights the importance of following the procedure laid down under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in cases involving animals.
