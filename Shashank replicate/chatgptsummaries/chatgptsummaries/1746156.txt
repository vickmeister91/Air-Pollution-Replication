The court order in question pertains to a case between M.C. Mehta and the Union of India regarding the conversion of an area in Shamshabad and Fatehabad into a non-pollution light industrial zone. The State of U.P. has agreed to keep an area of 89.87 hectares as a "green zone" and adhere to the norms prescribed by Agra Development Authority for temporary construction. The court has directed the competent authority to remove any unauthorized construction and prohibited the use of land less than 5 acres for any purpose other than a green park.

The court has laid down several conditions that must be met in order for the project to proceed. The national ambient air quality standards must be maintained, and the construction activity should not exceed 10% of the total area. The complex must have provisions for eco-friendly utility backup, water/waste water-recycling facility, and solid waste management systems. The water recharge areas must be identified and protected, and a part of the earning/entrance fee shall be utilized for the upkeep of the surrounding infrastructure around Taj Mahal.

The project proponent must obtain necessary consent from the U.P. State Pollution Control Board and abide by any conditions/stipulations imposed by the appropriate authority. These conditions would be applicable to all other persons who apply for such permission in the future.

The court order is significant as it seeks to balance the need for economic development with environmental concerns.
