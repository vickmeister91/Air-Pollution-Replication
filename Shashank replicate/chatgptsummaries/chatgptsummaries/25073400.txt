The Karnataka High Court recently issued an order quashing a decision made by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) on November 15, 2018. The KSPCB had withdrawn the consent issued under Section 21(4) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, to M/s. Srinivas Prasad Stone Crusher. The court found that the KSPCB had passed the order without extending any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and only with reference to the recommendation made by the Hon'ble Upa Lokayuktha. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the KSPCB had not given the petitioner a chance to be heard before making their decision. The court found that this was a violation of the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing before any decision is made. The court also noted that the KSPCB had relied solely on the recommendation of the Hon'ble Upa Lokayuktha, without conducting any independent investigation or inquiry into the matter.

The court's order requires that if any order adverse to the interest of the petitioner is proposed to be passed in the future, the KSPCB must serve a specific show cause notice to the petitioner with the specific ground, which the petitioner is required to meet. This means that the KSPCB must provide the petitioner with a clear explanation of why they are proposing to take a particular action, and give the petitioner an opportunity to respond to those reasons.

The court's decision is significant because it reinforces the importance of the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making. It also highlights the need for regulatory bodies like the KSPCB to conduct independent investigations and inquiries before making decisions that could have a significant impact on the rights and interests of individuals and businesses.

Overall, the court's order is a reminder that administrative decision-making must be fair, transparent, and based on sound evidence and reasoning. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that all parties are given a fair hearing before any decision is made, and that regulatory bodies like the KSPCB are held accountable for their actions.
