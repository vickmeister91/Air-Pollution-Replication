The court order pertains to two separate petitions filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The first petition was filed by Mayank Sharma against Vishal Sharma, while the second petition was dismissed as being wholly misconceived.

Mayank Sharma had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for production of income tax return of the complainant in a case filed against him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The application was rejected by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bhopal. Mayank Sharma had filed the petition against this order.

The court observed that the powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India can be invoked only when the powers are exercised by the District Courts without jurisdiction or in excess their jurisdiction. The court also laid down the principles on the exercise of the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution.

The court emphasized that the power of the High Court under Article 227 to maintain administrative and judicial control over the administration of justice within its territory is discretionary and should be exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases to promote public confidence in the administration of justice. The power should not be used to influence the subordinate judiciary to pass any order or judgment in a particular manner.

In the case of Mayank Sharma, the court found that the application for production of income tax return was not maintainable under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court held that the power under Section 91 can only be exercised by the court and not by the accused. Therefore, the petition filed by Mayank Sharma was dismissed.

In the second petition, the court dismissed the petition as being wholly misconceived and ordered the petitioner to pay a cost of Rs.1000/- to the District Legal Services Authority. The court emphasized that the power under Article 227 should not be used to file frivolous petitions and waste the time of the court.

The court order highlights the importance of the power of the High Court under Article 227 to maintain administrative and judicial control over the administration of justice within its territory. The power should be exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases to promote public confidence in the administration of justice. The court also emphasizes that the power should not be used to influence the subordinate judiciary to pass any order or judgment in a particular manner.

In conclusion, the court order provides guidance on the exercise of the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The power should be used judiciously and only in appropriate cases to promote public confidence in the administration of justice. The court also emphasizes that the power should not be used to file frivolous petitions and waste the time of the court.
