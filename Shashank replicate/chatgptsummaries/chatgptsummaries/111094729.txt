The order states that compliance has been made in all three medical colleges and the hospital, and as a result, the petition is disposed of.

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection and improvement of the environment. The Act empowers the central government to take measures to protect and improve the environment, and to prevent and control pollution.

The court order is significant because it highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, particularly in the healthcare sector. Healthcare facilities generate a significant amount of bio-medical waste, which can be hazardous to human health and the environment if not managed and disposed of properly. The Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, provide for the safe and scientific disposal of bio-medical waste, and compliance with these rules is essential to prevent the spread of infections and diseases.

The court order also underscores the role of the state government in ensuring compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The three medical colleges run by the State of Assam and Mohendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital are public institutions, and as such, they have a responsibility to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The state government has a duty to ensure that these institutions are complying with the law, and the court order is a testament to the government's efforts in this regard.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to compliance with the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 in three medical colleges run by the State of Assam and Mohendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital is a significant development in the field of environmental law.
