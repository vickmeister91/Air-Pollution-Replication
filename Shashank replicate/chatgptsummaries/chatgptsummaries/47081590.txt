The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Yelle Venkata Rao and others against the State of Andhra Pradesh. The petitioners had raised concerns about the proposed establishment of a facility called 'Chetta Nunchi Sampada', which they claimed would breach their fundamental right to fresh air and water. The court directed respondent No. 5 to look into the representation, conduct an inquiry with all stakeholders, and take steps for abatement of pollution from the facility.

The court order also granted the petitioners the liberty to re-submit their representation within four weeks, and directed the respondents to take all necessary steps for prevention, abatement, and control of pollution within six weeks. The operation of the facility would be closed if it did not conform to the Environment (Protection) Act read with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The court did not award any costs, and any pending miscellaneous petitions were closed.

The court's decision to direct respondent No. 5 to conduct an inquiry with all stakeholders is significant, as it indicates that the court is taking a holistic approach to the issue of pollution from the proposed facility. By involving all stakeholders in the inquiry, the court is ensuring that the concerns of all parties are taken into account, and that the final decision is based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

The court's decision to grant the petitioners the liberty to re-submit their representation within four weeks is also noteworthy, as it indicates that the court is open to considering new evidence or arguments that may be presented by the petitioners. This is an important safeguard for ensuring that the court's decision is based on the most up-to-date and accurate information available.

The court's directive to the respondents to take all necessary steps for prevention, abatement, and control of pollution within six weeks is a clear indication of the court's commitment to protecting the environment and the health of the local population. This directive is in line with the principles of sustainable development, which emphasize the need to balance economic development with environmental protection and social well-being.

The court's decision to close any pending miscellaneous petitions is also significant, as it indicates that the court is taking a proactive approach to resolving the issue of pollution from the proposed facility. By closing any pending petitions, the court is ensuring that all parties are focused on finding a solution to the problem at hand, rather than engaging in legal wrangling or other distractions.

Overall, the court order issued in response to the writ petition filed by Yelle Venkata Rao and others against the State of Andhra Pradesh is a positive development for environmental protection and sustainable development in the region. The court's decision to involve all stakeholders in the inquiry, grant the petitioners the liberty to re-submit their representation, and direct the respondents to take all necessary steps for prevention, abatement, and control of pollution within a specific timeframe, demonstrates the court's commitment to finding a fair and equitable solution to the issue at hand.
