The Delhi High Court issued three court orders in different cases, which are summarized below.

In the first case, Ved Vrat Sharma filed a suit against Auto Needs (I) Private Limited seeking possession of an industrial plot and a decree for arrears of rent and damages. The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the property and had given it to the defendant for industrial purposes. However, the defendant was irregular in paying the license fee and had stopped paying altogether. The court appointed a Local Commissioner to visit the premises and take possession of the property. The defendant claimed ownership of certain items found on the premises, but the court ultimately handed over possession to the plaintiff. This order highlights the importance of paying license fees on time and the consequences of not doing so.

In the second case, there was a dispute between a plaintiff and defendant over a leased property. The defendant claimed ownership of certain items found on the premises, but the plaintiff was given possession of the property. The defendant filed a counter claim alleging that the plaintiff's actions caused them to suffer losses. However, the court found that the counter claim was based on false allegations and rejected it. The court also dismissed the defendant's application to amend their written statement. The plaintiff's application for license fee/rent was granted as there was no dispute over the rate. This order highlights the importance of providing truthful evidence and the consequences of making false allegations.

In the third case, there was a dispute over the rate of license fee/rent for a property. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant vacated the property in July 2010, while the defendant claimed that the plaintiff forcibly took over the property in September 2009. The court ordered the defendant to deposit the license fee/rent calculated at Rs. 1,50,000 per month from September 2008 to September 2009 in court within four weeks. The deposit will be kept in a fixed deposit in a bank for six months, and the court will decide whether the plaintiff is entitled to disbursement of the deposited amount or not. The defendant is directed to comply with the order within two weeks, and the case is listed for framing of issues on November 20, 2013. This order highlights the importance of providing accurate evidence and the consequences of not doing so.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of paying license fees on time, providing truthful evidence, and providing accurate evidence. Failure to do so can result in adverse consequences, such as losing possession of a property or being ordered to pay a deposit. It is important for individuals and businesses to understand their legal obligations and to comply with them to avoid legal disputes and adverse court orders.
