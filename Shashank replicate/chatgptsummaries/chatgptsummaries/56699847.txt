The Delhi State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) filed a lawsuit against JMC Associated-JV for failing to complete the construction of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant as per the agreement. The plaintiff sought to recover Rs. 21,67,389/- from the defendant, who had submitted bank guarantees as performance security and mobilization advance but failed to complete the work and did not extend the bank guarantees. The contract was finally rescinded by the plaintiff, and the suit was filed for recovery of the amount. The judgment was pronounced on 20th November 2018.

In another lawsuit filed by DSIIDC against JMC Associated-JV, the defendant contested the suit, claiming to have completed work amounting to Rs. 134,00,000 and demanding Rs. 52,00,000 in outstanding payments. The defendant also claimed to have faced difficulties in completing the contract and incurred losses due to the plaintiff's failure to resolve issues. The plaintiff presented evidence in support of its case, including copies of the contract and bank guarantees. The court settled four issues, and the case is ongoing.

In a third case filed by DSIIDC against JMC Associated-JV, the plaintiff sought to recover Rs. 21,67,389/- along with interest. The court examined various documents and testimonies of witnesses and found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount from the defendant. The defendant failed to lead any evidence in support of its plea and was found liable to pay damages. The court also dismissed the defendant's plea that the contract was not executable due to an injunction order passed in the district court.

The court found no evidence to support the defendant's claim of being misled by the plaintiff and decreed in favor of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 21,67,389/- along with interest and costs. The decree sheet is to be prepared accordingly, and the file will be consigned to the record room after due compliance. This was announced in open court on November 20, 2018.

In summary, DSIIDC filed three lawsuits against JMC Associated-JV for failing to complete the construction of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant, failing to pay for work done, and recovery of a sum of Rs. 21,67,389/- along with interest. The court found in favor of DSIIDC in all three cases and decreed that JMC Associated-JV pay damages and costs. The cases were heard on November 20, 2018, and the decree sheet is to be prepared accordingly.
