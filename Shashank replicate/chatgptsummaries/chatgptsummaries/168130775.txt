Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala had filed a criminal revision against the judgment passed in Crl.M.P.No.3020 of 2006, in C.C.No.2826 of 2004, on the file of the XVIIth Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai dated 21.11.2007. The case was filed against the petitioner and two others under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had filed a petition stating that he is an innocent person and someone has dragged him into the case by way of forging his signature in the alleged said cheque which has not been duly signed by him on behalf of the 1st accused namely, M/s.Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The Magistrate had dismissed the petition, and the 3rd accused had filed a revision. The court had declined to set aside the trial court order, and the revision was dismissed.

The case in question was filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques. The petitioner, Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala, had been accused along with two others of dishonouring a cheque issued on behalf of M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The petitioner had claimed that he was innocent and that his signature had been forged on the cheque. He had filed a petition to this effect, but the Magistrate had dismissed it. The third accused had then filed a revision, which was also dismissed by the court.

The court's decision to dismiss the revision was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged. The court had also noted that the petitioner had not denied his association with M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited, which was the first accused in the case. The court had therefore concluded that the petitioner was not an innocent person who had been falsely implicated in the case.

The court's decision was in line with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which holds all signatories to a cheque equally responsible for its dishonour. The Act also provides for a presumption of guilt in cases where a cheque has been dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account. The burden of proof is on the accused to prove that the cheque was not dishonoured due to insufficient funds or that he had no knowledge of the insufficiency.

In this case, the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged. He had also not denied his association with the first accused, M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The court had therefore concluded that he was equally responsible for the dishonour of the cheque.

The court's decision highlights the importance of maintaining proper records and ensuring that all transactions are properly documented. It also underscores the need for individuals to exercise caution when signing cheques or other financial instruments. Any irregularities or discrepancies should be immediately reported to the concerned authorities to avoid being implicated in any fraudulent activities.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the revision filed by Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala was based on the fact that he had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged on the cheque in question. The court had also noted that he had not denied his association with the first accused, M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The decision highlights the importance of maintaining proper records and exercising caution when signing financial instruments.
