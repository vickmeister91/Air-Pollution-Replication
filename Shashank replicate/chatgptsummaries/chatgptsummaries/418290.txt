The court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Kumara against the State of Karnataka. Kumara had been convicted of the offense of forcible sexual intercourse and had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000. Kumara had appealed against this judgment, arguing that there was no evidence of forcible sexual intercourse. However, the court rejected Kumara's appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence, stating that there was ample evidence to support the victim's complaint and the trial court's decision.

The court, in its order, observed that the victim had testified that Kumara had forcibly had sexual intercourse with her. The victim had also stated that she had tried to resist Kumara's advances but had been overpowered by him. The court noted that the victim's testimony was corroborated by medical evidence, which showed that she had sustained injuries consistent with sexual assault. The court also observed that Kumara had not denied having sexual intercourse with the victim but had claimed that it was consensual.

The court, however, rejected Kumara's claim of consensual sex, stating that the victim had clearly stated that she had not consented to the sexual intercourse. The court also noted that Kumara had not produced any evidence to support his claim of consensual sex. The court, therefore, held that there was ample evidence to support the victim's complaint and the trial court's decision.

Kumara had also argued that the trial court had not considered certain evidence in his favor. However, the court observed that the trial court had considered all the evidence presented before it and had arrived at a reasoned decision. The court, therefore, held that there was no merit in Kumara's argument.

The court, in its order, also observed that sexual offenses were a serious crime and needed to be dealt with severely. The court noted that the offense committed by Kumara was a grave one and warranted a severe punishment. The court, therefore, upheld the sentence of seven years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000.
