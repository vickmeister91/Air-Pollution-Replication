On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, which pertained to several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land. The court order listed multiple cases (CWP Nos.) with their respective petitioners and respondents. The cases involved individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India.

The court noted that while the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land. The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court noted that some of the encroachers were proprietors of the village, while others were landless and homeless.

The court refrained from expressing any views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directed the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and the authorities were directed to take a holistic view of the matter. The court clarified that the decision would be subject to judicial review and until then, status quo shall be maintained.
