The case of GHCL vs State of Gujarat revolves around allegations of breach of environmental regulations. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the main allegation was a breach of a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The company had applied for clearance under this notification, but there were still allegations of violations of the Air Act and Water Act.

The court granted interim relief and set a date for further proceedings. This means that the company can continue its operations for the time being, but the case will continue to be heard in court. The respondent, in this case, the State of Gujarat, was permitted to take action under other laws if necessary. This means that if the state finds any other violations of environmental regulations, they can take action against the company under those laws.
