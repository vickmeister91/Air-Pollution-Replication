The Gujarat High Court recently quashed and set aside an order passed by a learned Judicial Magistrate and an Additional Sessions Judge in a criminal case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against Devjibhai Lavabhai Gondalia and two others for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The accused had been discharged on the ground that the petitioner who filed the complaint was not authorized to do so. The High Court allowed the petition and directed the Magistrate to proceed further with the case in accordance with the law and on merits.

The case in question pertains to an alleged violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by Devjibhai Lavabhai Gondalia and two others. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused, alleging that they had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby water body, thereby causing pollution. The complaint was filed by a Junior Environmental Engineer of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, who was not authorized to do so under the provisions of the Act.

The accused had challenged the complaint on the ground that it was not filed by an authorized person. The learned Judicial Magistrate had accepted this contention and discharged the accused. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had then filed a revision petition before the Additional Sessions Judge, who had also upheld the order of the Magistrate.

The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had then approached the High Court, challenging the orders of the Magistrate and the Additional Sessions Judge. The High Court, after hearing the parties, allowed the petition and set aside the orders of the lower courts. The High Court held that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 did not require that the complaint be filed only by an authorized person. The High Court further held that the Junior Environmental Engineer was competent to file the complaint, and that the orders of the lower courts were therefore erroneous.

The High Court directed the Magistrate to proceed further with the case in accordance with the law and on merits. The accused will now have to face trial on the charges of violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The decision of the High Court is significant as it clarifies the position of law with respect to the filing of complaints under the Act. The decision will also have a deterrent effect on those who violate the provisions of the Act, as it sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate such violations.

In conclusion, the decision of the Gujarat High Court in quashing and setting aside the orders of the lower courts in the case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against Devjibhai Lavabhai Gondalia and two others for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is a welcome one. The decision clarifies the position of law with respect to the filing of complaints under the Act and sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate violations of its provisions. The accused will now have to face trial on the charges against them, and justice will be served.
