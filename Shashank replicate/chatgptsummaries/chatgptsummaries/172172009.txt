In the state of Kerala, India, a court order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by T.M. Fathimma Beevi and M.M. Mohammed Hazeer against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and other respondents. The petitioners submitted various exhibits, including licenses and consent letters, to support their case. The court heard the case on February 11, 2015, and the exhibits were entered into the record. However, the order does not provide any information on the outcome of the case.

Another court order discusses a writ petition challenging the closure of a rubber processing unit in Alappuzha District. The closure was ordered by the Pollution Control Board due to the unit's disposal of untreated serum into water bodies, causing contamination. The petitioners argue that they had valid licenses and consents to operate the unit and that the closure was illegal and violated natural justice. The respondent argues that the unit was being run without valid consent and causing environmental harm. The National Green Tribunal is also involved in the case.

The court order states that the National Green Tribunal is considering the right to run the petitioner's unit and the petitioners have already entered appearance. The Pollution Control Board implemented closure of the unit as per the Tribunal's directions. The court dismissed the writ petition without prejudice to the petitioner's rights to pursue the matter before the National Green Tribunal. The petitioners did not produce any document to show that they have a valid consent to operate as of the date of the order.

In summary, the court orders pertain to two separate writ petitions filed against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and other respondents. The first petitioners submitted various exhibits to support their case, but the outcome of the case is not provided in the order. The second petition challenges the closure of a rubber processing unit due to environmental harm caused by the disposal of untreated serum into water bodies. The National Green Tribunal is involved in the case, and the court dismissed the writ petition without prejudice to the petitioner's rights to pursue the matter before the Tribunal. The petitioners did not produce any document to show that they have a valid consent to operate as of the date of the order.
