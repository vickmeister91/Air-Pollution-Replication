The Patna High Court recently granted provisional anticipatory bail to Bhim Prasad, who was accused of running a mobile brick kiln without paying taxes. The bail was granted for a period of three months, subject to certain conditions. Prasad was required to pay the due taxes within three months and furnish a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The court made it clear that the bail would be confirmed only if the taxes were paid within the given time.

The case against Prasad was related to his alleged failure to pay taxes on a mobile brick kiln that he was operating. The authorities had claimed that Prasad had not paid the taxes for several years, and had also failed to respond to the notices sent to him in this regard. As a result, a case was filed against him under the relevant provisions of the law.

Prasad had approached the Patna High Court seeking anticipatory bail in the case. He had argued that he was not aware of the tax liability, and that he had not received any notice from the authorities. He had also claimed that he was willing to pay the taxes, but needed some time to arrange the funds.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both sides, granted provisional anticipatory bail to Prasad. The court noted that Prasad had no previous criminal record, and that he had cooperated with the authorities during the investigation. The court also took into account the fact that Prasad had expressed his willingness to pay the taxes.

However, the court also made it clear that the bail would be confirmed only if Prasad paid the taxes within the given time. The court directed Prasad to pay the taxes within three months, and to furnish a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The court also directed Prasad to cooperate with the authorities during the investigation.

The decision of the Patna High Court in this case highlights the importance of complying with the tax laws. The court has made it clear that non-payment of taxes can lead to serious consequences, including criminal prosecution. The court has also emphasized the need for individuals to be aware of their tax liabilities, and to respond to the notices sent to them by the authorities.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted provisional anticipatory bail to Bhim Prasad, subject to the condition that he pays the due taxes within three months and furnishes a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The court has made it clear that the bail will be confirmed only if the taxes are paid within the given time. This case highlights the importance of complying with the tax laws, and the consequences of non-payment of taxes.
