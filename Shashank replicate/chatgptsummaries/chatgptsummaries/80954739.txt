The case was related to a cheque that had been issued by the petitioner, which had bounced due to insufficient funds. The complainant had then filed a case against the petitioner and two others under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had claimed that his signature on the cheque had been forged by someone else, and had filed a petition to summon a handwriting expert to examine and compare the writing in the case with reference to his signature.

However, the Magistrate had dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged. The third accused had then filed a revision, which was also dismissed by the court.

The court held that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged. The court also noted that the petitioner had not raised this issue earlier in the case, and had only done so after the trial had already begun. The court held that the petitioner's petition to summon a handwriting expert was therefore not maintainable, and dismissed the revision.
