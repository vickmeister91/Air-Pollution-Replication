The National Green Tribunal recently dismissed an appeal filed by M/S Maltose Agro Products against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appellant had requested the records concerning the application for consent and to set aside the closure direction issued in the proceedings. However, the appeal was dismissed due to the non-representation of the appellant or their counsel in the last two hearings.

The case involved M/S Maltose Agro Products, a company that had applied for consent to operate a distillery unit in Karnataka. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had issued a closure direction against the company for non-compliance with environmental norms. The company had then filed an appeal before the National Green Tribunal, seeking the records related to the application for consent and the closure direction issued by the Board.

The National Green Tribunal, in its order, noted that the appellant had failed to appear before the Tribunal or to engage a counsel in the last two hearings. The Tribunal observed that the appellant had been given sufficient opportunities to present their case and that the non-appearance of the appellant or their counsel was a deliberate attempt to delay the proceedings. The Tribunal also noted that the appellant had not filed any application for adjournment or sought any relief from the Tribunal.

The Tribunal further observed that the appellant had not complied with the directions issued by the Tribunal in the earlier hearings. The Tribunal had directed the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs as a pre-condition for the hearing of the appeal. However, the appellant had failed to comply with this direction. The Tribunal also noted that the appellant had not filed any affidavit or document to support their case.

The Tribunal, therefore, dismissed the appeal filed by M/S Maltose Agro Products against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The Tribunal observed that the appellant had failed to make out a case for interference with the closure direction issued by the Board. The Tribunal also noted that the appellant had not complied with the directions issued by the Tribunal and had deliberately delayed the proceedings.

The order of the National Green Tribunal highlights the importance of compliance with the directions issued by the Tribunal and the need for parties to engage a counsel to represent them in the proceedings. The Tribunal has also sent a strong message to parties that non-appearance or non-compliance with the directions of the Tribunal will not be tolerated and will result in the dismissal of the appeal. The order also emphasizes the need for companies to comply with environmental norms and regulations to avoid closure directions and other penalties.
