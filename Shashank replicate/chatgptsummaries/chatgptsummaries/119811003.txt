Hilal Ahmad Wani, a resident of Srinagar, was convicted of possessing 24 shawls made of Tibetan Antelope without a permit or license, which is a violation of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or possession of any animal listed in Schedule I, II, III, and IV of the Act. The Tibetan Antelope is listed in Schedule I of the Act, which means it is a highly endangered species and is protected under the Act.

Wani was arrested by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) in 2015, after they received a tip-off about his possession of the shawls. The shawls were seized from his possession, and he was charged under Section 49-B of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, which deals with the possession of any animal listed in Schedule I or Part II of Schedule II of the Act.

During the trial, Wani pleaded not guilty and claimed that he had purchased the shawls from a local dealer and was not aware that they were made of Tibetan Antelope. However, the court rejected his defense and found him guilty of the offense. He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000, which was reduced to Rs. 5,000 on appeal.

Wani filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. However, the court dismissed the appeal and ordered Wani to be taken into custody. The court observed that the offense committed by Wani was a serious one and that the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 was enacted to protect the wildlife of the country. The court also noted that the possession of Tibetan Antelope shawls was a lucrative business, and people like Wani were involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products.

The court's decision to uphold Wani's conviction and sentence sends a strong message to those involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products. The Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 is a crucial legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and biodiversity. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves, and also regulates the hunting, killing, and possession of wildlife.

The illegal trade of wildlife products is a global problem that threatens the survival of many species. The demand for wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn, and tiger bones has led to the poaching and killing of thousands of animals every year. The illegal trade is also linked to organized crime and terrorism, and has a significant impact on the environment and local communities.

In India, the illegal trade of wildlife products is a major problem, and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) has been established to combat the problem. The WCCB is a statutory body that works under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and is responsible for the enforcement of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.

The conviction and sentence of Hilal Ahmad Wani is a significant achievement for the WCCB and sends a strong message to those involved in the illegal trade of wildlife products. The court's decision to uphold the conviction and sentence also highlights the importance of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and the need to protect the country's wildlife and biodiversity.
