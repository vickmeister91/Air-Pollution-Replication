The National Green Tribunal heard Application No. 43/2013 (WZ) filed by Asim Sarode and others against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and the State of Maharashtra. The hearing took place on September 6, 2014, and the judgment was delivered on the same day. The applicants filed the application under Sections 14(1)(2) and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The court order pertains to an application filed under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, regarding the unauthorized and unscientific burning of tires, which emit toxic gases and pollutants affecting the environment and human life. The applicants seek a ban on such burning and urge regulatory agencies to frame suitable rules and regulations to prevent the misuse of old tires. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is the regulatory authority, and it has filed two affidavits proposing suitable guidelines and regulations for tire re-treading and recycling industries. MPCB has recommended the state government to take necessary actions to prevent tire burning in open atmosphere as it generates highly toxic, mutagenic, and hazardous emissions.

The court order discusses the issue of burning used tires in open atmosphere, which generates toxic and hazardous emissions. The court considers whether this practice poses a threat to human health and whether current used tire management practices comply with regulations. The court notes that there is a need for a systemic approach to deal with the problem of used tire disposal, as there is no data available about the total number of used tires generated and their end uses. The court suggests adopting a "Life Cycle Approach" to encourage recycling and reusing of used tires.

The court order states that there is a need for a holistic approach to deal with the issue of used tyre disposal, taking into consideration pollution potential, technology options, viability, and social implications. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is required to conduct a scientific study on used tyre generation and disposal practices to formulate a long-term strategy. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Air (P&CP) Act, 1981 provide powers to the Central and State Governments and Pollution Boards to take measures to protect and improve the environment and issue directions to comply with them. The entire state of Maharashtra has already been declared an Air Pollution area, and the Boards have powers to give directions to regulate the use of fuel and restrict burning of any material.

The court order states that Maharashtra has been declared an air pollution area and the boards have the power to give directions to any person, officer or authority to comply with the provisions of the Environment Protection Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. The court also recommends that the state environment department take a decision on the proposal to ban burning of tires in open places and to regulate the use of used tires in categories 2 and 3. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is directed to undertake a scientific study for Life Cycle Assessment of used tires in Maharashtra and to explore innovative approaches for effective collection and disposal of used tires. The court also expects the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to explore the need and possibility of framing separate regulations on the lines of battery rules and e-waste Rules in the next six months.

The court order prohibits the burning of tires in open areas and public places due to potential air pollution and health hazards. The police, district administration, and urban local bodies must ensure compliance, and defiance will be treated as an offense. The Department of Environment and MPCB will conduct a study on the disposal of used tires and create guidelines for environmentally sound practices. The reuse of used tires as fuel without permission and necessary pollution control systems is prohibited. The MPCB and state environment department must bring awareness to the environmental effects of tire burning. The application is disposed of with no costs.

In summary, the National Green Tribunal heard an application regarding the unauthorized and unscientific burning of tires, which emit toxic gases and pollutants affecting the environment and human life. The court ordered a ban on such burning and urged regulatory agencies to frame suitable rules and regulations to prevent the misuse of old tires. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) was directed to undertake a scientific study for Life Cycle Assessment of used tires in Maharashtra and to explore innovative approaches for effective collection and disposal of used tires. The court also prohibited the burning of tires in open areas and public places due to potential air pollution and health hazards. The MPCB and state environment department were directed to bring awareness to the environmental effects of tire burning.
