The court order in question relates to a bail application made by two individuals who were accused in a case registered under the Arms Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The court notes that the accused have been in custody for a period of 20 days due to their failure to appear in court, which has resulted in a delay of two years in the trial proceedings. 

The court directs the trial court to reconsider the bail application made by the accused, taking into account the period of detention and the fact that they were put behind bars only for default in appearance. The court observes that the accused have been in custody for a relatively short period of time and that their detention was not due to the commission of any serious offence. 

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is based on the principle that pre-trial detention should be used sparingly and only in cases where it is absolutely necessary. The court notes that the accused have not been charged with any serious offence and that their detention was solely due to their failure to appear in court. 

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is also based on the fact that they have been in custody for a relatively short period of time.

The court notes that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and that any delay in the trial proceedings must be justified by compelling reasons. 

In light of these observations, the court directs the trial court to consider the bail application made by the accused again, taking into account the period of detention and the fact that they were put behind bars only for default in appearance. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is a reminder that pre-trial detention should be used sparingly and only in cases where it is absolutely necessary.
