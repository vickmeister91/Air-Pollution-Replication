The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Narmada Raikwar against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The applicants in this case were convicted for entering a sanctuary for the purpose of hunting fish and were sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. The revision was filed only on the point of sentence, and the court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by the applicants in jail.

The court's decision to reduce the sentence was based on the fact that the applicants had already spent a significant amount of time in jail. The court recognized that the purpose of imprisonment is not only to punish the offender but also to reform them. In this case, the applicants had already undergone a significant amount of punishment, and the court felt that further imprisonment would not serve any useful purpose.

However, the court did affirm the fine amount with a default stipulation clause. This means that if the applicants fail to deposit the fine amount, they will be subject to further legal action. The court's decision to affirm the fine amount was based on the fact that the applicants had committed a serious offense by entering a sanctuary for the purpose of hunting fish. The court felt that a fine was an appropriate punishment for this offense.

The court also directed that the applicants be released immediately from jail upon depositing the fine amount. This was done to ensure that the applicants did not have to spend any more time in jail than was necessary. The court recognized that imprisonment can have a significant impact on an individual's life and wanted to minimize this impact as much as possible.

Finally, the court ordered that the record of the trial court be sent back to the concerned court below for compliance and necessary action. This was done to ensure that the court's decision was implemented properly and that the applicants were released from jail as soon as possible.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court recognized the seriousness of the offense committed by the applicants but also recognized the importance of rehabilitation and reform. The court's decision to reduce the sentence and affirm the fine amount with a default stipulation clause was a balanced and fair decision that took into account the interests of both the applicants and society as a whole.
