The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by M/S Gokulam Blue Metals against an order by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to immediately close their stone crushing plant due to various violations. The expert committee appointed by the Tribunal found that the unit had complied with air pollution control measures and had planted trees, but did not have a scheme for measuring ambient air quality. The expert recommended the construction of a metalled road and stipulating daily crusher capacity. The Tribunal allowed the appeal and set aside the order of closure.

However, the court order requires M/s. Gokulam Blue Metals to follow certain recommendations made by an expert to prevent air pollution. These include constructing a metal/paved road, providing a buffer zone of at least 200m, and replacing a wind-breaking net with a 7m high combination of masonry and dust arresting net. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is directed to consider the effect of crusher capacity on a daily basis and monthly basis and to appoint an Action Group to study the same. The Board's proceedings dated 2.7.2004 are to be made applicable to the Appellant unit, and the unit must comply with the above directions within four months. The parties are to bear their own costs.
