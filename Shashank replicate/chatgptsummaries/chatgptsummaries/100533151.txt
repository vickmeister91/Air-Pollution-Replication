The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against the rejection of an application filed by the applicant under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The applicant was facing trial for various offences and had sought to produce certain documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. However, the Trial Court rejected the application on the ground that the document sought to be produced was not relevant at that stage and the applicant could file an application at the defence stage.

The petitioner, dissatisfied with the Trial Court's decision, approached the High Court by way of a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The High Court referred to a Supreme Court judgment and held that the documents sought by the applicant were not relevant at the present stage and could be produced at an appropriate stage. The petition was dismissed.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the relevance of documents in a trial and the appropriate stage at which they should be produced. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court has the discretion to reject such an application if it deems the document or thing sought to be irrelevant or unnecessary at that stage.

In this case, the Trial Court exercised its discretion and rejected the application on the ground that the document sought to be produced was not relevant at that stage. The High Court, in its order, referred to a Supreme Court judgment which held that the documents sought by the applicant were not relevant at the present stage and could be produced at an appropriate stage.

The Supreme Court, in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, has held that the power under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only when the document or thing sought is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court further held that the relevance of the document or thing sought should be determined by the court at the time of the application and not at a later stage.

The court also observed that the power under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. should not be used as a tool for fishing or roving inquiry. The court held that the document or thing sought should have a direct nexus with the case and should be necessary for the just decision of the case.

In light of the above, it is important for litigants to understand the relevance of documents in a trial and the appropriate stage at which they should be produced. The court has the discretion to reject an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. if it deems the document or thing sought to be irrelevant or unnecessary at that stage. The relevance of the document or thing sought should be determined by the court at the time of the application and not at a later stage. The power under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. should not be used as a tool for fishing or roving inquiry and the document or thing sought should have a direct nexus with the case and should be necessary for the just decision of the case.
