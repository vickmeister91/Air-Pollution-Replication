The court order in question pertains to a civil writ petition filed by M/s Shiv Stone Crusher Co. and others against the State of Haryana and another. The petition sought the issuance of a writ in the nature of certiorari for setting aside an order passed by respondent No.2, whereby the consents to operate granted to the petitioners till 31.03.2015 have been declined to be further renewed. 

The petitioners were engaged in the business of stone crushing and had been granted consents to operate by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) till 31.03.2015. However, when they applied for the renewal of the consents, they were informed that the same had been declined. The petitioners contended that the order was arbitrary and without any basis, and sought its quashing.

During the course of the hearing, the court was informed that a notification had been issued by the Environment Department, State of Haryana, laying down the siting criteria as per Schedule I for stone crushing units. The notification had been issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and was aimed at regulating the location of stone crushing units and other industrial activities in the state.

The court noted that the notification had been issued subsequent to the passing of the impugned order, and that it had the effect of rendering the petition infructuous. In view of the same, the court disposed of the petition accordingly.

The court's decision is significant in that it underscores the importance of environmental regulations in the context of industrial activities. Stone crushing units, like other industrial activities, have the potential to cause significant harm to the environment and public health if not regulated properly. The notification issued by the Environment Department, State of Haryana, is aimed at addressing this concern by laying down clear siting criteria for stone crushing units and other industrial activities.

The court's decision also highlights the need for businesses to comply with environmental regulations and obtain the necessary consents and approvals before commencing operations. Failure to do so can result in legal action and the closure of the business, as was the case with the petitioners in this instance.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental regulations in promoting sustainable development and protecting the environment and public health. It also underscores the need for businesses to comply with these regulations and obtain the necessary consents and approvals before commencing operations.
