The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving cooperative societies in the state of Karnataka, India. In the first case, Sri Sanjay B Patil filed a petition against the State of Karnataka and various cooperative societies seeking to quash an order passed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies removing the managing committee of the Bijapur District Central Cooperative Bank and appointing an administrator to manage its affairs. The petitioners, who were members of the managing committee, argued that the bank had been performing well under their leadership and that the order was politically motivated. The court heard the case and reserved its order.

In the second case, the Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies issued a show cause notice to the managing committee of a bank under Section 30(1) of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act. The committee requested more time to respond and also sought certified copies of complaints and reports referred to in the notice. The committee was superseded by the Registrar, and the petitioners challenged the decision, arguing that they were not given a reasonable opportunity to respond. They also claimed that the previous committee's good performance did not absolve them of their own violations of the Act, rules, and guidelines. The court heard arguments from both sides.

The third court order discusses a case where the JRCS passed an order to supersede the managing committee of a cooperative society. The petitioners argued that they were not given an opportunity to submit their reply and that the order was vitiated for non-consultation with the financing bank. The court examined the availability of alternative remedies for challenging the order and discussed the possibility of official bias. The court concluded that nothing should be done to create doubt or suspicion in the mind of a party that there has been an improper interference in the cause of justice.

The fourth court order states that no action should be taken that creates doubt or suspicion of improper interference in the cause of justice. The judge who issued the show cause notice and rejected the defendant's defense should not hear the appeal as it may create bias. The rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is discretionary, and the court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction in appropriate cases. The court quashed the order of the Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies and granted the petitioners time to file additional objections to the show cause notice. The Deputy Commissioner or any other authority administering the Cooperative Bank Limited was directed to hand over the management to the administrator appointed by the court. The petitioners were restrained from taking any policy decisions until further orders.

In all of these cases, the court was tasked with determining whether the actions taken by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies were justified and whether the petitioners were given a fair opportunity to respond. The court also considered the possibility of bias and improper interference in the cause of justice. Ultimately, the court quashed the orders of the Registrar and granted the petitioners time to file additional objections. The court also appointed an administrator to manage the affairs of the cooperative societies in question.
