The case in question involves a breach of hazardous waste handling rules. The accused was charged with violating these rules and was subsequently acquitted by the trial court. The prosecution filed an appeal against this acquittal, which was heard by the appellate court.

The court begins by explaining the principles governing the hearing of appeals against orders of acquittal. It notes that the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. The court emphasizes that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law and that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution.
