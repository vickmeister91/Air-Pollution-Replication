The Bombay High Court heard multiple appeals related to construction and development within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) in Mumbai. The first case involved a suit filed by M/s. Vardhman & Hiranandani Developers against the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay to prevent the demolition of a building on a plot of land. The developers claimed that the property was not affected by CRZ regulations, and the Trial Court framed several issues, including whether the suit was within limitation and maintainable. The High Court found in favor of the developers, stating that the suit property was within the CRZ.

In another case, the court considered a building constructed within the CRZ without proper authorization. The plaintiffs argued that they followed due process and obtained approval for their building plans, while the defendants argued that the construction was unauthorized. The court found that the building was constructed within the CRZ and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to completion and occupation certificates. The plaintiffs appealed this decision, while the defendants appealed the part of the judgment that restrains them from demolishing the building. The court considered various documents and circulars related to the case and ultimately issued a final order.

The court also outlined a policy for regularizing construction work that has been carried out without proper approval. The policy includes different penalty charges depending on the nature of the offense, with charges ranging from 5% to 15% of the land cost. The Municipal Commissioner approved this policy, and the court mentioned a notification from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Union of India, which declares coastal stretches as CRZ and imposes restrictions on construction within 100 meters of the High Tide Line (HTL) or the width of the creek, river, or backwater, whichever is less. The plaintiffs in the case had requested regularization of their construction work, but the defendants refused to grant completion certificates due to the CRZ regulations. The plaintiffs filed a suit for a declaration that their construction was legal and not affected by the CRZ regulations.

The court also outlined regulations for activities within the CRZ, including prohibiting the discharge of untreated waste and effluents, dumping of waste for land filling, and mining of sand and rocks. The order also requires the preparation of Coastal Zone Management Plans by coastal states and Union Territory Administrations and outlines procedures for monitoring and enforcement of the regulations. The court found that the construction of building no.4 on the suit plot of land does not violate the regulations outlined in the notification dated 19.2.1991.

In another case, the plaintiffs argued that the construction of building no.4 does not violate CRZ II area as they had submitted a layout for issuance of sanction and IOD before the notification was issued. The plaintiffs also argued that the Corporation had granted permission for the construction of building no.4 and that the IOD was not handed over to them due to non-payment of requisite charges. The court also referred to a previous case where it was held that if the process of development starts prior to CRZ notification, then there is no question of affecting the project by the notification.

The court also considered the construction of a Bulk Receiving Station on Plot 148, which started before the CRZ Notification of 1991 came into force. The construction involves various stages, including laying of underground cables, and the building is required to be put up as underground cables at huge costs have already been laid down. The court considered the larger public interest and permitted the construction to continue. The order also cites previous judgments that state that all development and activities within CRZ will be valid and will not violate the provisions of the 1991 notification till the management plans are approved.

The court set aside two clauses and referred to a previous case regarding the Coastal Zone Management Plan and the identification and classification of CRZ areas. The court considered whether the Uppanar river and its banks fell within the CRZ III area and whether the transfer of hazardous substances beyond the port area to the PVC plant through pipelines was restricted by the 1991 Notification. The court referred to various paragraphs of the authority and the 1991 Notification to make its decision.

The court also ordered that any construction or expansion of jetties and wharves in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep must be based on a scientific study conducted by the Central Government or an authorized agency to suggest environmental safeguard measures for minimizing damage to corals and associated biodiversity. Coastal States and Union Territory Administrations must prepare Coastal Zone Management Plans within a year, identifying and classifying the CRZ areas within their respective territories in accordance with the guidelines given in Annexures-I and II of the Notification and obtain approval from the Central Government. The court also discussed the demarcation of HTL and the regulation of development along rivers, creeks, and backwaters.

The court also discussed the provisions of the 1966 Act related to the grant or refusal of permission for development on any land. It states that an application must be made to the Planning Authority, and if the authority does not communicate its decision within 60 days, permission is deemed to have been granted subject to certain conditions. The order also outlines penalties for unauthorized development or use of land, including imprisonment and fines. The Planning Authority is empowered to require the removal of unauthorized development and can take steps to stop or discontinue such development.

The court emphasized that no authority can encourage violation of the sanctioned plan and the courts should refrain from regularizing illegal and unauthorized constructions. The court
