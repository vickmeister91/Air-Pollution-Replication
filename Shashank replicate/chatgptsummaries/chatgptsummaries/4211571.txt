A recent court order has been issued in relation to a dispute over the custody of animals that were seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. The respondent in the case argued that the animals were exotic and had been smuggled into the country without permission. The court recalled an interim order that had been passed earlier and directed several parties to take custody of the animals and hand them over to a proper place or rescue center.

Specifically, the court ordered the Dy. Conservator of Forest, Tiger Strike Force, Indore, the District Forest Officer, Indore, and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence to take custody of the animals and ensure that they are placed in a safe and appropriate location. The petitioner in the case was given a week's time to file an additional reply, and the case was listed for hearing on 04/09/2019.

The dispute over the custody of these animals highlights the ongoing issue of animal smuggling and trafficking in India. Exotic animals are often smuggled into the country illegally and sold on the black market, leading to a range of negative consequences for both the animals and the environment.

In this case, it is unclear what type of animals were seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, but it is likely that they were rare or endangered species that had been smuggled into the country for profit. The fact that the court has ordered their custody to be transferred to a proper place or rescue center suggests that the animals may have been mistreated or neglected while in the possession of the respondent.

The court's decision to recall the interim order and issue a new directive for the custody of the animals is an important step in protecting the welfare of these creatures. By placing them in the care of trained professionals, the animals will have a better chance of survival and recovery.

However, it is important to note that this court order is just one small step in the fight against animal smuggling and trafficking. Much more needs to be done to address this issue, including increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations, as well as greater public awareness and education.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for animal welfare in India. It sends a clear message that the illegal trade in exotic animals will not be tolerated, and that those who engage in such activities will be held accountable for their actions. With continued efforts and cooperation from all stakeholders, we can work towards a future where all animals are treated with the respect and care they deserve.
