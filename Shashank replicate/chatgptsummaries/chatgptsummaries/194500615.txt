The Calcutta High Court recently dismissed a petition seeking direction to revoke permission letters granted to two respondents for running a mobile tower by diesel generator. The petitioners had approached the court seeking relief under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, alleging that the respondents were causing air pollution by running the mobile tower on diesel generator. 

The court observed that the petitioners had not exhausted the statutory remedy available to them under Section 31 of the Act, which provides for an appeal against the grant of permission. The court further noted that the petitioners had not made any representation to the authorities before approaching the court. 

The court also observed that the respondents had obtained the necessary permission from the authorities and were complying with the conditions imposed by the authorities. The court held that the petitioners had failed to make out a case for interference by the court and dismissed the petition. 

The court advised the petitioners to take recourse to the statutory appeal under Section 31 of the Act, which provides for an appeal against the grant of permission. The court also granted permission to the petitioners to withdraw the petition. 

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is an important legislation aimed at preventing and controlling air pollution. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and for the establishment of Boards at the Central and State levels for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. 

Under the Act, no person can establish or operate any industrial plant without obtaining the necessary consent from the State Pollution Control Board. The Act also provides for the regulation of emissions from automobiles, and for the control of emissions from other sources such as generators, boilers, and incinerators. 

The Act provides for the imposition of penalties for contravention of its provisions, and for the closure of industrial plants that violate the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides for the establishment of special courts for the trial of offences under the Act. 

The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, with the latest amendment being in 2018. The amendments have been aimed at strengthening the provisions of the Act and making it more effective in controlling air pollution. 

In conclusion, the Calcutta High Court's decision to dismiss the petition seeking direction to revoke permission letters granted to two respondents for running a mobile tower by diesel generator is in line with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Act provides for a statutory remedy in the form of an appeal against the grant of permission, which the petitioners had not exhausted. The court's decision highlights the importance of following the due process of law and exhausting the available remedies before approaching the court.
