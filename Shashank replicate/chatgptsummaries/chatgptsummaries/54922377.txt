The Rajasthan High Court recently issued an order regarding a stone crusher operated by Sidhi Vinayak Stone Crusher. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of the crusher, and the court was informed that the dismantling of the machinery had begun. The court directed the Board to initiate proceedings against the crusher under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 within six weeks. The petition was rendered infructuous.

The case involved a stone crusher operated by Sidhi Vinayak Stone Crusher in the Barwala village of Rajasthan. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of the crusher on the grounds that it was causing pollution in the area. The crusher had been operating without the necessary permissions and had been found to be violating the pollution control norms.

The petitioner, Sidhi Vinayak Stone Crusher, had challenged the order of the Pollution Control Board in the Rajasthan High Court. The petitioner had argued that the crusher was not causing any pollution and that the closure order was arbitrary and unjustified. The petitioner had also claimed that the crusher had all the necessary permissions and was operating in compliance with the pollution control norms.

The Rajasthan High Court had heard the arguments of both the parties and had reserved its judgment. The court had finally issued an order directing the Pollution Control Board to initiate proceedings against the crusher under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 within six weeks. The court had also observed that the petition had become infructuous as the dismantling of the machinery had already begun.

Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 provides for the penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act. The section states that any person who contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or any order or direction issued thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with a fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000 or with both. The section also provides for a further fine of Rs. 5,000 for every day during which the contravention continues after conviction for the first such contravention.

The order of the Rajasthan High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of compliance with the pollution control norms. The court has directed the Pollution Control Board to take strict action against the crusher for violating the pollution control norms. The court has also observed that the petition has become infructuous as the dismantling of the machinery had already begun.
