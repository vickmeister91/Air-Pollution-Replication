The court order in question pertains to two revision petitions filed by a man named Sansar against his conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court dismissed both petitions, stating that the appellate court had complied with all the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and that no prejudice had been caused to the petitioner.

The court also upheld the lower court's findings that Sansar was in conscious possession, custody, and control of animal trophies and uncured trophies covered under Section 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. This section prohibits the possession of any animal trophy or uncured trophy without a license or permit.

The court rejected all other points raised by the petitioner's counsel and dismissed both revision petitions. It is important to note that this is not the first time Sansar has been convicted under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. In fact, he has a history of wildlife-related offenses.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 with the aim of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves. It also prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

Section 49 of the act deals specifically with the possession of animal trophies and uncured trophies. It states that no person shall possess any animal trophy or uncured trophy without a license or permit. The section also provides for the forfeiture of any animal trophy or uncured trophy found in the possession of a person without a license or permit.

In Sansar's case, the court found that he was in possession of animal trophies and uncured trophies without a license or permit. The court also found that he was in conscious possession, custody, and control of these trophies. This means that he knew that he was in possession of these trophies and had control over them.

The court's decision to uphold Sansar's conviction and sentence sends a strong message about the importance of wildlife conservation. It also highlights the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations.

Wildlife trafficking is a multi-billion dollar industry that poses a serious threat to the survival of many species. It is estimated that thousands of animals are killed or captured every year for their skins, bones, and other body parts. This illegal trade not only threatens the survival of wildlife but also undermines the rule of law and fuels corruption.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act is an important tool in the fight against wildlife trafficking. It provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats and imposes strict penalties on those who violate its provisions. However, the effectiveness of the act depends on its enforcement.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness about the need to protect wildlife and their habitats. Governments, NGOs, and individuals have taken steps to raise awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation and to combat wildlife trafficking.

However, much more needs to be done to protect wildlife and their habitats. This includes strengthening wildlife laws and regulations, increasing enforcement efforts, and promoting sustainable development practices that take into account the needs of both people and wildlife.

In conclusion, the court's decision to uphold Sansar's conviction and sentence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act is a positive step towards protecting wildlife and their habitats. It sends a strong message about the importance of wildlife conservation and the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations. However, much more needs to be done to combat wildlife trafficking and promote sustainable development practices that take into account the needs of both people and wildlife.
