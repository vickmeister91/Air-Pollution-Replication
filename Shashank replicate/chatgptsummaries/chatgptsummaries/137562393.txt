The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various aspects of wildlife protection and mining activities near sanctuaries. The first order relates to a review of a previous order passed in a case related to mining activities near Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary. The petitioners of the writ petition have filed three applications for review of the common order passed by the bench in Civil Applications No. 6181 of 2013, 6184 of 2013 and 6189 of 2013. The court clarified its earlier order that no restraint order should be passed upon a quarry lease holder unless the activity falls within 1 km. area of the sanctuary. The petitioners argue that the Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary is notified under section 18 of the Act and therefore, there was no necessity of issuing any clarification. The court refers to sections 18 to 26A of the amended provisions of the Act to resolve the issue.

The second court order pertains to the protection of sanctuaries and the process of acquiring land or rights within the limits of a sanctuary. It outlines the appointment of a Collector to determine the existence, nature, and extent of rights of any person in or over the land comprised within the limits of the sanctuary. The Collector has the power to enter and survey the land and make a map of the same. The order also specifies the time limit for completing the acquisition proceedings and the delegation of the Collector's powers to other officers. Finally, it outlines the process for declaring an area as a sanctuary.

The third court order discusses the power of the State Government to declare an area as a sanctuary for the purpose of protecting wildlife and its environment. The order clarifies that the Government Resolution applicable to the Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary is not justiciable as the sanctuary has not been declared under the amended provisions of section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court also notes that an interim order passed by the Supreme Court in a pending matter cannot be considered a precedent or law laid down by the court. The order further discusses the importance of neutralizing any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court.

The fourth court order declares that the decision made by the Supreme Court in the case of GOA FOUNDATION is a precedent and should be enforced. The order prohibits mining activities within one kilometer of the boundaries of National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in the State of Goa. The court also directs the State Government to initiate action against mining lessees who violate rules and strictly enforce the Goa (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation of Minerals) Rules, 2013. The court's observations are tentative for the purpose of disposal of the interim order and will not be binding upon the parties at the time of final disposal of the public interest litigation.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and its environment by regulating mining activities near sanctuaries and declaring areas as sanctuaries. The orders also emphasize the need for fair and just proceedings in acquiring land or rights within the limits of a sanctuary and neutralizing any undeserved advantage gained by parties invoking the jurisdiction of the court. The orders provide guidance to the State Government and other authorities in enforcing rules and regulations related to wildlife protection and mining activities.
