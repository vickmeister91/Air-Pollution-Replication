The court order in question pertains to a case where M.P. Lime Works challenged the order passed by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forests, refusing to give a no objection certificate for the renewal of Dolomite and Soap Stone Mining lease. The permission was refused as the area was situated near Bheraghat, a tourist spot of national importance and an important water course in Jabalpur.

M.P. Lime Works had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, challenging the order of the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The company argued that the refusal to grant the no objection certificate was arbitrary and without any basis. The company also contended that the mining operations were being carried out in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh heard the arguments of both parties and dismissed the writ petition filed by M.P. Lime Works. The court held that the Ministry of Environment & Forests had acted in accordance with the law and had valid reasons for refusing to grant the no objection certificate. The court also observed that the area near Bheraghat was of national importance and any mining activity in the vicinity could have an adverse impact on the ecology of the area.

However, the court did not stop at dismissing the writ petition. The court also directed the respondents to submit a report on how many mining operations are taking place in or around Bheraghat and the exact distance from the water course and effect on ecology within eight weeks from the date of the order. This direction was given to ensure that the court had all the relevant information before making any further decisions in the matter.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting areas of national importance and the environment. The court's direction to the respondents to submit a report on the mining operations in the area is also important as it will provide the court with the necessary information to make an informed decision in the matter.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of M.P. Lime Works v. Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forests is an important decision that highlights the need to protect areas of national importance and the environment. The court's direction to the respondents to submit a report on the mining operations in the area is also significant as it will provide the court with the necessary information to make an informed decision in the matter.
