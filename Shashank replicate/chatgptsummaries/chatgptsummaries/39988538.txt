During the trial, the respondent moved an application under Section 311 of the CrPC to summon bank records of the petitioner. The trial court allowed the application, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order. The court modified the order to allow the respondent to summon the bank records during cross-examination of the petitioner but not to examine any witness until the evidence of the petitioner is concluded.

The case at hand involves a dispute between a husband and wife, with the wife alleging that she was subjected to torture by her husband and his relatives and was turned out of the matrimonial house. The trial court had granted interim maintenance to the petitioner, which was challenged by the respondent in a revision petition. The respondent had moved an application under Section 311 of the CrPC to summon bank records of the petitioner, which was allowed by the trial court. The petitioner filed a revision petition against the order, which was modified by the court to allow the respondent to summon the bank records during cross-examination of the petitioner but not to examine any witness until the evidence of the petitioner is concluded.

The court's decision to modify the order is significant as it strikes a balance between the rights of the petitioner and the respondent. While the respondent has the right to summon evidence to support his case, the court has ensured that the petitioner's rights are not violated in the process. By allowing the respondent to summon the bank records during cross-examination of the petitioner, the court has ensured that the respondent has access to the evidence he needs to support his case. At the same time, by not allowing the respondent to examine any witness until the evidence of the petitioner is concluded, the court has ensured that the petitioner's rights are protected and that she is not subjected to undue harassment.

The court's decision is also significant as it highlights the importance of Section 311 of the CrPC, which allows the court to summon any person as a witness or to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the just decision of the case. This section is an important tool for the court to ensure that justice is done in a case, and the court's decision in this case shows that it is willing to use this tool to ensure that the rights of both parties are protected.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is significant as it strikes a balance between the rights of the petitioner and the respondent. By allowing the respondent to summon the bank records during cross-examination of the petitioner but not to examine any witness until the evidence of the petitioner is concluded, the court has ensured that both parties have access to the evidence they need to support their case while also protecting the rights of the petitioner. The court's decision also highlights the importance of Section 311 of the CrPC in ensuring that justice is done in a case.
