The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by an industrial unit that manufactures CPC Blue (Alpha), a chemical product with potential for pollution. The unit had requested a refund of Rs. 1 lakh deposited with the court registry in 1997 for an external audit by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) as part of the Environmental Audit Scheme. The court ruled that the unit misread the scheme and that NEERI had already submitted a detailed report on the unit's environmental audit to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court ordered the registry to pay NEERI the audit fees and dismissed the application.

The case involved a dispute over the interpretation of the Environmental Audit Scheme, which was introduced by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to encourage industries to conduct environmental audits and take measures to reduce pollution. Under the scheme, industries were required to deposit a fee with the court registry for an external audit by NEERI, which would then submit a report to the pollution control board. The scheme was intended to promote environmental compliance and reduce pollution by providing an independent assessment of the environmental impact of industrial activities.

In this case, the industrial unit had deposited Rs. 1 lakh with the court registry in 1997 for an external audit by NEERI. However, the unit later requested a refund of the fee, claiming that it had already conducted an environmental audit and that NEERI's services were not required. The unit argued that the scheme did not require mandatory external audits and that it had fulfilled its obligations under the scheme by submitting a self-audit report to the pollution control board.

The court rejected the unit's arguments and held that the scheme required mandatory external audits by NEERI. The court noted that the scheme was introduced to provide an independent assessment of the environmental impact of industrial activities and that self-audit reports were not sufficient to meet the scheme's objectives. The court also observed that NEERI had already submitted a detailed report on the unit's environmental audit to the pollution control board, which indicated that the unit had not complied with the environmental standards prescribed by the board.

The court further held that the unit had misread the scheme and that it was not entitled to a refund of the fee deposited with the court registry. The court ordered the registry to pay NEERI the audit fees and dismissed the unit's application. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of environmental audits in promoting environmental compliance and reducing pollution. The decision also highlights the need for industries to carefully read and understand the requirements of environmental regulations and schemes to avoid disputes and legal challenges.
