The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the issue of jurisdiction in legal disputes. In the first case, the defendant made a counter-claim for recovery of possession of an immovable property in a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell. However, the court dismissed the counter-claim on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction since the property was situated outside the jurisdiction of the court. The appellant argued that there is no restriction regarding territorial jurisdiction of the court under Order 8 Rule 6-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows for a counter-claim to be made. The appellant relied on a previous decision of the Bombay High Court in support of their argument. However, the court upheld the dismissal of the counter-claim.

In the second case, the issue of territorial jurisdiction was also discussed in relation to a counter-claim filed by the defendant in a suit for possession of a property. The defendant argued that the court has jurisdiction to decide the counter-claim, which is in the nature of damages, as long as it does not exceed the pecuniary limits of the court's jurisdiction. The plaintiff argued that the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the counter-claim as the property is situated outside the territorial limits of the court. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the defendant, stating that the only restriction on the counter-claim is the pecuniary limit and that the court can decide the counter-claim even if it relates to matters beyond its territorial jurisdiction.

The third court order discussed the jurisdiction of the High Court to try and determine suits of every description, as guided by Clause 12 of the Letters Patent. The order explains the different categories of jurisdiction, including total and absolute jurisdiction, inchoate jurisdiction, and the circumstances under which a suit under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent would lie. The order also discusses the concept of jurisdiction, including territorial, pecuniary, and subject matter jurisdiction, and how it is imposed by the statute, charter, or commission under which the court is constituted.

The fourth court order discussed the concept of jurisdiction and its limitations. It states that a court must have jurisdiction over a particular matter before it can make a decision on it. Jurisdiction can be limited by the type of claims and matters the court can handle, or by the geographical area it covers. If a court exercises jurisdiction it does not possess, its decision is invalid. The order also distinguishes between void and voidable acts, and notes that not all incorrect or illegal decrees are necessarily void. In the case at hand, the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the counter-claim, which was situated outside its jurisdiction.

In the fifth and final court order, the jurisdiction of a court to hear and decide legal controversies was discussed. It specifically addressed the issue of counterclaims and whether a court has jurisdiction over them if they pertain to a property outside the court's jurisdiction. The court concluded that a counterclaim can only be entertained if the court has both territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction over the matter. In this case, the court lacked jurisdiction over the counterclaim, as it pertained to a property outside its jurisdiction. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of jurisdiction in legal disputes and the limitations that courts face in deciding cases that fall outside their jurisdictional boundaries. It is crucial for parties to understand the jurisdictional requirements before filing a case or making a counter-claim to avoid wasting time and resources on a case that may ultimately be dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction.
