The court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Ramesh Chand against an order passed by the court of Sh. Bhupinder Singh, Ld. MM in CC No. 356/2013. The revisionist had filed an application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. which was dismissed by the Ld. MM. The revisionist had raised various grounds in the revision petition, including that the complaint discloses cognizable offence and the police should have registered an FIR. 

The court observed that the power to direct police to register a case and initiate investigations has to be exercised judiciously on proper grounds and not in a mechanical manner. The court found no illegality or irregularity in the order of the Ld. Trial Court and dismissed the revision petition.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the registration of an FIR. The revisionist had filed an application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. seeking the registration of an FIR against the respondent. The Ld. MM had dismissed the application, prompting the revisionist to file a revision petition.

In the revision petition, the revisionist had raised various grounds, including that the complaint discloses cognizable offence and the police should have registered an FIR. The revisionist had argued that the respondent had committed an offence under Section 420 IPC and that the police should have registered an FIR on the basis of the complaint.

The court, however, observed that the power to direct police to register a case and initiate investigations has to be exercised judiciously on proper grounds and not in a mechanical manner. The court noted that the revisionist had not provided any material to show that the police had refused to register an FIR or that there was any illegality or irregularity in the order of the Ld. MM.

The court further observed that the mere fact that the revisionist had made allegations against the respondent did not automatically entitle him to the registration of an FIR. The court noted that the police had the discretion to decide whether or not to register an FIR based on the facts and circumstances of the case.

The court also noted that the revisionist had not provided any material to show that the respondent had committed an offence under Section 420 IPC. The court observed that the allegations made by the revisionist were vague and lacked specificity.

In light of these observations, the court found no illegality or irregularity in the order of the Ld. Trial Court and dismissed the revision petition. The court emphasized that the power to direct police to register a case and initiate investigations should be exercised judiciously and not in a mechanical manner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a revision filed by Ramesh Chand against an order passed by the court of Sh. Bhupinder Singh, Ld. MM in CC No. 356/2013. The court found no illegality or irregularity in the order of the Ld. Trial Court and dismissed the revision petition. The court emphasized that the power to direct police to register a case and initiate investigations should be exercised judiciously and not in a mechanical manner.
