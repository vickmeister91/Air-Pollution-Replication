The Jharkhand High Court recently rejected the plea for anticipatory bail of five individuals who were apprehending their arrests in connection with a case involving alleged offenses under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, Sections 4/21 of the Pollution Control Act, and Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioners were accused of illegally stacking stone boulders and running stone crushers without obtaining the NOC from the Pollution Control Board.

The case was filed against the petitioners by the State of Jharkhand, which alleged that the petitioners had been illegally operating stone crushers and stacking stone boulders in violation of the Pollution Control Act and the Indian Forest Act. The State also alleged that the petitioners had been involved in the theft of stone boulders from the forest area.

The petitioners had filed a plea for anticipatory bail, which was rejected by the Jharkhand High Court. The Court observed that the allegations against the petitioners were serious in nature and that the investigation was still ongoing. The Court also noted that the petitioners had not obtained the necessary NOC from the Pollution Control Board, which was a clear violation of the law.

The Court further observed that the petitioners had not cooperated with the investigation and had failed to produce the necessary documents and evidence. The Court also noted that the petitioners had a history of similar offenses and that they were likely to abscond if granted anticipatory bail.

The Court, therefore, rejected the plea for anticipatory bail and directed the petitioners to surrender before the investigating authorities. The Court also directed the investigating authorities to complete the investigation within a period of three months.

This decision by the Jharkhand High Court highlights the importance of complying with the law and obtaining the necessary permissions and licenses before undertaking any activity. It also emphasizes the need for cooperation with the investigating authorities and the production of necessary documents and evidence.

The decision also serves as a warning to those who engage in illegal activities and violate environmental laws. The Court's decision sends a strong message that such activities will not be tolerated and that those who engage in them will be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to reject the plea for anticipatory bail of the five individuals accused of illegally stacking stone boulders and running stone crushers without obtaining the NOC from the Pollution Control Board is a significant step towards ensuring compliance with environmental laws and holding those who violate them accountable for their actions.
