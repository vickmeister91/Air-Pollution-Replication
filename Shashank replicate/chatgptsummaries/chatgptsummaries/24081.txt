The Indian judiciary has been known to be a strong proponent of natural justice and fairness in its decisions. In a recent case, the court was faced with the dilemma of whether to strike down an order of the government passed in breach of the principles of natural justice or to refuse relief on the ground that it would lead to the restoration of another illegal order. The case related to the lease of a property belonging to a Hindu Religious and Charitable Institution. The government had taken a decision to accept the offer of one person for the lease of the land without conducting a public auction, which was in contravention of the rules.

The petitioner in the case had challenged the government's decision to lease the property to a particular individual without conducting a public auction. The petitioner had argued that the government's decision was in violation of the principles of natural justice and that it had caused him financial loss. The petitioner had also claimed that he had a legitimate expectation that the property would be leased to him as he had made an offer for the same.

The court, in its judgment, held that both the orders of the government were not legally passed and refused to exercise its discretion to strike down the order cancelling the earlier order. The court also rejected the petitioner's claim of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation. The court held that the government's decision to lease the property to a particular individual without conducting a public auction was in contravention of the rules and was therefore illegal. The court also held that the petitioner's claim of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation was not valid as the government had not made any promise to the petitioner that the property would be leased to him.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it highlights the importance of natural justice and fairness in the decision-making process of the government. The court's decision also reinforces the principle that the government must act in accordance with the law and cannot act arbitrarily or in violation of the rules. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to the government that it must conduct itself in a transparent and accountable manner and must ensure that its decisions are fair and just.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the Indian legal system. The court's decision reinforces the importance of natural justice and fairness in the decision-making process of the government and serves as a reminder to the government that it must act in accordance with the law and cannot act arbitrarily or in violation of the rules. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to the government that it must conduct itself in a transparent and accountable manner and must ensure that its decisions are fair and just.
