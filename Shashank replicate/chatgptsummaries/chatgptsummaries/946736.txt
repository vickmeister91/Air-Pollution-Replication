The Delhi High Court recently heard two cases related to the closure of industrial mills in the city. In the first case, a petition was filed challenging the decision of the Lt. Governor, Delhi, to refuse permission to close the Delhi Cloth Mills, which was located in a non-conforming area and was economically unviable. The petitioner argued that the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan required the mill to be permanently closed at the present site with effect from January 18, 1989. The court upheld the vires of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, which requires reasons to be recorded in writing for granting or refusing permission for closure. The court found that the Lt. Governor had not given good reasons for refusing permission and had not taken into account the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan. The court emphasized the obligation of the authority to apply its mind to pertinent matters only and not be influenced by irrelevant or extraneous matters. The interest of the labor has been safeguarded through a settlement.

In the second case, the court ordered the closure of a mill that had been discharging toxic effluents and causing pollution, despite the denial of consent by the Central Pollution Control Board. The court found that the continued discharge of toxic effluents was against the larger interest of the public and that the possibility of the mill becoming financially viable was uncertain. The court noted that the interest of the labor had been taken into account in the settlement between the petitioners and 12 unions of the workers. The court quashed the orders of the Lt. Governor and directed him to grant permission to close the mill within seven days. The parties will bear their own costs.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of considering the larger public interest and the obligation of the authority to apply its mind to pertinent matters only. The interest of the labor was also taken into account in both cases. The court upheld the vires of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, which requires reasons to be recorded in writing for granting or refusing permission for closure. The court found that the Lt. Governor had not given good reasons for refusing permission in the first case and that the continued discharge of toxic effluents was against the larger interest of the public in the second case.

The court's decision in the first case is significant as it upholds the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan and emphasizes the obligation of the authority to apply its mind to pertinent matters only. The court's decision in the second case is significant as it emphasizes the importance of considering the larger public interest and the obligation of the authority to apply its mind to pertinent matters only. The court's decision in both cases is significant as it takes into account the interest of the labor and upholds the vires of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Overall, the court's decisions in these cases highlight the importance of considering the larger public interest and the obligation of the authority to apply its mind to pertinent matters only. The interest of the labor was also taken into account in both cases. The court's decisions uphold the mandatory provisions of the Master Plan and the vires of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act.
