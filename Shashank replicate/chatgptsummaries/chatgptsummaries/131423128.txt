The court order in question pertains to a criminal case in Rajasthan, where the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to compel the complainant to produce documents regarding the transmission of money from abroad and the sale of land. The petitioner had sought these documents to impeach the financial capacity of the complainant, who was the main witness in the case.

However, the court ruled that a witness cannot be compelled to produce documents and that the case of the prosecution has to stand on its own legs. The court held that the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is not mandatory and that the court has to exercise its discretion in such matters. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents and that the complainant had already given his evidence in the case.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the complainant's evidence during the cross-examination and that he had not raised any objection to the admissibility of the evidence. The court held that the petitioner cannot be allowed to challenge the complainant's evidence at a later stage by seeking the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and allowed him to withdraw the petition with liberty to raise all arguments available to him before the trial court at an appropriate stage to impeach the financial capacity of the complainant.

The court's ruling is significant as it clarifies the scope and limitations of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the powers of the court to compel the production of documents. The court has held that the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is not mandatory and that the court has to exercise its discretion in such matters.
