The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the protection of the environment and wildlife in India, particularly in and around the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and the Gahiramatha (Marine) Wildlife Sanctuary. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and cites various constitutional provisions and international declarations.

In the first court order, the petitioner and intervenors alleged that various activities in and around the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary were adversely affecting the ecosystem, including the Olive Ridley sea turtle habitat. The opposite parties accused the petitioner of presenting "publicity interest litigation" in the guise of public interest litigation. The court highlighted the urgent need to address the issue of disappearing species and the importance of maintaining ecological balance. The court directed the state to constitute an Environment Impact Assessment Study Group to evaluate the situation and make recommendations.

The second court order discusses the importance of environmental law in protecting and improving the environment, and the challenges faced by legislatures in enacting and amending such laws. It also highlights the historical importance placed on environmental protection in India, particularly with regards to rivers and soil. The order notes the increasing global concern for environmental protection and the potential liabilities for non-compliance with environmental legislation. The specific case discussed involves the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary in India, which is home to a unique mangrove ecosystem and the largest rookery of Olive Ridley turtles in the world.

The third court order discusses a report on the impact of fishing boats and construction of fish landing centers on the ecology of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary. The report suggests certain protective measures to minimize adverse impacts. The State Government has accepted the suggestions and views expressed by the report and is willing to implement them without infringing statutory provisions of law and without affecting the eco-system of Bhitarkanika Sanctuary. The court also discusses the applicability of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and Fishing Regulation Act to the construction of jetties and bridges.

The fourth court order discusses the situation in the Gahiramatha (Marine) Wildlife Sanctuary and the need to balance developmental activities with environmental protection. The court suggests various measures to be taken, including curbing the influx of migratory human population, realigning the road to avoid adverse impact on the ecology of the sanctuary, evicting unauthorized occupants of forest land, and declaring forest lands within the sanctuary as reserve forest. The court also suggests involving local people in conservation efforts and promoting eco-tourism. The court emphasizes the need to protect marine fauna, particularly sea turtles, and suggests setting up a High Level Committee for protection, conservation, and research on sea turtles.

The fifth court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife, citing the World Charter for Nature and a decree from King Asoka. It also notes that natural resources must be used with care and long-term planning to avoid depletion, and that protection of the environment is a constitutional goal that requires action from both the government and citizens. The court directs the state and central governments to take necessary steps to implement these directions.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of environmental protection and the need for immediate, determined, and effective steps to protect the environment. The court suggests various measures to be taken, including involving local people in conservation efforts, promoting eco-tourism, and setting up committees for protection, conservation, and research on sea turtles.
