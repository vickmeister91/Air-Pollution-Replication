The court orders discussed in this article pertain to the construction and relocation of a bridge over the river Varuna in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The first court order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by Prem Chandra Srivastava against the State of U.P. and others. The petitioner alleged that the bridge was being constructed to serve the individual interests of respondent Nos. 3 to 5, to connect their agricultural fields on either side of the river, and that public funds were being used for the same. The court stayed the construction of the bridge and directed the respondents to file replies. The court also noted that there was no public road to connect the bridge on both sides and that the public money was being used to benefit only a few individuals. The court further observed that the constructions were being done at the behest of respondent Nos. 3 to 5, who had good connections in the government, and that there was no order passed by any competent authority for such diversion. The court directed the respondents not to proceed with the construction of the bridge until further notice.

The second court order discusses a counter affidavit regarding the construction of a bridge over the Varuna river. The inspection report states that the spot in question will severely affect the environment due to obstruction of water flow. The counter affidavit argues that the bridge is being constructed to improve drainage capacity and increase water flow. The bridge is being constructed at the side of old bridges and is not being built solely for the benefit of certain individuals. The State has filed an affidavit stating that the bridge is being constructed 1.5 km away from an existing bridge. The court order provides details about the location of the bridge and the land ownership of the area.

The third court order discusses the construction of a new bridge that will benefit villagers on both sides of the river and provide convenience for their movement. The order includes statements from officials denying any issues with water logging or floods and providing details about the approach road and land ownership. The order also questions the authorization and technical approval of the bridge's site change, which was made for the benefit of some farmers without a connecting road.

The fourth court order states that a proposed diversion of a bridge to benefit some farmers was unauthorized and did not have technical approval from competent authorities. The construction of the bridge was relocated without approval and authority, and public funds were diverted to benefit certain individuals. The court ordered the respondents to stop the construction of the bridge at the relocated site and proceed to construct the bridge at the approved site. The petitioner was awarded costs of Rs. 10,000 for pursuing the litigation in public interest. The Irrigation Department was directed to comply with Section 24 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 before carrying on any construction on the bridges.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article pertain to the construction and relocation of a bridge over the river Varuna in Uttar Pradesh, India. The orders highlight issues related to the use of public funds for the benefit of a few individuals, lack of technical approval and authorization for the construction and relocation of the bridge, and concerns about the impact of the construction on the environment. The court orders provide directions to the respondents to stop the construction of the bridge until further notice, comply with relevant laws and regulations, and proceed with the construction of the bridge at the approved site. The orders also award costs to the petitioner for pursuing the litigation in public interest.
