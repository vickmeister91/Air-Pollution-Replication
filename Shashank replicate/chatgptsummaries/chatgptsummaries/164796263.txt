The court orders in question pertain to two separate cases involving the treatment of birds under animal welfare laws in India. In the first case, a criminal revision petition was filed by Sangeeta Das against the release of 64 pigeons and 13 baby pigeons to respondent no. 2 by the Ld MM concerned in DD No.82-B dated 11.05.2012 U/s 78/99 of the Delhi Police Act. Das claimed to be a member of a voluntary organization named 'Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre' and argued that the release of the birds to respondent no. 2 was against the provisions of Section 29 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and Section 39 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court examined the legal provisions and found that the accused could have been prosecuted either under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act or under the Delhi Police Act, which is a special enactment operating in the state of Delhi. The punishment for the above offence prescribed U/s 11 of the P.C.A. Act is a fine only of not less than ten rupees but extending up to fifty rupees. The court ultimately dismissed the petition, finding that the release of the birds was not in violation of animal welfare laws.

In the second case, the accused was charged with keeping birds in a cage, which is a violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The court found that the birds fell under the definition of "animal" as per the act and upheld the fine imposed by the lower court. However, the court also directed the release of the birds to the accused as they were not wild animals and did not fall under the purview of the Wildlife Act. The court dismissed the revision petition and sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.

These two cases highlight the complex legal landscape surrounding animal welfare in India. While there are laws in place to protect animals from cruelty, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws can vary widely depending on the circumstances of each case. In the first case, the court found that the release of the birds was not in violation of animal welfare laws, while in the second case, the court upheld a fine for keeping birds in a cage but also allowed for their release to the accused.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of careful consideration and interpretation of animal welfare laws in India. As the country continues to grapple with issues related to animal cruelty and welfare, it will be important for courts and lawmakers to work together to ensure that these laws are applied consistently and effectively to protect animals from harm.
