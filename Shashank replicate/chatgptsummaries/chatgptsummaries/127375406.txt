The court order in question pertains to an appeal filed against a judgment in a writ petition. The petitioner was aggrieved by the grant of a contract in favor of one of the respondents. The respondent in question was Andrew Yule Co. Ltd. The petitioner challenged the respondent's status as not falling within the definition of 'State' as contained in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 

The writ petition was dismissed by the court, stating that the pleadings were insufficient to arrive at a decision on whether Andrew Yule is a 'State' or not. The Division Bench considered all necessary facts and materials placed before it and concluded that the respondent Andrew Yule Co. Ltd. does not fall within the ambit of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 

The court held that the writ petition was correctly dismissed by the learned single Judge and dismissed both the appeal and the application. This decision was based on the fact that Andrew Yule Co. Ltd. is not a 'State' as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 

The concept of 'State' as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution of India is an important one. It includes the government and Parliament of India, the government and Legislature of each of the States, all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. It also includes any other authority that the President may specify in this regard. 

The court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and materials presented before it. The court noted that Andrew Yule Co. Ltd. is a public sector undertaking that was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. The company is engaged in the business of manufacturing and trading in various products, including tea, engineering, electrical, and other products. 

The court also noted that the company is wholly owned by the Government of India and that the government has a controlling stake in the company. However, the court held that this alone is not sufficient to bring the company within the ambit of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 

The court further noted that the company is not performing any public function or discharging any public duty. The court held that the mere fact that the company is owned by the government and has a controlling stake in it does not make it a 'State' as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope and ambit of the definition of 'State' as contained in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The decision also highlights the importance of careful consideration of all relevant facts and materials before arriving at a decision in such cases. 

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an appeal filed against a judgment in a writ petition. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the pleadings were insufficient to arrive at a decision on whether Andrew Yule is a 'State' or not. The Division Bench considered all necessary facts and materials placed before it and concluded that the respondent Andrew Yule Co. Ltd. does not fall within the ambit of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The court held that the writ petition was correctly dismissed by the learned single Judge and dismissed both the appeal and the application.
