The court order pertains to four different civil writ petitions filed by various parties against the State of Kerala and various government officials. These petitions involve land disputes and violations of Cardamom Rules, 1935. The court heard the cases on different dates and delivered judgments on each case.

In the first case, M/S.Autumn Wood Resorts (Cloud 9) filed a petition seeking relief from the court regarding possession and non-attachment of land, building plans, approvals, and certifications. The petitioner submitted exhibits such as copies of orders, appeals, judgments, certificates, and receipts related to the resort's possession. The court heard the case on 11-12-2013 and delivered the final judgment on 25-07-2014.

In the second case, the petitioner sought relief from the court, including the quashing of an order to remand the matter to the District Collector, the dropping of proceedings against the petitioner, and compensation for the demolition of their property. The respondent denied the petitioner's claims and argued that the government has a right to the property in question. The court will need to review the evidence and arguments presented by both parties to make a decision.

In the third case, the petitioner's property was resumed by the District Collector due to the violation of Cardamom Rules, 1935. The petitioner challenged the order of resumption and sought compensation for the alleged illegal act of the respondents. The court held that the resumption of land can only be done by observing due process of law and the District Collector has no authority to exercise any power under Rule 28 of the Cardamom Rules, 1935. The court also stated that the contract between the parties governs the issue and the terms of the grant must be complied with. The court found the Land Revenue Commissioner's order to be bad in law and allowed the petitioner to challenge it.

In the fourth case, the court stated that the Cardamom Rules, 1935 govern the issue of land assignment and compliance with the rules is necessary. The authorities under the rules cannot take any action due to the repeal of the rules. The property involved may come under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 if it is covered by a notification stating that it is a reserved forest. Land Conservancy proceedings cannot be invoked if the land does not belong to the government. The petitioner is entitled to compensation for the demolition of their buildings, but the amount is not specified. The respondents are directed to restore possession of the property to the petitioner within a month. The petitioner cannot make any construction activity in the cardamom area without permission from the government until a final decision is taken in appropriate proceedings.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of compliance with rules and regulations related to land assignment and possession. The court has emphasized the need for due process of law and adherence to contractual terms in land disputes. The court has also directed the government to restore possession of the property to the petitioner and provide compensation for any illegal acts. These court orders serve as a reminder to all parties involved in land disputes to follow the legal procedures and regulations to avoid any legal consequences.
