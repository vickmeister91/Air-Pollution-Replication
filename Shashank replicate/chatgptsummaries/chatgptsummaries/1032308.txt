The court order pertains to a case where the Commissioner of Customs challenged the decision of the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, which allowed the appeal filed by C-Net Communication (I) Pvt. Ltd. The question at hand was whether Signal Decoders used by cable operators for distributing satellite signals collected by Dish Antenna are covered under Entry 8528 or 8529. The Tribunal held that the relevant applicable Entry is 8529, as the Decoder is more or less a part suitable for a specific purpose with the apparatus of 8528, i.e. the Reception apparatus for television. The court ultimately held that the Tribunal erred in allowing the appeal filed by the assessee and that the relevant Entry is 8528.

The court order discusses the classification of a decoder used in satellite television reception systems. The assessee argued that the correct tariff item was 8529.90.90, while the tribunal held that it fell under 8528.12.99 as it was an essential and integral component of the satellite television reception system. The court analyzed technical literature and user manuals to determine that the decoder was a reception apparatus for television and fell under the amended entry 8528. The court set aside the tribunal's order and restored that of the Commissioner of Appeals.
