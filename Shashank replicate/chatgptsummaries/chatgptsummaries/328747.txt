The court order pertains to two appeals filed by K. Narayana Reddy and Ramakrishna Reddy regarding a judgment and decree passed by the I Addl. City Civil Judge, Bangalore in OS 2400/1985. The plaintiff sought specific performance against the defendant in respect of a property they had entered into an agreement for sale in 1975. The defendant contested the suit, claiming that the plaintiff did not perform his part of the obligation and that the suit was barred by limitation. The court framed several issues and ultimately decreed the suit in part, directing the defendant to execute a sale deed for the property within three months. The defendant appealed the decision, arguing that the suit was barred by limitation and that time was the essence of the contract. The plaintiff argued that the defendant did not fulfill his obligations under the agreement and that the suit was not barred by limitation. The court considered several points of contention and ultimately upheld the Trial Court's decision.

The court order states that the plaintiff and defendant had entered into an agreement for the sale of a property, and the plaintiff had paid an advance amount. The remaining amount was to be paid within one month, and the defendant would execute the sale deed and secure possession certificate. However, the plaintiff failed to prove that he was in possession of the property, and subsequent payments made by him were not proven. The court found that the suit was barred by limitation and the contract was deemed to have been terminated. The defendant was not liable for the marginal land as he had no subsisting interest in it. The finding of the Trial Court on several issues was reversed.

The court order sets aside the finding of the Trial Court and upholds that the defendant had no right to the marginal land and that the suit is barred by limitation. The plaintiff's prayer for judgment and decree to convey the marginal land is rejected, and the suit of the plaintiff is dismissed. The defendant is ordered to return the earnest money with interest, and each party is to bear their own costs.
