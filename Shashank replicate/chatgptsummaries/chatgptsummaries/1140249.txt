In a recent court case, a writ petition was filed by Nilambar Sahu and Anr. to challenge the termination of their mining lease. The respondents argued that the land on which the mining lease was granted falls within the Palkot Wild Life Sanctuary and therefore, the lease was rightly cancelled. The court directed the Deputy Commissioner to produce necessary documents justifying the termination of lease. However, instead of an affidavit, a statement of fact was produced by the Divisional Forest Officer stating that the land is not a notified forest land. The court quashed the order of termination of lease and proceeded against the officers for filing a perfunctory affidavit.

However, a review petition was filed by the respondents stating that the land falls within the Wild Life Sanctuary and a notification was issued in 1990. The court held that carrying on mining activities on the land which falls within the forest area and declared as wild life sanctuary will be against the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the mandate issued by the Supreme Court. The order of termination of lease was found to be legal and justified, and the writ petition was dismissed.

The case highlights the importance of following the legal procedures and providing accurate information in court proceedings. The court found that the initial termination of the mining lease was not justified as the necessary documents were not produced. However, upon review, it was found that the land falls within a protected area and mining activities would be against the law. This decision is in line with the government's efforts to protect the environment and wildlife.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the mandate issued by the Supreme Court are all aimed at protecting the environment and wildlife. The court's decision to uphold these laws and cancel the mining lease is a step towards preserving the natural resources of the country. It is important for individuals and companies to follow these laws and regulations to ensure sustainable development and protect the environment.

The case also highlights the need for accurate and complete information to be provided in court proceedings. The court found that the initial affidavit provided by the Divisional Forest Officer was perfunctory and did not provide the necessary information. This led to the court quashing the order of termination of lease. It is important for individuals and government officials to provide accurate and complete information in court proceedings to ensure that justice is served.

In conclusion, the court's decision to cancel the mining lease on land within a protected area is a step towards preserving the environment and wildlife. The case highlights the importance of following legal procedures and providing accurate information in court proceedings. It is important for individuals and companies to follow the laws and regulations aimed at protecting the environment to ensure sustainable development.
