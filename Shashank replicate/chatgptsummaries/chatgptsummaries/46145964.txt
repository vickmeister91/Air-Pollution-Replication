The court order in question relates to a petition filed by K. Nagarajan, who sought to condone the delay of 122 days in filing a criminal revision against an order passed by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner claimed that he was suffering from jaundice and family problems, which prevented him from contacting his counsel and obtaining a copy of the order. However, the court found that the delay had not been satisfactorily explained and lacked bona fides, and therefore dismissed the petition.

The case highlights the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for a satisfactory explanation for any delay. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any medical certificate or other evidence to support his claim of suffering from jaundice. Similarly, there was no evidence to support his claim of family problems. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to contact his counsel or obtain a copy of the order during the period of delay.

The court emphasized that the right to file a revision petition is not an absolute right and must be exercised within the prescribed time limit. The court also noted that the delay in filing the petition had caused prejudice to the respondent, who had already obtained an order in his favor. The court therefore held that the delay had not been satisfactorily explained and lacked bona fides, and dismissed the petition.

The case also highlights the importance of providing evidence to support any claim of illness or other circumstances that may have prevented timely filing of a petition. In the absence of such evidence, the court may not be inclined to condone the delay.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder to litigants of the importance of timely filing of petitions and the need for a satisfactory explanation for any delay. It also emphasizes the need for evidence to support any claim of illness or other circumstances that may have prevented timely filing of a petition. Failure to provide such evidence may result in the court dismissing the petition.
