The case at hand involves a challenge to a judgment and order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge in Criminal Revision Application No.166 of 2012. The petitioner, Vishal Mhatre, was accused of offences punishable under Sections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The learned trial Magistrate discharged the petitioner/accused of these offences, but the revisional court set aside the order of discharge. The petitioner argued that he needs to be discharged from the offence alleged against him as the charge-sheet filed by the police is non-est. The prosecution alleged the offence punishable under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, against accused persons including the petitioner.

The court order clarifies that cognizance of offences under the Environment (Protection) Act can only be taken by the court on the basis of a complaint made by the Central Government or an authorized officer, or by a private person who has given notice of the alleged offence and their intention to make a complaint. The order notes that a police report cannot be considered a complaint, but a report of a non-cognizable offence submitted after investigation by the police can be considered a complaint. In the case at hand, proceedings were initiated against the accused based on a police report, rather than a complaint made by the authorities prescribed under Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act.

The court has determined that it does not have jurisdiction to take action against the petitioner for an offense under Section 15 of the Environment Act based on a document submitted by the police. Any action taken by the court in violation of this provision would be void and non-existent. The court also found that the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge was in error and needs to be set aside. The case was not commenced by the authorities mentioned in Section 19 of the Environment Act, but rather on the basis of a police report. The petition is allowed and the rule is made absolute in terms of Prayer Clause (a).
