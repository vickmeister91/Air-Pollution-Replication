The court order pertains to a dispute between a landlord and tenant over the payment of rent and interest. The tenant had paid the arrears of rent and electricity charges after a court order, but the landlord demanded interest on the arrears through a legal notice. The court found that the notice was invalid as the tenant had already been directed by the court to pay the arrears, and the landlord had no cause to issue the notice. The court also rejected the argument that the tenant was a defaulter, as he had paid the arrears before any notice was issued.

The court order states that a tenant cannot be considered a defaulter if they have paid their rent before receiving a notice of demand. The court cites a previous case to support this decision. The petitioner in this case had issued a notice for interest on delayed payment of rent, but the court found it to be invalid as the tenant had already paid the arrears. The court also notes that the tenant had regularly sent money orders for rent, which were returned refused by the petitioner. The court dismisses the petition as the petitioner failed to prove default in payment of legally recoverable rent.
