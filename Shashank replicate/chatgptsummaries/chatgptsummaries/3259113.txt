The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Jose D. Kalleli against the State of Kerala and others. The petitioner had filed an application for composition of an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, but the proceedings were not finalized. The petitioner then filed a writ petition, and the court directed the fourth respondent to finalize the proceedings within two months. The fourth respondent rejected the petitioner's prayer to compound the offence, and the petitioner challenged this order.

The court held that the order passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Nemmara, was not competent as per the Act and Rules. The court set aside the order and directed the Divisional Forest Officer (Deputy Conservator of Forest), Nemmara, to consider the petitioner's application afresh and pass appropriate orders after affording sufficient opportunity to the petitioner to advance his contentions. The proceedings initiated against the petitioner were stayed until then.
