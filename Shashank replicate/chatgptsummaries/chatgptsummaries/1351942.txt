The Madras High Court was recently asked to decide whether the conviction of Ganga Bai for offences under the Tamil Nadu Scheduled Commodities (Regulation of Distribution by Card System) Order, 1982, read with section 7(1)(a)(ii) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, could be sustained as the offence was committed by the co-operative society and not by the individual. The court examined two Supreme Court judgments, Sheoratan Agarwal v. State of Madhya Pradesh and U.P. Pollution Control Board v. Messrs. Modi Distillery and others, but found them irrelevant to the present case. The court held that the non-prosecution of the authorised dealer was not fatal to the prosecution against the appellant who was merely a servant.

The court order discusses the case of Sheoratan Agarwal and clarifies that if a company commits an offense, every person who would be liable at the time of the offense can also be proceeded against. However, the burden of proof is on the delinquent officer or servant of the company to prove that they did not know of the offense or connived in it or that they had exercised all due diligence to prevent it. The court also emphasizes that if an offense is committed with the consent or connivance of any director, manager, secretary, or other officer of the company, they will also be deemed guilty and liable to be punished accordingly.

The court further clarifies that the company should be joined as a party-accused if there is an allegation against the company for having committed the contravention and where vicariously criminal liability is being alleged against the officers. This means that if a company is accused of committing an offence, the officers of the company can also be held liable for the offence. The court also discusses the non-prosecution of the authorized dealer and clarifies that the accused cannot claim any benefit on account of the non-prosecution of the authorized agent.

Ultimately, the court returns the reference and directs the matter to be kept before the learned single judge for being disposed of. This means that the case will be sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.

In summary, the Madras High Court has clarified that if a company commits an offence, the officers of the company can also be held liable for the offence. The burden of proof is on the delinquent officer or servant of the company to prove that they did not know of the offence or connived in it or that they had exercised all due diligence to prevent it. The court also clarifies that the company should be joined as a party-accused if there is an allegation against the company for having committed the contravention and where vicariously criminal liability is being alleged against the officers. The court further clarifies that the accused cannot claim any benefit on account of the non-prosecution of the authorized agent. Ultimately, the case will be sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.
