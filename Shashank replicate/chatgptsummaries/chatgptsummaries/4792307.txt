The fourth court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area.

The fifth court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 63 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

The sixth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for extended period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner, one of the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur, has filed a writ petition praying for quashing of the demand notice and seeking direction to restrain the respondents from recovering NPV amount from the petitioner. The court has been presented with various arguments and submissions by the learned Additional Advocate General, including the fact that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has yet to make a decision on the matter.

The seventh court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases have since been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases, and to divide the common areas of transport and storage equally amongst the active mining lease holders. The court also directed appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases.
