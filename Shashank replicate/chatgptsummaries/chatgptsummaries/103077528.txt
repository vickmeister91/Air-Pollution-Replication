The Supreme Court of India recently issued a court order pertaining to multiple appeals and petitions related to the classification of land in village Karoran, District Ropar, as 'forest land' for the purpose of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The case involved a Forest Hill Golf and Country Club in Village Karoran, District Ropar, near Chandigarh, which was being developed in violation of environmental and forest laws. The High Court held that the entire land of village Karoran, which was notified under Section 3 of the PLP Act, 1900, and regulated by the prohibitory directions notified under Sections 4 and 5 of the aforesaid PLP Act, 1900, is 'forest land' and attracts the provisions of Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 if sought to be used for 'non-forest purpose'. The High Court directed the Forest Hill Golf and Country Club to immediately close down its entire enterprise and demolish all the illegally erected buildings within a period of three months and to handover the 'management' and 'control' of the land in question to the State Forest Department.

The Supreme Court set aside the finding of the High Court and remanded the matter for fresh hearing and order in accordance with the law. The court order emphasizes the need to check further deforestation and apply the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 to all forests irrespective of ownership or classification. The court held that land notified under Section 3 of the PLP Act, 1900 and regulated by orders of the local Government under Sections 4 and 5 of the PLP Act, 1900 may or may not be 'forest land'. The court also clarified the meaning of 'forest' and 'forest land' under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court order also instructs a thorough investigation into the accountability of top executives and administrative functionaries of the Punjab government and some officers of the central government regarding the establishment and development of the Forest Hill Golf and Country Club. The court also orders the formation of a special investigation team to determine the actual land ownership of Col. B.S. Sandhu and his family members. The order is being challenged by Col. B.S. Sandhu, some agriculturists, house owners, and shop owners of village Karoran, and the Bhartiya Kisan Union. The parties argue whether the entire land in village Karoran is 'forest land' and whether it can be used for non-forest purposes without the prior permission of the Central Government. The court examines the records of the Forest Department and the Annual Report of the East Punjab (Forest Department) and concludes that the land in village Karoran is recorded as land under the control of the Forest Department because the land was closed under the PLP Act, 1900. The court also notes that the High Court has taken a similar view.

The court order discusses the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and its restriction on deforestation of forest land. The court also examines the recommendations of the CEC in T.N. Godavarman's case and the basis of inclusion of land under the PLP Act, 1900 as forest land. The High Court's finding that all land in village Karoran, District Ropar, is forest land for the purpose of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the High Court for a fresh hearing and order in accordance with the law. The directions for investigation by the CBI in the impugned order are not set aside.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India's recent court order pertaining to the classification of land in village Karoran, District Ropar, as 'forest land' for the purpose of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, has set aside the High Court's finding and remanded the matter for fresh hearing and order in accordance with the law. The court has emphasized the need to check further deforestation and apply the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 to all forests irrespective of ownership or classification. The court has also ordered a thorough investigation into the accountability of top executives and administrative functionaries of the Punjab government and some officers of the central government regarding the establishment and development of the Forest Hill Golf and Country Club. The matter is being challenged by various parties, and the court has clarified the meaning of 'forest' and 'forest land' under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.
