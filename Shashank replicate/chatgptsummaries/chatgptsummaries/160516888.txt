Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This provision is meant to protect individuals from arbitrary arrest and detention by the police. In this case, Jagdishbhai Hamabhai Khambha had filed an application for anticipatory bail in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under the Gujarat Prohibition Act.

The Gujarat Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Gujarat. The act was enacted in 1961 and has been amended several times since then. The act imposes strict penalties on those who violate its provisions, including fines and imprisonment.

The court, while granting anticipatory bail to Jagdishbhai Hamabhai Khambha, has imposed certain conditions on him. These conditions include a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and cooperation with the investigation. The court has also allowed the investigating agency to file an application for police remand of the applicant if deemed necessary. Police remand is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows the police to detain a person for a certain period of time for the purpose of interrogation and investigation.

The court has also made it clear that the observations made by it while granting bail should not influence the trial court's decision. This means that the trial court will have to independently evaluate the evidence and decide whether or not to convict Jagdishbhai Hamabhai Khambha.

The grant of anticipatory bail is a significant relief for Jagdishbhai Hamabhai Khambha as it means that he will not be arrested in connection with the FIR registered against him. However, the conditions imposed by the court mean that he will have to cooperate with the investigation and may have to undergo police remand if deemed necessary.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Jagdishbhai Hamabhai Khambha in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The court has granted anticipatory bail to the applicant on certain conditions, including a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and cooperation with the investigation.
