The Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, 1953, has been the subject of several court orders in recent times. These orders have addressed various issues related to the Act, including the liability of directors, partners, managers, or secretaries of a company or partnership firm for offenses committed by the firm. This article will consolidate three court orders related to the Act.

The first court order discusses three issues related to the Act. The first issue is whether the company or partnership firm must be charged simultaneously with the director, partner, manager, or secretary for contravention of the Act. The court rules that it is not necessary. The second issue is whether the complaint must explicitly state that the accused exercised ultimate control over the firm or was in immediate charge of the general management or control thereof. The court rules that it is not necessary. The third issue is whether previous court decisions on this matter were correct, and the court rules that they were not. The court also discusses the provisions of Section 35 of the Act and the concept of vicarious criminal liability.

The second court order discusses the interpretation of Section 35 of the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act. This section imposes vicarious liability on directors, partners, managers, or secretaries of a company or partnership firm for offenses committed by the firm. The court rejects the argument that the language of Section 2(5) of the Act must be incorporated into the complaint to maintain a prosecution against the accused. The court also overrules previous judgments that took a contrary view. The court emphasizes that the administration of criminal law should not be obscured by technicalities and that the burden of proof lies with the accused to establish a lack of knowledge or due diligence in preventing the offense. The court dismisses the petition and orders the trial to proceed expeditiously.

The third court order states that for the purpose of quashing proceedings, only the allegations in the complaint need to be considered. The court found that a prima facie case had been made against the accused based on clear and explicit allegations in the complaint. The court emphasized the necessity of an indictment containing facts that justify the prosecution of an accused. The court also discussed vicarious liability and the need for evidence to support allegations against directors. Ultimately, the court found no reason to disagree with the decision of the Chief Justice in the case.

In summary, these court orders address various issues related to the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, 1953. The courts have clarified that it is not necessary to charge the company or partnership firm simultaneously with the director, partner, manager, or secretary for contravention of the Act. The courts have also emphasized that the burden of proof lies with the accused to establish a lack of knowledge or due diligence in preventing the offense.
