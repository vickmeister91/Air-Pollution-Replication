In a recent wildlife protection case, the court granted anticipatory bail to three petitioners who were accused based on a disclosure statement made by some co-villagers with whom they had previous enmity. The court found no evidence of their complicity in the alleged offense and granted bail on the condition of a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties.

The case in question pertains to the protection of wildlife, and the three petitioners were accused of being involved in an offense related to this. However, the court found that there was no evidence to support the allegations made against them. The accusations were based on a disclosure statement made by some co-villagers with whom the petitioners had a history of enmity. The court found that this statement was not reliable and could not be used as evidence against the petitioners.

In light of this, the court granted anticipatory bail to the three petitioners. This means that they will not be arrested in connection with the case, as long as they comply with the conditions set by the court. One of these conditions is that they must provide a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each, with two sureties. This is a common requirement in bail cases, and it ensures that the accused will appear in court when required.

The decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners was based on the lack of evidence against them. The court found that there was no reason to believe that they were involved in the alleged offense, and therefore, they should not be arrested. This decision is in line with the principle of innocent until proven guilty, which is a fundamental aspect of the Indian legal system.

Overall, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the three petitioners in this wildlife protection case is a positive development. It shows that the court is committed to upholding the principles of justice and fairness, and that it will not allow baseless accusations to result in the arrest of innocent people. The decision also highlights the importance of reliable evidence in legal proceedings, and the need for caution when relying on statements made by individuals with a history of enmity.
