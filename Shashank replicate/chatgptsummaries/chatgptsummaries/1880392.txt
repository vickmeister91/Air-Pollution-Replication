The case in question involves an application filed by the Kerala Financial Corporation for the sale of properties to recover a loan from the appellant. The appellant, an agriculturist, argued that her mortgaged properties were not liable to be sold. However, the court rejected this argument and ordered the sale of the properties. The appellant then appealed, arguing that even if she was an agriculturist, the properties could not be sold under the State Financial Corporations Act.

The court held that the order for sale was not a decree as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, the proviso protecting agriculturists did not apply. The court confirmed the order for sale and dismissed the appeal.

The State Financial Corporations Act provides for the establishment of financial corporations at the state level to provide financial assistance to small and medium-sized industries. The Act also provides for the recovery of loans by the financial corporations through the sale of properties mortgaged by the borrowers.

In this case, the appellant had taken a loan from the Kerala Financial Corporation and had mortgaged her properties as security for the loan. When she failed to repay the loan, the financial corporation filed an application for the sale of the properties to recover the loan amount.

The appellant argued that as an agriculturist, her mortgaged properties were not liable to be sold. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the State Financial Corporations Act did not provide any exemption for agriculturists.

The appellant then appealed, arguing that even if she was an agriculturist, the properties could not be sold under the State Financial Corporations Act. She relied on the proviso to Section 60(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that properties belonging to agriculturists cannot be sold to recover a debt.

However, the court held that the order for sale was not a decree as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, the proviso protecting agriculturists did not apply. The court noted that the State Financial Corporations Act provided for the sale of mortgaged properties to recover loans, and that this provision was not affected by the proviso to Section 60(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court confirmed the order for sale and dismissed the appeal. The appellant was directed to cooperate with the sale proceedings and to vacate the properties within a specified time.

In conclusion, the court held that the sale of properties to recover a loan under the State Financial Corporations Act was not affected by the proviso to Section 60(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court confirmed the order for sale and directed the appellant to cooperate with the sale proceedings.
