The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Laxman Singh Chahar against the District Cooperative Central Bank. The petitioner had challenged the preliminary enquiry report and suspension order against him. He claimed that the officer who prepared the report had a personal bias against him, and that the suspension order was passed by an incompetent authority. However, the court found that the preliminary enquiry report did not mean that the petitioner was guilty, and that he had already been subjected to a regular departmental enquiry where his defence would be considered. The court also found that the suspension order was passed by a competent authority, and dismissed the petition without expressing any opinion on the merits of the matter.

The case involved allegations of misconduct against Laxman Singh Chahar, an employee of the District Cooperative Central Bank. The bank had initiated a preliminary enquiry into the matter, which resulted in a report that recommended Chahar's suspension. The bank subsequently passed a suspension order against Chahar, which he challenged in court.

Chahar's main argument was that the officer who prepared the preliminary enquiry report had a personal bias against him. He claimed that the officer had a history of animosity towards him, and that this had influenced the report's findings. Chahar also argued that the suspension order was passed by an incompetent authority, as the officer who had passed it did not have the necessary authority to do so.

The court, however, was not convinced by Chahar's arguments. It noted that the preliminary enquiry report did not mean that Chahar was guilty of the allegations against him. Rather, it was merely a recommendation for further action. The court also pointed out that Chahar had already been given the opportunity to defend himself in a regular departmental enquiry, where his defence would be considered.

Regarding the suspension order, the court found that it had been passed by a competent authority. It noted that the officer who had passed the order was authorized to do so under the bank's rules and regulations. The court, therefore, dismissed Chahar's petition without expressing any opinion on the merits of the matter.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following due process in cases of alleged misconduct. It also underscores the need for impartiality and fairness in the conduct of preliminary enquiries and departmental enquiries. While the court did not express any opinion on the merits of the matter, its decision suggests that Chahar's allegations of bias and incompetence were not substantiated.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder that employees who are accused of misconduct are entitled to a fair and impartial process. It also emphasizes the importance of following established rules and regulations in such cases. While the outcome of this particular case may be disappointing for Chahar, it is a positive development for the broader principles of justice and fairness.
