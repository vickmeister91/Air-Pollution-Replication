The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Jamiat Ulama I Hind - State of Gujarat challenging the acquisition of villages in Mangrol Taluka, District Surat, which is a Scheduled Area. The petitioner has prayed for the restoration of Gaykawadi Road and not to change the said road passing from village Nani Naroli to Surali and Nani Naroli to Nogama and Nani Naroli to Vastan, and other places be not altered.

The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Samatha v/s. State of A.P. And Others reported in AIR 1997 SC Page 3297. The court directed the State Government to ensure that all industrialists concerned, be they natural or juristic persons stop forthwith mining operation within the Scheduled Area except where the lease has been granted to the State undertaking i.e. A.P.S.M.D. Corporation.

The court order states that mining operations within the Scheduled Area, except where the lease has been granted to the State undertaking, should report compliance of the order to the Registry of the Court within six months. Lessees of mining leases are directed not to break fresh mines, but they are entitled to remove minerals already extracted and stocked in the reserved forest area within four months.

The State undertaking carrying out mining operations would be subject to regulations under the Forest Conservation Act (FC Act) and the Environment Protection Act (EP Act). The State Government can organize cooperative societies composed solely of Scheduled Tribes to exploit mining operations within the Scheduled Area subject to compliance with the FC Act and the EP Act.

The court found no illegality in the mining activity undertaken by respondent No.13. The court also stated that if the petitioners are desirous, they may ventilate the grievance before the appropriate authority because it is not the case of the petitioners that the road is completely banned or there is no alternative way available.

The court order is significant as it deals with the issue of mining in Scheduled Areas, which are areas where the Scheduled Tribes have a significant population. The Scheduled Tribes are recognized as the most marginalized and vulnerable sections of the Indian society, and the Constitution of India provides for their protection and welfare.

The court has directed the State Government to ensure that all industrialists stop mining operations within the Scheduled Area except where the lease has been granted to the State undertaking. This is a significant step towards protecting the rights of the Scheduled Tribes and ensuring that their resources are not exploited by private entities.

The court has also directed the lessees of mining leases not to break fresh mines, but they are entitled to remove minerals already extracted and stocked in the reserved forest area within four months. This is a reasonable compromise that allows the lessees to recover their investment while also protecting the environment and the rights of the Scheduled Tribes.

The court has also recognized the importance of the Forest Conservation Act and the Environment Protection Act in regulating mining operations in Scheduled Areas. The State undertaking carrying out mining operations would be subject to regulations under these Acts, which would ensure that the environment is protected and the rights of the Scheduled Tribes are not violated.

The court has also recognized the importance of cooperative societies composed solely of Scheduled Tribes in exploiting mining operations within the Scheduled Area. This is a significant step towards empowering the Scheduled Tribes and ensuring that they benefit from the resources in their area.

Overall, the court order is a significant step towards protecting the rights of the Scheduled Tribes and ensuring that their resources are not exploited by private entities. The court has recognized the importance of the Forest Conservation Act and the Environment Protection Act in regulating mining operations in Scheduled Areas and has directed the State Government to ensure compliance with these Acts. The court has also recognized the importance of cooperative societies composed solely of Scheduled Tribes in exploiting mining operations within the Scheduled Area.
