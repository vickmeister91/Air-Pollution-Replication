The court order pertains to various petitions filed by agricultural laborers seeking the quashing of a notification and government resolution related to forest land encroachments. The petitioners allege that the state government acted arbitrarily and unreasonably by not implementing a policy decision taken by the erstwhile bilingual State of Bombay. The court notes that the matter had previously been dismissed by a Division Bench and that the petitioners had approached the Supreme Court, which granted them two weeks to show cause to the Range forest officer against a notice dated January 13, 1997.

The court hears several contentions raised by the petitioners, including that cultivation in forest land is not totally prohibited but requires permission from the Central Government. The court finds that the petitioners have not been able to show any illegality or irregularity in the notification and government resolution. The court also notes that the petitioners have not been able to show that they have any right to cultivate on the forest land in question.

In another case, the court order pertains to a representation made by the petitioners to the State Government to forward to the Central Government for appropriate decision, but the State Government failed to do so. The court finds the State Government's action to be arbitrary, illegal, and orders them to forward the representation to the Central Government. The court also finds errors in the Deputy Conservator of Forest's order and rejects the claim that the land was a forest area. The court does not grant the petitioners' request for possession regularization by the State or Central Government. The court also issues general directions to all State Governments for the protection and preservation of forests.

The court order also prohibits any activity that violates the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and orders the cessation of such activities. It also imposes a ban on felling trees in certain areas and the closure of saw mills in those areas. The felling of trees in all forests is suspended except in accordance with the Working Plans of the State Governments. The order also bans the movement of cut trees and timber from the seven North Eastern States to any other state in the country, except for certified timber required for defense or other government purposes.

Each State Government is directed to constitute an Expert Committee to identify forests, degraded areas, and plantation trees. The order is to remain in operation until further orders and must be complied with by all concerned, notwithstanding any order at variance made by any authority. The court also directs that workers employed in saw mills or other wood-based industries that are closed pursuant to this order will continue to be paid their full emoluments due and shall not be retrenched or removed from service for this reason.

In yet another case, the court order states that the petitioners cannot be granted possession of their land as per the directions of the Supreme Court and Godavarman Thirumulkapad. The court also states that no direction can be issued to the State or Central Government for regularisation of possession. However, the authorities cannot dispossess the petitioners except in accordance with the law. The petitions are partly allowed and the rule is made absolute to the extent mentioned. No costs are awarded.

Overall, the court orders deal with various issues related to forest land encroachments, protection and preservation of forests, and the rights of agricultural laborers. The court emphasizes the importance of following the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and taking appropriate measures to protect and preserve forests. The court also recognizes the rights of agricultural laborers and directs the State and Central Governments to take appropriate action in accordance with the law.
