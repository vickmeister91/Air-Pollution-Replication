The court recently rejected Lokam's second application for bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. Lokam had been arrested in connection with a forest crime and was charged with offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant's counsel argued that there was no progress in the trial because one of the accused persons was still absconding. However, the court found that since the co-accused was still absconding, it could not be said that there was delay on the part of the prosecution.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading in wild animals and plants. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas.

Lokam's case is related to a forest crime, which means that he was involved in some illegal activity related to the forest. The exact nature of the crime is not clear from the available information. However, it is clear that Lokam was charged with offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

Lokam had applied for bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., which provides for the grant of bail to a person who has been arrested in a non-bailable offense. The section states that the court may grant bail if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offense and that he is not likely to commit any offense while on bail.

Lokam's counsel argued that there was no progress in the trial because one of the accused persons was still absconding. This means that one of the persons who was involved in the crime along with Lokam was still at large and had not been arrested. The counsel argued that this delay was causing hardship to Lokam, who had been in custody for a long time.

However, the court rejected this argument and held that since the co-accused was still absconding, it could not be said that there was delay on the part of the prosecution. The court observed that the prosecution had made efforts to arrest the co-accused, but he was still at large. The court also noted that Lokam had not been able to provide any new grounds for his release on bail.

The court's decision to reject Lokam's bail application is in line with the principles of criminal law. The court has to balance the interests of the accused with those of the society. In this case, the court found that Lokam's release on bail would not be in the interest of society, as he was charged with offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which is a serious offense.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in protecting the environment and wildlife. The act provides for the protection of endangered species and their habitats. It also provides for the punishment of those who violate its provisions. The court's decision to reject Lokam's bail application sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate any illegal activity related to wildlife.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Lokam's second bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. is a reminder of the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in protecting the environment and wildlife. The court's decision is in line with the principles of criminal law and highlights the need to balance the interests of the accused with those of the society. The court's decision also sends a strong message that the law will not tolerate any illegal activity related to wildlife.
