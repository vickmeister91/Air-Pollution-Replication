The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Ali Sher, seeking to quash an order passed by the Special Environment Court, Kurukshetra. The order had confiscated his truck for carrying Khairwood from protected forest areas. The court observed that there is no provision under the Wild Life Act for the release of the seized property and that the truck could only be considered for release under Section 451 Cr.P.C.

The petitioner, Ali Sher, was not one of the co-accused who had carried the wood in the truck in question. Instead, he was the owner of the truck, which had been given on rent by him to the co-accused. The court quashed the order and directed the respondents to release the vehicle of the petitioner as he is the owner of the vehicle.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal provisions related to the confiscation and release of seized property. The Wild Life Act, which governs the protection of wildlife and forests in India, does not provide for the release of seized property. Instead, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) provides for the release of seized property under Section 451.

In this case, the court correctly applied the provisions of the Cr.P.C and directed the release of the truck to its rightful owner. The petitioner, Ali Sher, was not involved in the illegal transportation of Khairwood and had only rented out his truck to the co-accused. Therefore, it would have been unjust to confiscate his property.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of due diligence when renting out property. As the owner of the truck, Ali Sher had a responsibility to ensure that his property was not being used for illegal activities. While he may not have been directly involved in the transportation of Khairwood, he could have taken steps to ensure that his truck was not being used for illegal purposes.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the legal provisions related to the confiscation and release of seized property. It also highlights the need for due diligence when renting out property to ensure that it is not being used for illegal activities.
