The Kutchjilla Machhimar Association, a group of fishermen, filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court against the proposed setting up of a power plant at Bhadreshwar in Kutch district. The Association argued that the proposed power plant would have a significant impact on the environment and the livelihoods of the local fishermen. They requested that the respondents hold a public hearing after re-verification of location and project site, supply of supplementary EIA Report and Marine Draft EIA Report as per Notifications dated 14.09.2006 and 19.02.1991 issued under the Environment Protection Act.

The court ordered that the Environmental Impact Assessment Authority of the State should make spot verification before issuance of Environmental Clearance Certificate and submit its opinion/report. The court recognized the importance of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in ensuring that development projects do not have a negative impact on the environment. The court also recognized the importance of public participation in the EIA process, as it allows for the concerns of local communities to be taken into account.

The court ordered that the Environmental Impact Assessment Authority of the State should make spot verification before issuance of Environmental Clearance Certificate and submit its opinion/report. This means that the Authority will have to physically visit the proposed site of the power plant and assess the potential impact of the project on the environment. The Authority will then have to submit a report to the court, which will be taken into account when deciding whether to grant an Environmental Clearance Certificate.

The court also gave the petitioner-Association the liberty to point out any infirmities in the EIA Report submitted by the 11th respondent. This means that the Association can raise any concerns they have about the EIA Report and request that the Environmental Impact Assessment Authority of the State give a hearing after verification of location and project site. This will allow the Association to have their concerns heard and taken into account in the decision-making process.

Overall, the court's order is a positive development for the Kutchjilla Machhimar Association and the local community. It recognizes the importance of the EIA process and public participation in ensuring that development projects do not have a negative impact on the environment and local communities. The court's order also ensures that the Environmental Impact Assessment Authority of the State will have to physically visit the proposed site of the power plant and assess the potential impact of the project on the environment. This will help to ensure that the project is developed in a sustainable and responsible manner.
