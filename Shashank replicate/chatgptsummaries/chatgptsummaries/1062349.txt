The court order pertains to an appeal against the dismissal of a compensation case by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The claimant had filed a previous compensation case which was dismissed in default, and a subsequent restoration application was also dismissed for non-compliance. The claimant then filed a fresh compensation case which was opposed by the respondents on the grounds of maintainability and res judicata. The Claims Tribunal allowed the preliminary objection and dismissed the case.

The High Court considered the procedures provided under Order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and concluded that a fresh suit is maintainable after dismissal under Rule 2 or Rule 3 of Order 9 CPC, but not after dismissal under Rule 8 of Order 9 CPC. The court cited previous cases to support this conclusion.

The court order discusses the options available to a plaintiff after the dismissal of a suit under Order 9 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Code. The plaintiff can either file a fresh suit or apply for restoration of the suit. The court also clarifies that the principle of res judicata does not apply to a dismissal of a suit or application in default under Rule 2 or Rule 3 of Order 9 CPC, as it does not fulfill the requirement of an adjudication or a decree. The court sets aside the impugned order and remands the matter back to the Tribunal for a decision on merit.
