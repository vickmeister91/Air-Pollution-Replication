The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a Special Criminal Application to challenge an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Savli, which had discharged the accused persons for offences under Sections 43 and 44 read with 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner argued that the decision of the learned Single Judge, which had been relied upon by both the lower courts, had been set aside by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Gujarat Pollution Control Board V/s. Nicosulf Industries & Exports Private Limited and others reported 2009(2) SCC 171. The Supreme Court had held that the grant of sanction to file the complaint would be in law and authorisation to file the complaint would be valid if it was given by the State Board.

The court allowed the application and quashed and set aside the orders passed by both the lower courts. The court directed the concerned Magistrate to proceed further with the case in accordance with the law and on merits. This decision is significant as it reinforces the importance of obtaining proper authorisation from the State Board before filing a complaint under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of State Pollution Control Boards and Central Pollution Control Board to prevent and control water pollution. The Act also provides for the regulation of the discharge of pollutants into water bodies and the treatment of sewage and other wastes.

Section 43 of the Act deals with the prohibition of the discharge of pollutants into streams or wells. Section 44 of the Act deals with the prohibition of the use of stream or well for disposal of polluting matter. Section 47 of the Act deals with the penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act.

The case of Gujarat Pollution Control Board V/s. Nicosulf Industries & Exports Private Limited and others reported 2009(2) SCC 171 is an important precedent in this area of law. In this case, the Supreme Court had held that the grant of sanction to file the complaint would be in law and authorisation to file the complaint would be valid if it was given by the State Board. The Supreme Court had also held that the State Board had the power to delegate its power to grant sanction to file a complaint to its officers.

The decision of the court in the present case reinforces the importance of obtaining proper authorisation from the State Board before filing a complaint under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court has also directed the concerned Magistrate to proceed further with the case in accordance with the law and on merits.
