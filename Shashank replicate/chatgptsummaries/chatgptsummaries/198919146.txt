The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, which recognizes the rights of forest dwellers and tribal communities to their traditional lands and resources. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Pramod K.P and two others against the State of Kerala and other respondents. The petitioners had submitted applications to the Forest Range Officer for recognition of their forest rights under the Act. The court heard the case on November 30, 2017, and delivered its judgment on December 21, 2017. The order includes a list of exhibits submitted by the petitioners, including copies of their applications, government orders, and certificates.

The second court order pertains to a group of tribal/forest dwellers who were denied permission to cut and remove trees from their settlement area. The petitioners claimed their right to do so under the Act. The court examines the legislative history related to conservation of forest land and the nature of the rights devolved upon forest dwellers. The court notes that the Act recognizes traditional forest dwellers as integral to the survival and sustainability of the forest ecosystem and confers certain enumerated forest rights, but does not contemplate any assignment of land in favor of such class of persons. The court ultimately rules in favor of the petitioners, allowing them to cut and remove trees for the construction of residential houses and other specified purposes.

The third court order establishes the Forest Right Committee as the route for forest dwellers to claim their rights under the Forest Rights Act. The Act confers two types of rights: community and individual. The claim of the petitioners in the case is based on individual rights, but the assignment of forest rights to forest dwellers does not include ownership or possession of the land. The State continues to hold ownership and possession of the land, and forest dwellers can only cut and remove trees in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Act permits the felling of trees for specific purposes, but only in accordance with its provisions. The court notes that certain rights are given to individuals under the Act.

The fourth court order pertains to Act 2/2007 and Act 69/1980, which give certain rights to individuals regarding forest land. Section 3(a) of Act 2/2007 allows individuals to hold forest land for self-cultivation for livelihood, and they can cut and remove trees they have planted for this purpose. However, felling of trees is only permitted in accordance with other provisions of the Act. The forest rights conferred upon dwellers are in the nature of permissions to occupy the forest land and use it for the purpose for which permissions are granted. The government cannot issue any order permitting felling of trees contrary to the Act 69/1980 without previous approval of the Central Government. The court directs the Chief Conservator of Forests to take a decision on the claim of the petitioners and permit them to cut and remove trees which were planted as part of self-cultivation. The government orders issued contrary to law declared by this court shall be withdrawn by the government.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of recognizing the rights of forest dwellers and tribal communities to their traditional lands and resources. The Forest Rights Act confers certain enumerated forest rights to forest dwellers, but does not contemplate any assignment of land in favor of such class of persons. The Act permits the felling of trees for specific purposes, but only in accordance with its provisions. The court orders direct the Chief Conservator of Forests to take a decision on the claim of the petitioners and permit them to cut and remove trees which were planted as part of self-cultivation. The government orders issued contrary to law declared by this court shall be withdrawn by the government.
