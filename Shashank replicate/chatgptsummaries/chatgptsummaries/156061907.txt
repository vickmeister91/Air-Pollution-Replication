The Gujarat High Court recently heard a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in which the applicant, an accused in a complaint filed by a bank for an offence punishable under section 138 of the N.I. Act, sought to quash the complaint and all consequential proceedings. The applicant argued that as an independent director of the accused company, he was not responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the management of the company. The court considered whether the applicant, as a director, was responsible for the dishonour of the cheque issued by the company. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a case involving the liability of a director of a company under Section 141 of the Act. The court cites a previous Supreme Court case to explain the law and ultimately determines whether the complaint against the applicant-accused should be quashed. The court also discusses the specific facts of the case and the legal issues that arise, including the requirements for averments in a complaint against a director of a company.

The court order explains the requirements for holding a person liable under Section 141 of the Companies Act. It states that a person accused must be in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company at the time of the offense, and this must be specifically averred in the complaint. Merely being a director of a company is not enough to make a person liable. The court also emphasizes the need for specific allegations in the complaint showing how and in what manner the accused directors were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business. The order cites several previous cases to support these points.

The court order states that in order to prosecute alleged directors of a company, there must be a specific allegation in the complaint as to their part played in the transaction. Only those who were in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offense can be held liable. The court has made it clear that specific averments have to be made against the accused Director. The order cites several cases to support this position.

The court order discusses the requirements for making a company's directors vicariously liable for the company's criminal actions. The court notes that specific averments must be made in the complaint to make the accused directors liable, and that not all directors are automatically liable. The court also outlines the types of directors who can be held responsible for the company's conduct, and emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with the requirements of Section 141 of the Companies Act.

The court order discusses the principle of vicarious liability in cases of dishonored cheques. It states that those in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time can be held liable. It also notes that if the accused is a managing director or joint managing director, it is not necessary to make specific averments in the complaint, and they can be held liable by virtue of their position. The court cites previous cases to explain the liability of companies and their directors for committing the offense of dishonored cheques.

The court order explains the vicarious liability of persons connected to a company that commits an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The Act states that if a company commits an offence, every person responsible for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company itself, shall be deemed guilty of the offence. The court emphasizes that a complaint must disclose the act committed by the directors from which a reasonable inference of their vicarious liability can be drawn. The court also explains the specific conditions under which a person can be held liable under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 141. The court stresses the importance of strict compliance with the requirements of Section 141 and the need to aver consent, connivance, or negligence on the part of the person being held liable.

The court order discusses the legal requirements for determining who can be held responsible for the conduct of a company's business. The court cites various sections of different acts and ultimately concludes that only certain individuals, such as managing directors, whole-time directors, managers, and secretaries, can be held responsible for a company's conduct. The court emphasizes that being a director or officer of a company does not automatically make one responsible for its conduct, and that both legal and factual requirements must be met for a person to be held vicariously liable under section 141(1) of the Act.

The court order discusses the liability of individuals under Section 141 of the Act for dishonored cheques. It states that even officers who were not in charge of the company's business can be made liable under sub-section (2) of Section 141. The order also outlines the requirements for making a person liable under Section 141(1) and (2) and notes that not all officers of a company can be made liable under sub-section (1) of section 141. The court emphasizes that it is not proper to subject all and sundry to be impleaded as accused in a complaint against a company, even when the requirements of section 138 read and section 141 of the Act are not fulfilled. The court also cites a Supreme Court ruling that inherent powers of the court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised only in cases where the Court finds an abuse of the process of law.
