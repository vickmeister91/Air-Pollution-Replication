The Gauhati High Court recently issued an order in the case of M/S T. G. Enterprise vs New Socunoma Village and 6 Ors. The petitioner had challenged a judgment that required consent from the Chairman of the Council, rather than the Head Gaon Burah, for setting up a Stone Crusher Unit. The court has called upon the Nagaland Pollution Control Board to file a reply on whether consent from the Council is required, and directed the State of Nagaland to file a reply on who would be the competent authority to grant consent.

The case revolves around the establishment of a Stone Crusher Unit in New Socunoma Village. The petitioner, M/S T. G. Enterprise, had applied for consent to establish the unit from the Head Gaon Burah, who is the traditional village headman. However, the Chairman of the Council, which is a local governing body, had issued a letter stating that the consent of the Council was required instead. The petitioner challenged this decision in court, arguing that the Chairman of the Council did not have the authority to require consent from the Council.

The Gauhati High Court has now called upon the Nagaland Pollution Control Board to clarify whether consent from the Council is required for the establishment of the Stone Crusher Unit. The court has also directed the State of Nagaland to file a reply on who would be the competent authority to grant consent. This is an important issue, as it will determine who has the power to grant permission for the establishment of such units in the future.

In addition, the court has directed the petitioner to serve all respondents through ordinary and dasti process. This means that the petitioner must serve notice of the court proceedings to all parties involved in the case, using both regular and expedited methods. The issue of stay will be considered on the next date of listing. This means that the court will decide whether to put a hold on the proceedings until a later date, or to continue with the case as scheduled.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of clarifying the authority and process for granting consent for the establishment of Stone Crusher Units in Nagaland. The decision will have implications for future cases, and will determine who has the power to make such decisions. The court has taken a proactive approach by calling upon the relevant authorities to provide clarification, and by directing the petitioner to serve notice to all parties involved. The issue of stay will be considered at a later date, once all parties have had a chance to respond to the court's directives.
