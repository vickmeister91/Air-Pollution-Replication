The court order in question pertains to two writ petitions filed by Kallai Saw Mills and T.R. Saw Mills against the State of Tamil Nadu. The petitioners were running saw mills with valid licenses but were ordered to shut down by the authorities without prior notice. The State argued that the saw mills were in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Supreme Court's directions in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad Vs. Union of India case.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to conserve forests and wildlife in India. The act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the central government. The T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad Vs. Union of India case was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of India issued directions to protect forests and wildlife in the country. The court directed that all forest areas, irrespective of their legal status, be treated as "deemed forests" and be protected accordingly.

In the present case, the petitioners argued that they were running saw mills on private land and were not violating any forest laws. They contended that the authorities had shut down their saw mills without giving them any prior notice or opportunity to be heard. The petitioners requested the court to allow them to continue running their saw mills.

The State, on the other hand, argued that the saw mills were located in areas that were classified as "deemed forests" and were therefore in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Supreme Court's directions in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad Vs. Union of India case. The State submitted that the authorities had acted in accordance with the law and had shut down the saw mills to protect the forests and wildlife in the area.

The court, after hearing both sides, did not interfere with the impugned orders but directed the authorities to consider the grievances of the petitioners in accordance with the statutory provisions and pass appropriate orders after affording reasonable opportunity to the petitioners. The court observed that the authorities had not followed the due process of law and had shut down the saw mills without giving the petitioners any prior notice or opportunity to be heard. The court directed the authorities to rectify this and to consider the petitioners' grievances in accordance with the law.

The court also rejected the request of the petitioners to continue running the saw mills. The court observed that the petitioners were running saw mills in areas that were classified as "deemed forests" and were therefore in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Supreme Court's directions in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad Vs. Union of India case. The court held that the protection of forests and wildlife was of paramount importance and that the petitioners could not be allowed to continue running their saw mills in violation of the law.

In conclusion, the court order in the Kallai Saw Mills and T.R. Saw Mills case highlights the importance of following due process of law and affording reasonable opportunity to be heard. The court directed the authorities to consider the grievances of the petitioners in accordance with the statutory provisions and pass appropriate orders. However, the court also upheld the importance of protecting forests and wildlife and rejected the request of the petitioners to continue running their saw mills in violation of the law.
