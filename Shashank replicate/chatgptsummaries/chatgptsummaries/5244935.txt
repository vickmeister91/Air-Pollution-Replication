In a recent court order, four applicants who were arrested on 2nd February 2018 in connection with a wildlife protection act case have been granted bail. The applicants were accused of attempting to capture a wild animal with the help of dogs and were found to be armed with weapons. The court has allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety each of the same amount. Additionally, the applicants are to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The act has been amended several times over the years to strengthen its provisions and ensure better protection for wildlife.

In this case, the applicants were accused of violating the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act by attempting to capture a wild animal with the help of dogs and being armed with weapons. The act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, and also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any part or product derived from a wild animal. The act also provides for penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is significant, as it allows them to be released from custody while the case is ongoing. Bail is a legal provision that allows a person to be released from custody while awaiting trial or other legal proceedings. Bail is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court when required and will not engage in any further criminal activity.

In this case, the court has directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety each of the same amount. A bail bond is a legal document that guarantees the appearance of the accused in court. The surety is a person who agrees to be responsible for the accused and ensure that they appear in court when required. The court has also directed the applicants to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C.

Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C. provides for certain conditions that must be met when granting bail in non-bailable offenses. Non-bailable offenses are those offenses for which bail cannot be granted as a matter of right, and the accused must apply to the court for bail. The section provides that when granting bail in non-bailable offenses, the court may impose certain conditions, such as requiring the accused to surrender their passport, report to the police station regularly, or not leave the jurisdiction of the court without permission.

In this case, the court has not specified any additional conditions for granting bail to the applicants, apart from the bail bond and surety. This suggests that the court does not consider the applicants to be a flight risk or a danger to society, and believes that they will comply with the conditions of bail.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the applicants in this wildlife protection act case is significant, as it allows them to be released from custody while the case is ongoing. The court has directed the applicants to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C. and has required them to furnish a bail bond and surety. The case highlights the importance of the Wildlife Protection Act in protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the need for strict enforcement of its provisions.
