The Bihar State Mineral Development Corporation challenged an order by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest to stop mining operations on lands measuring 86 acres in two villages, claiming they were not forest lands. The Corporation argued that the land was acquired through land acquisition proceedings for the use of Farakka Barrage and was transferred to them for mining operations. However, the Divisional Forest Officer claimed that the land was declared protected forest by the forest department and was legally constituted as protected forest land. 

The case was brought before the court, which held that the land was indeed forest land and that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, applied to all forests, irrespective of ownership. The court stated that the lease could not be renewed without prior approval of the Central Government, and the lessee had no right to continue mining operations without such approval. The court order was supported by a previous case and directed the petitioner to stop mining operations in accordance with the law. The writ application was dismissed and there was no order as to costs.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which aims to conserve forests and wildlife. The Act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act defines forest land as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and any land that is not recorded as forest but is classified as forest in the government records. 

In this case, the Divisional Forest Officer claimed that the land in question was declared protected forest by the forest department and was legally constituted as protected forest land. The court agreed with this claim and held that the land was indeed forest land. The court also held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, applied to all forests, irrespective of ownership. 

The Bihar State Mineral Development Corporation argued that the land was acquired through land acquisition proceedings for the use of Farakka Barrage and was transferred to them for mining operations. However, the court held that the acquisition of land did not change its status as forest land. The court stated that the lease could not be renewed without prior approval of the Central Government, and the lessee had no right to continue mining operations without such approval. 

The court's decision has significant implications for the mining industry in India. It reinforces the importance of environmental protection and conservation of forests and wildlife. It also highlights the need for strict adherence to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the requirement for prior approval of the Central Government for any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a significant step towards environmental protection and conservation of forests and wildlife. It reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the requirement for prior approval of the Central Government for any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The decision has significant implications for the mining industry in India and highlights the need for sustainable development practices that take into account the environmental impact of mining operations.
