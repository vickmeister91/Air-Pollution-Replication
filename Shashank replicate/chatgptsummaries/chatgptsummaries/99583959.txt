The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner, Rajesh Patel, was suspended from his job as Deputy Director (Accounts) due to his involvement in a criminal case. The petitioner had requested an increase in his subsistence allowance from 50% to 75%, which was denied by the respondents. The petitioner had approached the court to challenge this decision.

The court analyzed the relevant statute, FR 53, which governs subsistence allowance during suspension, and held that the employer is obligated to consider the revision of subsistence allowance after 90 days of suspension, regardless of whether the suspension is due to a departmental inquiry or a criminal case. The court also cited previous judgments to support its decision.

The court order states that the judgments of Amit Biswas and Pradeep Kumar Mitra are not applicable to the present case. The employer is obligated to consider the revision of subsistence allowance after 90 days of suspension in cases of departmental inquiry and criminal cases.

The petitioner's application for enhancement of subsistence allowance was rejected because he did not assert that the delay in the criminal case was not attributable to him. The employer cannot be held responsible for the delay in the criminal case and it is the employee's duty to state the reasons for the delay accurately.

The petitioner is given the liberty to file a comprehensive representation with copies of the proceedings of the criminal court to show that the delay is not attributable to him. The employer must examine the application expeditiously within 30 days. The petition is disposed of with no cost.
