The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various companies and individuals against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions involve disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015.

The first court order lists the details of the petitions and their respective petitioners and respondents. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the marble and mineral industry. The order also mentions the lawyers representing the petitioner and respondent parties. However, no specific details or outcomes of the petitions are provided.

The second court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of NPV. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment. The court reviewed the facts of the case and the relevant policies and regulations before making its decision.

The third court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

The fourth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The fifth court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of NPV for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders were required to pay a total NPV amount of Rs. 17,59,06,000/- for the entire area, but 62 mining leases have since been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, excluding the 62 mining leases, and to divide the common areas of transport and storage equally amongst the active mining lease holders. The court also directed appropriate relinquishment proceedings for the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases.

In summary, the court orders involve disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the deposit of NPV under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Ordinance, 2015. The court heard multiple civil writ petitions filed by various companies and individuals against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials.
