The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Satish Kumar and others. The petitioners had requested to withdraw their writ petition with the liberty to move an appropriate application before the learned Single Judge raising all the pleas, which have been raised in the instant petition. The court has ordered accordingly and the judgment should be reported in the digest.

The writ petition in question was likely filed by the petitioners in order to seek relief from the court on a particular matter. However, for reasons that are not clear, the petitioners have now requested to withdraw their petition. The court has granted this request, but has also given the petitioners the liberty to move an appropriate application before the learned Single Judge raising all the pleas that were raised in the original petition.

It is not clear what the nature of the pleas raised in the original petition were, but it is likely that they were related to some legal issue or dispute that the petitioners were facing. By granting the petitioners the liberty to move an appropriate application before the learned Single Judge, the court has essentially given them the opportunity to pursue their case further if they so choose.

It is important to note that the court's order does not necessarily mean that the petitioners have given up on their case. Rather, it simply means that they have chosen to withdraw their writ petition for the time being, but may choose to pursue the matter further in the future.

Overall, the court's order in this case is relatively straightforward. The petitioners have been granted the liberty to move an appropriate application before the learned Single Judge, and the judgment should be reported in the digest. It remains to be seen whether the petitioners will choose to pursue their case further, but the court's order has given them the opportunity to do so if they wish.
