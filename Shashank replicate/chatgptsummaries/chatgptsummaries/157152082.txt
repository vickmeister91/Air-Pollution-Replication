The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Hindustan Copper Limited against the Union of India and its Ministry of Environment and Forests. The petitioner is seeking relief from an order contained in a letter dated 07.04.2014, which informed the petitioner that further action on its proposal would be taken after a response from the petitioner and the state government are received, and in the meantime, the proposal has been de-listed from the pending list. The petitioner is engaged in the business of raising copper ore from Surda Copper Mines, and the court heard arguments from both parties regarding the legality of the Ministry of Environment and Forests' decision.

The court order discusses a case involving a mining company that continued its operations without a valid environmental clearance, which is considered a violation. The company argued that it did not need clearance for the renewal of its mining lease, but the court found that it was required under a circular issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court also noted ambiguity in the procedure for dealing with violation cases and emphasized the need to consider each case on its merits.

The court order states that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) must process proposals for environmental clearance regardless of alleged violations, and that independent action can be taken for any violations. The court also notes that the MoEF's procedures may be illegal and arbitrary, and that the applicant must have knowledge of the procedure for processing their application. The court also discusses the applicability of environmental clearance requirements to existing mining operations and notes that the petitioner's unit is not a polluting unit. The MoEF is criticized for not following its own guidelines in the case.

The court order states that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) did not follow its own procedures before concluding that a company had violated environmental laws. The court found that the procedure adopted by the MoEF was illegal and unconstitutional, and that the requirement for the company to submit an affidavit admitting to the violation was self-incriminating. The court also found that the condition stipulated under Para 5 (ii) violated the basic principle of the rule of law. The court ordered that the MoEF cannot insist on the submission of an undertaking in terms of Para 5 (i) and that the consideration of a proposal for environment clearance cannot await the initiation of action against the project proponent.

The court order states that the rights of the people should not be put into a water-tight compartment and mandamus should be easily available to reach injustice whenever it is found. The conditions under paragraph no. 5(i) and 5(ii) of OM dated 12.12.2012 are illegal and unconstitutional and cannot be enforced against the petitioner-company. The petitioner is the only vertically integrated public sector in India and abrupt closure of mines may turn out to be catastrophic. The proposal of the petitioner-company for environmental clearance must be examined on its merits, independent of any proposed action for the alleged violation of the environmental laws. The impugned order dated 07.04.2014 is liable to be quashed and the respondent no. 1 is directed to prescribe the Terms of Reference for environment clearance for capacity expansion and renewal of mining lease of Surda Copper Mines, forthwith.
