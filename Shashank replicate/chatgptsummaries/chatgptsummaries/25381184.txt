The Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary, located in Tamil Nadu, was declared an eco-sensitive zone under Section 26A1(b) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The Nature Care Trust filed a writ petition challenging this declaration, claiming that it was made without following the provisions of the Act and against the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court. The petitioner also argued that the declaration would negatively impact the livelihoods of the 6 lakh people living in and around the sanctuary.

The District Forest Officer denied the allegations and stated that the sanctuary was declared only within the reserved forest area. However, the court order dismissed the writ petition and upheld the declaration of the sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone. The court noted that the declaration was made following guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and a committee meeting held in 2014. The court also cited a previous order by the Hon'ble Apex Court in WP.No.460 of 2004, which directed the declaration of eco-sensitive zones around sanctuaries and national parks.

The court order further listed the names and addresses of three District Forest Officers in Kodaikanal, Dindigul, and Theni districts, and referenced a case number (W.P.(MD)No.652 of 2015) and two motion petition numbers (M.P.(MD)Nos.2 and 3 of 2015). The court also noted that the declaration excluded areas important for tourism and that the livelihoods of people in and around the sanctuary would not be affected.

The declaration of the Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone is a significant step towards protecting the biodiversity of the region. Eco-sensitive zones are areas around protected areas like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and reserve forests, where human activities are regulated to minimize their impact on the environment. These zones are crucial for maintaining the ecological balance of the region and protecting the flora and fauna.

The court's decision to uphold the declaration of the sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone is a positive development for the environment and the people living in and around the sanctuary. The declaration will help regulate human activities in the region and prevent further damage to the ecosystem. The exclusion of areas important for tourism from the declaration also ensures that the local economy is not adversely affected.

However, it is important to note that the livelihoods of people living in and around the sanctuary should not be ignored. The government should take steps to ensure that the declaration does not negatively impact their livelihoods. The government can provide alternative livelihood options to the people, such as eco-tourism, which can generate income while also protecting the environment.

In conclusion, the court's decision to uphold the declaration of the Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone is a positive step towards protecting the environment and preserving the biodiversity of the region. The government should take steps to ensure that the livelihoods of people living in and around the sanctuary are not adversely affected by the declaration. The declaration of eco-sensitive zones around protected areas is crucial for maintaining the ecological balance of the region and protecting the flora and fauna.
