The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (FastTrack), Bhopal. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 254(2) read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. requesting that the record of the Income Tax Department regarding documents seized from the complainant be called for. However, the learned trial Court dismissed the application on the grounds that the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the complainant and accused had already been executed in evidence, and therefore, the record of the income tax department was not necessary to be called.

The petitioner's counsel cited judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court and Madras High Court in support of their argument. However, the respondent's counsel argued that the application filed for production of the same documents had already been rejected by the learned trial Court, and therefore, the second application was not maintainable. Ultimately, the court dismissed the petition.

The petitioner's argument was based on the fact that the record of the Income Tax Department was necessary to establish the authenticity of the documents seized from the complainant. They argued that the MOU between the complainant and accused did not establish the authenticity of the documents, and therefore, the record of the Income Tax Department was necessary to be called for.

The respondent's argument, on the other hand, was based on the fact that the application for production of the same documents had already been rejected by the learned trial Court. They argued that the second application was not maintainable, and therefore, the petition should be dismissed.

The court ultimately sided with the respondent, dismissing the petition. The court's decision was based on the fact that the application for production of the same documents had already been rejected by the learned trial Court. The court held that the second application was not maintainable, and therefore, the petition was dismissed.
