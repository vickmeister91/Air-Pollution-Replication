The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri R Praveen Chandra against the Union of India, the State of Karnataka, and the Director of Mines and Geology. The petitioner challenged an order passed by the first respondent under sub-section (1) of Section 4A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which granted approval for premature termination of the mining lease granted to the petitioner by the second respondent.

The petitioner argued that the order was passed without giving him an opportunity to be heard and without any reasons being assigned. The petitioner also contended that the order was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice and was arbitrary and discriminatory.

The court held that the order was passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard and without any reasons being assigned.
