The court order in question pertains to a case involving C B Upasani Jyoti Om Chemical Research and seven other petitioners versus the Union of India through the Secretary and one other respondent. The order sets a date for the case to appear in court and grants interim relief until further orders. 

The case revolves around an Office Memorandum issued by Dr. Rastogi, and the court is waiting for the respondent to file an appropriate affidavit showing that Dr. Rastogi has the authority to issue the memorandum in question. 

The petitioners have alleged that the memorandum is illegal and arbitrary, and that it violates their fundamental rights. They have also claimed that the memorandum was issued without any consultation or discussion with the stakeholders, and that it has caused them significant financial losses. 

The interim relief granted by the court is aimed at preventing any further harm to the petitioners until the case is heard in full. The court has also directed the respondent to file their affidavit within a specified time frame, failing which the court may take appropriate action. 

It is worth noting that the court order does not make any final determination on the merits of the case. Rather, it is a procedural order that sets the stage for the case to be heard in full. The court will have to consider the arguments of both parties and make a final determination on the legality of the memorandum and its impact on the petitioners. 

Overall, the court order is an important step in the legal process, as it sets a date for the case to be heard and provides interim relief to the petitioners. It remains to be seen how the case will unfold, and what the final outcome will be.
