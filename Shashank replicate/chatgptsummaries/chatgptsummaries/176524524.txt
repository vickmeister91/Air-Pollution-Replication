The case in question involves an application filed by the petitioner under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for the purpose of calling certain documents, namely CCTV footage, which had already been seized on the direction of the court. The application was dismissed on the grounds that, at the time of the framing of charges, only documents produced by the prosecution could be considered, and that the charges had not yet been framed at the time of the application.

The petitioner subsequently withdrew the petition, but was granted the liberty to refresh his prayer before the trial court after the framing of charges. The present petition was dismissed as withdrawn, with the aforementioned liberty.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the production of documents or other things that are necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of such documents or things, either to the person in whose possession they are or to any other person who can produce them.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought the production of CCTV footage that had already been seized on the direction of the court. However, the application was dismissed on the grounds that, at the time of the framing of charges, only documents produced by the prosecution could be considered.

The framing of charges is a crucial stage in a criminal trial, as it is at this stage that the court determines whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial. The charges are framed based on the evidence produced by the prosecution, and the accused is given an opportunity to respond to the charges.

In the present case, the charges had not yet been framed at the time of the application, and therefore the court held that the documents sought by the petitioner could not be considered. The petitioner subsequently withdrew the petition, but was granted the liberty to refresh his prayer before the trial court after the framing of charges.

The liberty granted to the petitioner allows him to make the same application again before the trial court, once the charges have been framed. This means that the petitioner will have another opportunity to seek the production of the CCTV footage, provided that the court is satisfied that the documents are necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial.

In conclusion, the present case involves an application filed by the petitioner under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for the production of CCTV footage that had already been seized on the direction of the court. The application was dismissed on the grounds that, at the time of the framing of charges, only documents produced by the prosecution could be considered. The petitioner subsequently withdrew the petition, but was granted the liberty to refresh his prayer before the trial court after the framing of charges. The present petition was dismissed as withdrawn, with the aforementioned liberty.
