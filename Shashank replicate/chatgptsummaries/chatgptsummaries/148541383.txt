The court has granted bail to Vishambhar, who was arrested in connection with FIR No. 79/2008 for various offences under IPC and the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner had surrendered before the trial court on 15.04.2018 and has been behind bars since then. The court has allowed the bail application and ordered that the accused-petitioner be released on bail provided he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial Judge for his appearance before the court concerned on all the dates of hearing.

The case of Vishambhar, who was arrested in connection with FIR No. 79/2008 for various offences under IPC and the Wild Life Protection Act, has been ongoing for some time. The petitioner had surrendered before the trial court on 15.04.2018 and has been behind bars since then. However, the court has now granted him bail, provided he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial Judge for his appearance before the court concerned on all the dates of hearing.

The decision to grant bail to Vishambhar was likely based on a number of factors. Firstly, the fact that he had surrendered himself to the trial court suggests that he was not a flight risk and was willing to cooperate with the legal process. Additionally, the length of time he had already spent in custody may have been taken into account, as well as any other mitigating circumstances that may have been presented to the court.

It is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that Vishambhar has been acquitted of the charges against him. Rather, it simply means that he will be released from custody while the legal process continues. He will still be required to appear before the court on all the dates of hearing, and failure to do so could result in the revocation of his bail and his return to custody.

Overall, the decision to grant bail to Vishambhar is a positive development for him, as it will allow him to be released from custody and continue with his life while the legal process continues. However, it is important to remember that he is still facing serious charges and will need to cooperate fully with the court in order to ensure a fair and just outcome.
