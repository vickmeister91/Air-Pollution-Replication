The Secretary of Paramekkavu Devaswom, a temple in Kerala, filed a writ petition against the Principle Chief Forest Conservator and Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests seeking permission to acquire a male elephant from outside the state of Kerala. The first respondent declined the request, citing Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which prohibits the transfer of any wild animal from one state to another without the prior permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state. 

The petitioner argued that there was no commercial transaction involved in the acquisition of the elephant and cited a previous court judgment in support of their argument. The court ruled that no permission was required from the first respondent to obtain the elephant from outside the state and set aside the first respondent's order.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court held that the section only applies to the transfer of wild animals for commercial purposes and not for religious or cultural purposes. The court also noted that the acquisition of the elephant was not a commercial transaction and that the temple had a long-standing tradition of using elephants in their religious ceremonies.

The court's decision was significant as it clarified the scope of Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The section has been a subject of controversy in the past, with some arguing that it is too broad and restricts the movement of animals for legitimate purposes. The court's interpretation of the section provides clarity on its scope and ensures that it is not misused to restrict the legitimate use of animals for religious or cultural purposes.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of balancing conservation efforts with the cultural and religious practices of communities. The use of elephants in religious ceremonies is a long-standing tradition in Kerala, and the court's decision ensures that this tradition can continue without undue restrictions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides clarity on the scope of Section 43 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and ensures that the legitimate use of animals for religious or cultural purposes is not unduly restricted. The decision also highlights the importance of balancing conservation efforts with the cultural and religious practices of communities.
