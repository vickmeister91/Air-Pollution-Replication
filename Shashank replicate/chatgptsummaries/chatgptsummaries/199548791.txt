The case at hand involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner, Vivek Chopra, under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner sought to quash the summons issued by the respondent police under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. The summons directed the petitioner to appear before the police based on a complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra, which the respondent police claimed was civil in nature.

During the proceedings, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent submitted that the enquiry had been closed and there was no need for the petitioner's appearance. The court took note of this submission and disposed of the Criminal Original Petition. The court also closed the connected miscellaneous petitions.

The petitioner's main contention was that the summons issued by the respondent police was illegal and without jurisdiction. The petitioner argued that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra was civil in nature and did not warrant the issuance of a summons under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner further contended that the respondent police had no authority to initiate an enquiry into a civil dispute.

The respondent police, on the other hand, argued that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra was not purely civil in nature and that there were allegations of criminal misconduct against the petitioner. The respondent police claimed that they had initiated an enquiry into the matter and had issued the summons to the petitioner in order to gather evidence.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, observed that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra did contain allegations of criminal misconduct against the petitioner. The court also noted that the respondent police had initiated an enquiry into the matter and had issued the summons to the petitioner in order to gather evidence.

However, the court also observed that the enquiry had been closed and that there was no need for the petitioner's appearance. In light of this, the court disposed of the Criminal Original Petition and closed the connected miscellaneous petitions.

In conclusion, the court upheld the legality of the summons issued by the respondent police under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. The court also noted that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra contained allegations of criminal misconduct against the petitioner. However, since the enquiry had been closed and there was no need for the petitioner's appearance, the court disposed of the Criminal Original Petition and closed the connected miscellaneous petitions.
