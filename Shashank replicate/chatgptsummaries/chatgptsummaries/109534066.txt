The court order in question pertains to a case where Smt. Kusum Devi, the petitioner, has filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.3, Udaipur, upholding an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class City (North) No.1, Udaipur in Criminal Regular case Nos. 159/2005, 162/2005, 160/2005, 163/2005, 161/2005, 164/2005.

The petitioner had moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for production of books of accounts to establish transactions that had allegedly taken place between the parties. The court has quashed the impugned order and allowed the petitioner to seek the documents pertaining to the transactions as per Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had approached the High Court under this section to challenge the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.3, Udaipur, upholding the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class City (North) No.1, Udaipur.

The petitioner had moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for production of books of accounts to establish transactions that had allegedly taken place between the parties. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to a person in possession of any document or thing to produce it before the court if it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The court, in its order, noted that the petitioner had sought the production of books of accounts to establish transactions that had allegedly taken place between the parties. The court observed that the documents sought by the petitioner were relevant to the case and were necessary for the purpose of establishing the truth. The court further noted that the documents sought by the petitioner were not privileged and were not covered by any legal protection.

The court, therefore, quashed the impugned order and allowed the petitioner to seek the documents pertaining to the transactions as per Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court also directed the respondent to produce the documents before the court within a specified time frame.

The court's order in this case is significant as it upholds the right of a petitioner to seek relevant documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court's order also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the truth is established in any legal proceeding and that relevant documents are made available to the parties concerned.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case is a welcome development as it upholds the right of a petitioner to seek relevant documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court's order also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the truth is established in any legal proceeding and that relevant documents are made available to the parties concerned.
