The court order pertains to a case where Ajay Kumar Pathak, also known as Lulu Pathak, was accused of running a crusher machine without permission from the Pollution Control Board and storing stones without a lease of a stone quarry. The case was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Mines and Minerals Act, and Jharkhand Minor Minerals Concessions Rules. 

The petitioner argued that the prosecution cannot be maintained for all the offenses except for the one under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner also claimed that no notice was given to him before lodging the case, and therefore, the order taking cognizance is bad. 

The court has listed the matter for further hearing and instructed the state to file a counter affidavit. This court order raises several important legal issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, the petitioner's argument that the prosecution cannot be maintained for all the offenses except for the one under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, raises the question of whether the other offenses are valid or not. The court will have to examine the evidence presented by the prosecution and determine whether the charges are justified or not. 

Secondly, the petitioner's claim that no notice was given to him before lodging the case raises the issue of procedural fairness. The court will have to determine whether the petitioner was given adequate notice and whether the order taking cognizance is valid or not. 

These issues are important because they relate to the fundamental principles of justice and fairness. The court must ensure that the petitioner's rights are protected and that justice is done. 

In addition, this court order highlights the importance of environmental protection. The petitioner was accused of running a crusher machine without permission from the Pollution Control Board and storing stones without a lease of a stone quarry. These activities can have a significant impact on the environment and can cause harm to the local community. 

Therefore, it is important that the court takes a strong stance on environmental protection and ensures that those who violate environmental laws are held accountable. This will send a message to others that environmental protection is a serious matter and that violations will not be tolerated. 

Overall, this court order raises important legal and environmental issues that need to be addressed. The court must ensure that justice is done and that environmental protection is taken seriously. The matter has been listed for further hearing, and it will be interesting to see how the court decides on these issues.
