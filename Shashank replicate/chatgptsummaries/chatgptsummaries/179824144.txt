The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Pramod Kumar, who sought a writ of mandamus commanding respondents not to interfere in the functioning of his brick kiln. The court stated that all brick kilns in the National Capital Region have been stopped pursuant to an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The court found no reason to interfere in the matter and suggested that the petitioner approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of his grievance.

The petitioner, Pramod Kumar, had filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus commanding respondents not to interfere in the functioning of his brick kiln. The petitioner argued that he had obtained all necessary permissions and licenses for the operation of his brick kiln and that the respondents had no authority to interfere in his business.

However, the court noted that all brick kilns in the National Capital Region have been stopped pursuant to an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The court observed that the order of the National Green Tribunal was binding on all authorities and that the respondents were duty-bound to comply with the same.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not approached the National Green Tribunal for redressal of his grievance. The court suggested that the petitioner approach the National Green Tribunal for appropriate relief.

The National Green Tribunal had passed an order in 2015 directing the closure of all brick kilns in the National Capital Region due to the high levels of pollution caused by them. The order was passed in response to a petition filed by an NGO, which had highlighted the adverse impact of brick kilns on air quality and public health.

The order of the National Green Tribunal was challenged by several brick kiln owners, who argued that they had obtained all necessary permissions and licenses for the operation of their brick kilns. However, the National Green Tribunal held that the permissions and licenses granted to the brick kiln owners were subject to the condition that they comply with the environmental norms and standards.

The National Green Tribunal also directed the state pollution control boards to ensure compliance with the environmental norms and standards by the brick kiln owners. The state pollution control boards were directed to conduct regular inspections of the brick kilns and take appropriate action against the violators.

The closure of brick kilns in the National Capital Region has had a significant impact on the brick industry and the livelihoods of the workers employed in the industry. The brick kiln owners have argued that the closure of their brick kilns has resulted in huge financial losses and that they are unable to repay their loans and meet their other financial obligations.

The closure of brick kilns has also led to a shortage of bricks in the market, which has resulted in an increase in the price of bricks. The increase in the price of bricks has had a cascading effect on the construction industry, which has been hit hard by the shortage of bricks.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court has dismissed a writ petition filed by Pramod Kumar seeking a writ of mandamus commanding respondents not to interfere in the functioning of his brick kiln. The court has suggested that the petitioner approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of his grievance. The closure of brick kilns in the National Capital Region has had a significant impact on the brick industry and the livelihoods of the workers employed in the industry.
