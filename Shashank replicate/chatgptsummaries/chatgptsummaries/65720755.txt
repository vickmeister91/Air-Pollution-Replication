Ramkailash Bhurtiya, who was accused of killing a leopard in the village of Badvahi, Chhattisgarh, has been granted bail by the court. The prosecution alleged that Bhurtiya and his co-accused placed poison on the meat of a cow that the leopard ate, leading to its death. Bhurtiya has been in jail since May 2018, but the court noted that there is no concrete evidence to establish the allegations against him. Furthermore, his co-accused has already been granted bail. Therefore, the court allowed Bhurtiya's bail application and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 with one surety of the same amount.

The case against Bhurtiya was based on circumstantial evidence, and the court found that there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime. The prosecution's case relied on the fact that Bhurtiya was present in the village at the time of the incident and that he had a motive to kill the leopard. However, the court found that these facts alone were not sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court also noted that Bhurtiya's co-accused had already been granted bail, which suggested that the evidence against Bhurtiya was weaker than that against his co-accused. The court found that there was no reason to treat Bhurtiya differently from his co-accused and that he should also be granted bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Bhurtiya is significant because it highlights the importance of concrete evidence in criminal cases. The court's decision suggests that circumstantial evidence alone is not sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the prosecution must present direct evidence that links the accused to the crime.

Furthermore, the court's decision to grant bail to Bhurtiya is also significant because it highlights the importance of equal treatment under the law. The court found that there was no reason to treat Bhurtiya differently from his co-accused, who had already been granted bail. This decision suggests that the court is committed to ensuring that all accused persons are treated fairly and equally under the law.
