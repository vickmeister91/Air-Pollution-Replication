In a case brought before the court, the petitioner sought a court order to direct the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to take action against officers who failed to perform their duties under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner also sought a direction to implement the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2001 and prohibit the use of moving chimney bull's trench kilns by brick manufacturers.

The court noted that the Board had started taking action against defaulters but had been lackadaisical in implementing the Act. The court directed the Board to take a decision on prosecuting units that violated the Act and issued notices on January 15, 2004. The court also noted that citizens could file complaints under Section 43(1)(b) of the Air Act if the Board failed to take action.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to prevent and control air pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. The Act also provides for the regulation of industries that emit pollutants into the air, and sets standards for the quality of air.

The Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2001 were introduced to strengthen the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Rules provide for the regulation of industries that generate hazardous waste, and set standards for the disposal of such waste. The Rules also provide for the regulation of industries that emit pollutants into the air, and set standards for the quality of air.
