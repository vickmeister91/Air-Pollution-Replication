The Madras High Court recently heard several petitions related to pollution complaints against Sterlite Industries Limited and India Cements Limited. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board filed two petitions against the State Human Rights Commission, seeking to quash enquiry proceedings related to pollution complaints against the two companies. The court found that the Commission had the power to hold an enquiry on complaints of human rights violations due to pollution or lack of safety measures. However, it should not entertain complaints against the Pollution Control Board, which is an appellate authority constituted under various Acts and Rules. The court also discussed the meaning and importance of human rights.

The court order discusses the history of human rights and the role of international charters in shaping Indian law. It also outlines the functions and powers of the National Human Rights Commission, which was created under the Protection of Human Rights Act of 1993 to investigate complaints of human rights violations and promote awareness of human rights. The order emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and cites a previous Supreme Court case that called for educational institutions to teach about environmental protection.

The court also discussed the duty of the Central Government to direct educational institutions to teach about protecting and improving the natural environment. It mentioned various laws and acts related to environmental protection, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Water (Prevention and Control) Act, 1974, and Air (Prevention and Control) Act, 1981. The order outlines the powers of entry and inspection, the procedure for taking samples, and the penalties for contravention of the provisions of the Act. It also discusses the liability of companies and the protection of action taken in good faith. Finally, it states that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of anything done in relation to the functions under this Act.

The court order discusses the relationship between the Protection of Human Rights Act and the Environment (Protection) Act. It concludes that the two acts operate in different areas and that the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act take precedence over any other law, except for the Protection of Human Rights Act in cases where an offense is punishable under both acts. The court also notes that the subject matter of the impugned notice issued by the Commission is pending before the court and therefore quashes the notice.

The court's decision highlights the importance of protecting human rights and the environment. It also emphasizes the need for educational institutions to teach about environmental protection and the duty of the Central Government to direct them to do so. The order outlines the powers and responsibilities of the Pollution Control Board and the National Human Rights Commission in addressing pollution complaints and human rights violations. It also discusses the various laws and acts related to environmental protection and the liability of companies for contravention of the provisions of the Act. The court's decision provides clarity on the relationship between the Protection of Human Rights Act and the Environment (Protection) Act and the precedence of the latter in cases of conflict. Overall, the court's decision is a step towards ensuring a cleaner and safer environment for all.
