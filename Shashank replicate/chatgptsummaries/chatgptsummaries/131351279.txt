The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association against the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and others. The petition seeks to quash a letter from the respondents and obtain injunctions and directions related to the slaughtering of sheep and goats by the members of the petitioner's association. The court heard arguments from both sides and separated the case from a related public interest litigation. The petitioner is an association of butchers and meat vendors, and the respondents include the municipal corporation and its commissioner. The court provides background information on the history of animal slaughter operations in Mumbai.

The court order discusses a petition filed by the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association regarding the licensing of slaughterhouses outside of the Deonar abattoir. The petitioners were eventually granted individual licenses to slaughter sheep and goats, but there were conditions set out in the communication. The court notes that there were some problems with waste disposal and waste, but the petitioners were being verified until June 1991. The court also mentions a communication issued by the Respondents on July 20, 1991, which granted permission for the removal of sheep and goats from the Deonar abattoir for a period of three months.

The court order pertains to the revocation of licenses granted to suburban licensees to remove sheep and goats from Deonar Abattoir to their respective shops. The permission was granted for three months only up to 3rd August 1991, and it was experimental. The court was challenged on the withdrawal of the letter of 20th July 1991. The court reviewed previous orders and directed the filing of further affidavits. The court also referred to the Slaughter House Rules of 2001 and the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888.

The court order discusses various sections of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act related to markets and slaughterhouses. It states that all markets and slaughterhouses maintained by the Corporation shall be called "municipal markets" or "municipal slaughterhouses", while all others shall be deemed private. The order also mentions the licensing requirements for selling or exposing animals for sale, opening new private markets, and using places as slaughterhouses. The Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation has the power to close municipal markets and slaughterhouses and dispose of the premises. The order also includes provisions for seizing animals or fish intended for human consumption found in the possession of those violating the licensing requirements.

The court order discusses various provisions related to the slaughter and sale of animals for human consumption, including regulations for private markets and slaughterhouses, licensing requirements for butchers, and prohibitions on selling animals outside of designated markets. The court has requested a comprehensive affidavit from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai regarding their compliance with these regulations and statutes. The deadline for the affidavit is November 2, 2018.

The court order requires an affidavit to be filed by the Municipal Commissioner or a high-ranking officer authorized by him, indicating the steps taken to establish a slaughterhouse in the area. The court also notes that the petitioner has brought attention to the neglect of maintenance and up-keep of slaughterhouses, licensing of private slaughterhouses, and prohibition of illegal slaughter and sale of animal beef. The court expects the state to ensure that rules and regulations are not violated, and multiple PILs on the same issue are not filed.

The court order discusses a case involving the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the MCGM. The court notes that there is nothing pending in the Supreme Court or in this court regarding the case. The court expects the State Government to guide and control all Municipal Corporations and Panchayats in the state to prevent pollution and ensure public health. The court also analyzes several affidavits filed on record, including one from the General Manager of Deonar abattoir denying the Petitioners' right to any license or permission to slaughter goats or sheep attached to their respective shops.

The court order recognizes the Deonar abattoir as the only authorized slaughterhouse under Section 61(h) of the MMC Act. The order references various legal cases and statutes, including the Food Safety and Standard Act 2006 and the Aircraft Act 1934. The court clarifies that the MCGM has not stopped the business of the Petitioner members but has changed the method of slaughtering in the interest of hygiene, civic sanitation, and public health. The court also notes that the continuance of the Petitioner's activity poses a danger to the public and to residents in the vicinity.

The court order discusses a case between the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the MCGM regarding the licensing and regulation of meat shops and slaughterhouses. The MCGM has implemented measures to prevent illegal slaughter and maintain hygiene in markets, including assigning inspectors to each municipal ward and directing license holders to dump waste only in MCGM trucks. The court also references a previous order that animals can only be slaughtered in recognized and licensed slaughterhouses. The MCGM argues that temporary experimental permissions for chamber slaughterhouses do not create legally enforceable rights.

The court order states that the temporary experimental permission for selling meat products created no legally enforceable right, and the non-extension of it does not violate any fundamental right. The petitioner and its members can obtain licenses to vend mutton and other meat products, and their source of livelihood is not curtailed. The court also explains various sections of the MMC Act
