The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Vineet Kumar Mathur regarding pollution in the river Gomti caused by various industries, including Mohan Meakins Breweries. The court ordered the State Pollution Board to inspect the effluent treatment plants of these industries and grant consent within a specified time frame. Mohan Meakins did not rectify the deficiencies in its effluent treatment plant by the given deadline and was not granted consent to operate. The company later applied for consent and was granted it, but failed to disclose this to the court. The court issued a notice to Mohan Meakins for not responding to requests for documents and adjourned the matter. Mohan Meakins later disclosed that it had been granted consent and the court issued a notice to the company.

The court issued contempt notices to the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Mohan Meakins for obtaining consent from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board to operate their plant in violation of the court's order. The court also issued a notice to the Member-Secretary of the Pollution Control Board for granting consent in violation of the court's order. The court directed the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. The court found that the consent granted to Mohan Meakins was in clear contravention of the court's order and that the Pollution Control Board and Mohan Meakins were parties to the order. The court concluded that the grant of consent was a violation of the court's order.

The court found that the grant of consent to Mohan Meakins was in clear violation of a previous court order. The addition of certain words to the consent order was seen as a clever ploy to cover up the violation. Both the Member-Secretary and Chairman of the Pollution Control Board were found guilty of violating the court order. The court considered whether to accept their unconditional apologies. The Member-Secretary claimed that he granted consent based on an amendment to Environment Rules and the power of review of the Pollution Control Board. The Chairman directed the Member-Secretary not to raise any objections to granting consent. The court noted that the note put up by the Member-Secretary and the orders passed by the Chairman did refer to the previous court order and the refusal of consent, but still granted consent subject to certain conditions. The court found that the industry could not operate without complying with those conditions and achieving the prescribed norms by December 31, 1993.

The court order states that two officers, Sri Pradeep Kumar and Sri Darshan Singh, violated the court's order dated January 15, 1993, by granting consent to Mohan Meakins to operate its plant and machinery without reference to the court. The court accepts their unconditional apology but warns them against any such violation in the future. The contempt petition is ordered accordingly, and orders against Brig. Kapil Mohan and Sri Yogesh Kumar will be passed later after hearing them on the fresh notice issued on October 12.
