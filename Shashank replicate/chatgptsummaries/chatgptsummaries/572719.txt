The court order in question pertains to a case between Rina Dyeing & Printing Works and Chowpaty Swimming Club. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had served a prohibitory order on Rina Dyeing & Printing Works for discharging trade effluent into municipal drains that did not meet prescribed norms. Despite the order, the unit continued to discharge effluent, and the GPCB requested the state government to take appropriate action against the unit.

The court directed the unit to pay 5% of the job work carried out by the unit from the date of the prohibitory order until March 1997, which amounted to Rs. 6,10,000. This was a significant penalty for the unit, and it was intended to serve as a deterrent to other units that might be tempted to flout environmental regulations. The court's decision was based on the fact that the unit had continued to discharge effluent despite being served with a prohibitory order, which showed a blatant disregard for the law.

In addition to the penalty, the unit was also permitted to dispose of 60,724 meters of cloth produced during trial production on the condition that it deposited 20 paise per meter within four weeks from the date of disposal of the goods and an undertaking to deposit the remaining 30 paise per meter as and when called upon by the court. This was a compromise that allowed the unit to dispose of the cloth it had produced during trial production, while also ensuring that it took responsibility for the environmental damage caused by its actions.

The court's decision was not just about penalizing the unit for its actions; it was also about sending a message to other units that might be tempted to flout environmental regulations. The court made it clear that it would not tolerate such behavior and that it would take strong action against any unit that violated environmental laws.

The court also directed that in the future, the unit would be permitted to clear goods processed during trial production on the same conditions. This was a significant concession, as it allowed the unit to continue its operations while also ensuring that it took responsibility for any environmental damage caused by its actions.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was a significant victory for environmental protection. It sent a clear message that environmental regulations must be taken seriously and that violators will be held accountable for their actions. The penalty imposed on the unit was significant, but it was necessary to ensure that other units did not follow in its footsteps. The compromise reached regarding the disposal of the cloth produced during trial production was a fair one, as it allowed the unit to continue its operations while also taking responsibility for its actions. The court's decision was a strong statement in favor of environmental protection, and it is likely to have a significant impact on other units in the region.
