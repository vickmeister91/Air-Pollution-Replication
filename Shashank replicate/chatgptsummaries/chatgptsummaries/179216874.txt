The court recently rejected an application made by Rajesh Tiwari under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Tiwari had requested the production of certain documents that were allegedly in the possession of a witness in a criminal case against him. Tiwari claimed that these documents were necessary for his defense, but the court ultimately found that they were not in the custody of the witness and had not been collected by Tiwari after his acquittal in a related case.

Tiwari's petition was based on the belief that the documents in question would help to exonerate him in the criminal case. However, the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the documents were actually in the possession of the witness. Furthermore, the court noted that Tiwari had not made any effort to collect the documents after his acquittal in the related case, which suggested that they may not have been as important to his defense as he claimed.

The court's decision was based on a careful review of the trial court's decision in the case. The trial court had also rejected Tiwari's request for the production of the documents, and the higher court found no error in this decision. The court noted that the trial court had considered all of the relevant factors in making its decision, including the relevance of the documents to the case and the potential harm that could result from their disclosure.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of careful consideration of all relevant factors when making decisions about the production of documents in criminal cases. While defendants have the right to access evidence that may be relevant to their defense, this right must be balanced against other important considerations, such as the privacy rights of witnesses and the potential harm that could result from the disclosure of sensitive information. In this case, the court found that Tiwari's request for the production of documents did not meet the necessary criteria, and therefore rejected his petition.
