The court order in the case of WLI vs Surender Singh Rathi was announced by the Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi on January 9, 2013. The case involved the recovery of alleged leopard skins from a scooter driven by the accused. The prosecution had charged Rathi with contravening section 49/49(b)(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, for possessing an uncured leopard skin without a license or authority. However, the court acquitted Rathi of the charge as the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

During the trial, the defense argued that the accused was falsely implicated and that there were material contradictions in the prosecution witnesses' statements. The defense also pointed out that the skins were not sent for testing, and the genuineness of the skins was doubtful. The accused claimed to be a journalist and was working on a story about wildlife animal skins. The court noted that the accused had provided evidence to support this claim.

The prosecution witnesses stated that the skins were genuine, but there were contradictions in their testimony. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused. The court also noted that the case property produced in court during evidence could not be linked to the recovered skins, as it was never sealed and identified.

The court ordered that the case property be confiscated to the state, and the file was consigned to the record room. The court's decision was based on the lack of evidence and the contradictions in the prosecution witnesses' statements. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charge.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of WLI vs Surender Singh Rathi highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt. The court found that the prosecution had failed to do so in this case, and therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charge. The court also noted the importance of properly sealing and identifying case property to ensure that it can be linked to the recovered items.
