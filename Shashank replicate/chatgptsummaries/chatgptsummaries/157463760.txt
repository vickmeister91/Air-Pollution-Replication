The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the Court of Special Metropolitan Magistrate (N.I. Act Cases), No.1, Jaipur Metropolitan, Jaipur in Criminal Case No.923/2015, titled as Satish Sharma Vs. Manoj Singh Chauhan. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. which was dismissed by the court. The complainant had alleged that he had paid Rs.1,65,00,000/- to the petitioner in cash, but during cross-examination, the complainant gave evasive and vague replies regarding the source of income. The petitioner's counsel submitted that the complainant could not divulge how he was in possession of such a huge amount of cash.

The court considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner's counsel and observed that the complainant had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the source of the cash. The court noted that the complainant had given evasive and vague replies during cross-examination, which raised doubts about the veracity of his claims. The court also noted that the petitioner had raised several objections to the complainant's claims, which had not been adequately addressed by the prosecution.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the order passed by the lower court and granted the petitioner the liberty to raise all arguments available to him before the trial court at the time of final arguments. The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties to a case be given a fair and equal opportunity to present their case before the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing a clear and satisfactory explanation regarding the source of funds in cases involving large sums of money. It also underscores the need for the prosecution to address all objections raised by the defense in a timely and effective manner. The court's decision to grant the petitioner the liberty to raise all arguments available to him before the trial court at the time of final arguments is a significant victory for the petitioner and underscores the importance of the right to a fair trial.
