The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Panchami Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit. The court found that the petitioner was a licensee with a valid license to run the unit and allowed the petition, quashing the closure notice and directing the respondents to permit operation of the unit at the present site till such time its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

In this case, M/S Panchami Stone Crusher had a valid license to operate a crushing unit in the State of Karnataka. However, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had issued a closure notice to the petitioner, citing violations of pollution control norms. The petitioner challenged this notice in a writ petition, seeking to quash it and direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the unit.

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the petitioner was indeed a licensee with a valid license to run the unit. The court also noted that the petitioner had submitted an application to the competent authority for renewal of its license, which was pending consideration. The court observed that the closure notice had been issued without considering the petitioner's application for renewal of license.

Based on these findings, the court allowed the petition and quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The court also directed the respondents to permit operation of the unit at the present site till such time its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

This court order is significant as it upholds the rights of a licensee to operate a unit in accordance with the terms of its license. It also emphasizes the importance of due process and the need for competent authorities to consider all relevant factors before taking any action against a licensee. The order provides relief to the petitioner and allows it to continue its operations while its application for renewal of license is pending consideration.
