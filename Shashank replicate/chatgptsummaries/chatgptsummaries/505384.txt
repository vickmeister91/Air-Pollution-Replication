In a writ petition filed by M/s. HR Gaviappa and Co. against the State of Karnataka and other respondents, the petitioner had been accused of illegal mining in a forest area based on a report by the Lokayukta. The petitioner argued that the report had not been accepted by the government and that they had not been given an opportunity to be heard. The court considered several questions, including whether the Lokayukta report could be the basis for the FIR and order of seizure, whether the FIR could be quashed, and whether the Forest Department had the power to take action against lease agreement violations.

The court ultimately held that the Lokayukta report and satellite maps could not be conclusive evidence against the petitioner and that the FIR could not be quashed at this stage. The court also ordered that the petitioner be given notice before any field inspection and that seized articles be returned to the petitioner subject to certain conditions. The court discussed the legality of prosecuting the petitioner based on a Lokayukta report and satellite maps that were not conclusive evidence against them. The court concluded that the report and maps can be used as a basis for initiating lawful action against those who have acted illegally. The court also stated that the power of judicial review should not be used to stifle a legitimate prosecution.

The court answered in the positive that it is proper for the court to exercise the power of judicial review to quash the FIR at a prima facie stage. The court also discussed the Forest Conservation Act and the restrictions it imposes on the use of forest land. The court concluded that the second respondent is empowered to seize the machinery, equipment, iron ore, and vehicles belonging to the petitioner for having committed an illegal mining operation in the forest area.

The court order stated that forest land can be leased to private individuals or organizations, but any non-forest activity in the area requires prior approval from the Central Government. The renewal of a lease also requires approval. The forest authorities have the power to take action against violations of lease conditions and seize equipment used for illegal activities. The order also directed an inspection of the leased area and allowed the petitioner to continue mining in undisputed areas. The court rejected the petition to quash the First Information Report and permitted the respondents to proceed in accordance with the law.
