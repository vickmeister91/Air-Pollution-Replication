The court has granted pre-arrest bail to Ataulla Ajmulla Khan in connection with a case registered with the Santacruz Police Station for alleged offences under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The applicant was falsely implicated in the case, and there was no destruction of mangroves on the survey site as alleged by the Talathi. The police intended to file a 'C' Summary Report in the case, indicating that there was no evidence to support the charges against the applicant.

The court considered the evidence presented by the applicant and found that there was no prima facie case against him. The court also noted that the applicant had cooperated with the investigation and had provided all necessary information to the police. The court therefore granted pre-arrest bail to the applicant on the condition of executing a PR bond of Rs.10,000 with one or two sureties in the same amount.

The case against the applicant was registered under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which deals with the destruction of mangroves. The Talathi had alleged that the applicant had destroyed mangroves on the survey site, but the court found no evidence to support this claim. The court also noted that the applicant had not been involved in any illegal activity and had not violated any environmental laws.

The court's decision to grant pre-arrest bail to the applicant is significant because it shows that the court is willing to consider the evidence presented by the accused and to grant bail if there is no prima facie case against them. This decision also highlights the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that those who violate environmental laws are held accountable.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant pre-arrest bail to Ataulla Ajmulla Khan in connection with the case registered with the Santacruz Police Station for alleged offences under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a positive development. The court's decision shows that it is willing to consider the evidence presented by the accused and to grant bail if there is no prima facie case against them. This decision also highlights the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that those who violate environmental laws are held accountable.
