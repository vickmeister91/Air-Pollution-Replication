The Gujarat Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the Indian state of Gujarat. Recently, a court order was issued in connection with a bail application filed by two individuals in connection with a case registered under this act. The first applicant withdrew the application, while the second applicant, who was a cleaner and had no criminal antecedents, was granted bail on certain conditions.

The court ordered the second applicant to execute a solvent surety of Rs.20,000 and to surrender his passport, if any, to the trial court within a week from the date of his release. This is a common condition for bail in India, as it ensures that the accused does not flee the country while the trial is ongoing. The court also directed the applicant to mark his presence before the concerned police station every Monday of every English calendar month for a period of twelve months. This is another common condition for bail, as it ensures that the accused does not abscond and remains available for trial.

In addition, the court ordered the applicant to file his undertaking before the court of his availability within a period of three days from the date of his release. This is a relatively uncommon condition for bail, but it is not unheard of. Essentially, it requires the accused to inform the court of his whereabouts at all times, so that the court can ensure that he is available for trial.

Finally, the court instructed the trial court not to be influenced by the observations made by the high court while granting bail. This is an important instruction, as it ensures that the trial court will make its decision based solely on the evidence presented before it, and not on any extraneous factors.

Overall, the court order is a standard one for bail in India, with a few relatively uncommon conditions. It is designed to ensure that the accused remains available for trial and does not abscond, while also protecting the interests of the state.
