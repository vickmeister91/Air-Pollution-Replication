The court order in question pertains to a case between Vadodara Enviro Channel Limited and the State of Gujarat. The respondent No. 2, GPCB, has objected to the maintainability of the petition on the grounds that an alternative remedy is available. The objection has been kept alive and will be considered after a reply is filed.

The case revolves around the issue of inflow and outflow of waste water from the Vadodara Enviro Channel Limited's plant. The petitioner has alleged that the GPCB has failed to take necessary action to prevent a situation where inflow is continuous but outflow is closed, leading to the accumulation of waste water in the plant.

The respondent No. 2, GPCB, has clarified that they will take necessary action to prevent such a situation. The court has granted time for the respondent No. 2 to file an affidavit in this regard.

It is important to note that the court has not passed any order that would restrain the GPCB from acting in accordance with orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court or learned Tribunal. This means that the GPCB is still bound by any previous orders passed by these higher authorities.

The case has been adjourned to 16th January 2019, by which time the respondent No. 2 is expected to file their affidavit. The objection raised by the respondent No. 2 regarding the maintainability of the petition will also be considered at this time.

Overall, the court order is a significant development in the ongoing case between Vadodara Enviro Channel Limited and the State of Gujarat. While the GPCB has clarified that they will take necessary action to prevent the accumulation of waste water in the plant, the court has not passed any order that would restrain the GPCB from acting in accordance with previous orders passed by higher authorities. The case has been adjourned to 16th January 2019, by which time the respondent No. 2 is expected to file their affidavit and the objection raised by them regarding the maintainability of the petition will also be considered.
