The court order pertains to various issues in the Vasant Kunj area of New Delhi, which have been brought to the court's attention through multiple writ petitions filed by residents. The petitions highlight the lack of basic amenities such as water, electricity, street lights, and proper roads in their colony. Additionally, the presence of JJ clusters and encroachment of a park by DJB has caused traffic problems in the area. The court has issued notices to concerned authorities and directed DDA and MCD to maintain a chart of encroachments and set targets for their removal.

The court has also ordered the appointment of a committee to oversee progress in this direction and sought clarification on the responsibility for road repairs. The Central Social Welfare Board, which has been allotted land in the area, is also seeking the removal of JJ clusters to gain possession of the land. The court has directed the DDA and MCD to comply with removing the encroachments and providing street lights and water supply to the area. The court has issued further directions for the Delhi Jal Board to provide details of measures to augment water supply and for a committee to inspect the area to verify claims regarding lighting and heavy goods vehicle traffic.

The court has also directed a committee to verify claims made by the traffic department regarding the prohibition of heavy and medium goods vehicles in a certain area. The court has ordered an inspection to be carried out within two days and for a report to be submitted before the next date. The court has given directions for deficiencies in lighting, traffic regulations, and sanitation to be addressed by various authorities. The committee inspects the site again and submits a report, and the court examines each problem in the light of the report and responses filed by the authorities. The issue of plying and parking of heavy and medium goods vehicles on a certain road is discussed, and the Delhi traffic police has issued a notification regarding this.

The court has prohibited the plying and parking of heavy and medium goods vehicles on Mahrauli-Mahipalapur road from 6 AM to 9 PM. The traffic police has taken steps to prosecute offenders who violate this order, but the court expects them to take stricter steps to ensure compliance. The court has also addressed the issue of inadequate lighting in the Vasant Kunj area and directed the DVB to take necessary steps for electrification. The court has also acknowledged the problem of unauthorized occupants and encroachments along the main Mehrauli-Mahipalapur road.

The court has addressed various issues in the Vasant Kunj area, including the conversion of open areas for parking and dumping of vehicles, misuse of agricultural land, removal of unauthorized JJ clusters, removal of demolished illegal constructions, and garbage disposal. The court has directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Traffic Police to take appropriate steps for removal of dumped vehicles and parking on open areas, and for the MCD to demolish structures where partial demolition has taken place and remove garbage and water-logging of waste water. The MCD is also directed to ensure that these areas do not become places for dumping of garbage in the future. The court warns that non-implementation of these directions may result in action against the erring officials.
