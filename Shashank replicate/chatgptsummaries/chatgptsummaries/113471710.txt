The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mani Ram against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame to prevent pollution of the canal.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories upstream and downstream of populated areas to determine the standard of water. The state is also directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal within a specified time frame. The court imposes a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to make citizens aware of this penalty through various media. The court also requests the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of a related case. The state is warned of a penalty if they fail to submit a long-term and short-term plan and an action report on the next date of hearing. The court directs the District Collector to be present on the next date of hearing. The state is directed to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The court imposes a penalty on the state for failing to comply with directions.

The court order directs the removal of all encroachments within one month and orders the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner of Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State Government is also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to remove existing structures causing contamination of canal water. The compliance report filed by the State Government is found to be lacking, and the court orders another opportunity for the State to file a response. Failure to comply with the court's directions may result in appropriate action.

The court order gives the Counsel for the State another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report. The court also orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal to provide information and records relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases related to environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order discusses a writ petition that alleges a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner seeks a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court. The court concludes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and that the writ court should be extremely slow in entertaining any issue which is under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The writ petition is dismissed, and the petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016.
