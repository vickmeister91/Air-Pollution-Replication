The Kerala High Court recently granted permission for the withdrawal of a writ appeal filed by Vijayan P.A., proprietor of Vijaya Industries, against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The appellant had sought to avail statutory remedies provided under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, including the revisional remedy provided before the government, against the orders impugned in the writ petition. However, the court recalled the judgment passed in the writ appeal on October 9, 2019, and dismissed the writ appeal as withdrawn by reserving liberty of the appellant to move before the statutory authorities against the orders impugned in the writ petition, to the extent it is sustainable under law.

The case involved allegations of pollution caused by the appellant's industrial unit, which was located in a residential area. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board had issued several orders directing the appellant to take measures to control pollution and to comply with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The appellant had challenged these orders before the High Court by way of a writ petition, which was dismissed by a single judge bench. The appellant had then filed a writ appeal against the order of the single judge bench.

During the hearing of the writ appeal, the appellant's counsel sought permission to withdraw the appeal and to avail the statutory remedies provided under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The counsel submitted that the appellant had already initiated proceedings before the government under the revisional remedy provided under the Act. The counsel further submitted that the appellant was willing to comply with the orders of the statutory authorities and to take measures to control pollution.

The court considered the submissions made by the appellant's counsel and observed that the appellant had a right to avail the statutory remedies provided under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also observed that the appellant had reserved the right to challenge the orders of the statutory authorities before the appropriate forum, if necessary. The court, therefore, granted permission for the withdrawal of the writ appeal and dismissed the same as withdrawn, reserving liberty of the appellant to move before the statutory authorities against the orders impugned in the writ petition, to the extent it is sustainable under law.

The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the importance of statutory remedies provided under environmental laws and encourages compliance with the orders of the statutory authorities. The decision also highlights the need for industrial units to take measures to control pollution and to comply with the provisions of environmental laws. The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on the environment and on the health and well-being of the residents living in the vicinity of industrial units.
