The Delhi High Court issued a judgment on March 10, 2017, in the case of M/S Sapphire Foods India Private Limited vs The Secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and others. The petitioner had challenged an order from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to close down their restaurant due to non-compliance with the Water Act and Air Act. The court found that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions to operate the restaurant and that there were deficiencies in their application for permission. The court rejected the petitioner's reliance on a previous case and allowed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to take action against the petitioner.

The court order discusses a case where a petitioner had set up a restaurant without prior permission and had not made necessary compliances under the Air and Water Act. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that time should be granted to rectify the situation before taking any action, citing the principle of sustainable development and the Polluter Pays principle. The court dismissed the petition and directed the concerned authority to disconnect the electricity and water supply to the petitioner. However, the dismissal of the petition would not prevent the petitioner from making an application for necessary permissions after complying with the law.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions to operate the restaurant and had not complied with the Air and Water Act. The court found that the petitioner had not made any effort to rectify the situation and had not shown any intention to comply with the law. The court also rejected the petitioner's reliance on a previous case, stating that the facts of the present case were different and that the previous case did not apply.

The court's decision was also based on the principle of sustainable development and the Polluter Pays principle. The court held that the petitioner had caused environmental damage by operating the restaurant without complying with the Air and Water Act and that the petitioner should bear the cost of remedying the damage. The court also held that the principle of sustainable development required that the environment be protected and that the petitioner's actions were in violation of this principle.

The court's decision to direct the concerned authority to disconnect the electricity and water supply to the petitioner was based on the fact that the petitioner had not complied with the law and had not shown any intention to comply with the law. The court held that this was necessary to ensure that the petitioner did not continue to cause environmental damage.

However, the court also held that the dismissal of the petition would not prevent the petitioner from making an application for necessary permissions after complying with the law. This was to ensure that the petitioner had an opportunity to rectify the situation and comply with the law.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's judgment in the case of M/S Sapphire Foods India Private Limited vs The Secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and others was based on the fact that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions to operate the restaurant and had not complied with the Air and Water Act. The court's decision was also based on the principle of sustainable development and the Polluter Pays principle. The court directed the concerned authority to disconnect the electricity and water supply to the petitioner but also held that the dismissal of the petition would not prevent the petitioner from making an application for necessary permissions after complying with the law.
