The court order pertains to a criminal revision filed by the accused-revisionist against an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lakhimpur Kheri. The order allowed a protest petition filed by the complainant against the final report submitted by the Investigating Officer in a case involving the smuggling of wild animal skins. The accused argued that the protest petition was not maintainable and that the order for re-investigation of the case was illegal as Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure only provides for further investigation. The court rejected the first argument and modified the order to reflect further investigation instead of re-investigation.

The court observed that the magistrate does not have the power to order for re-investigation of a case, but can only order for further investigation under Section 173 (8) of the Code. The order passed by the learned Magistrate for re-investigation of the case is modified to further investigation by the Investigating Officer. The court cited previous cases where the Hon'ble Apex Court and this court have held the same principle of law.

The court noted that the protest petition filed by the complainant was maintainable. The complainant had alleged that the Investigating Officer had not conducted a proper investigation and had not collected sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. The court observed that the complainant had a right to file a protest petition under Section 190(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further observed that the Magistrate had the power to take cognizance of the protest petition and order further investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code.

The court rejected the argument of the accused that the order for further investigation was illegal. The court observed that Section 173(8) of the Code provides for further investigation and empowers the Investigating Officer to collect further evidence. The court noted that the Investigating Officer had submitted a final report stating that there was no evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. However, the court observed that the Magistrate had the power to order further investigation if he was not satisfied with the final report.

The court also observed that the accused had not challenged the order of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the protest petition. The court noted that the accused had only challenged the order for re-investigation. The court observed that the accused could not challenge the order for further investigation as it was within the power of the Magistrate to order further investigation under Section 173(8) of the Code.

The court disposed of the criminal revision with the observation that the order for re-investigation was modified to further investigation. The court also observed that the protest petition filed by the complainant was maintainable and that the Magistrate had the power to order further investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code. The court further observed that the accused could not challenge the order for further investigation as it was within the power of the Magistrate to order further investigation under Section 173(8) of the Code.

In conclusion, the court order clarifies the powers of the Magistrate with respect to ordering further investigation in a criminal case. The court observed that the Magistrate does not have the power to order for re-investigation of a case, but can only order for further investigation under Section 173 (8) of the Code. The court also clarified that a protest petition filed by the complainant is maintainable and that the Magistrate has the power to order further investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code. The court's decision provides clarity on the legal principles involved in this case and sets a precedent for future cases involving similar issues.
