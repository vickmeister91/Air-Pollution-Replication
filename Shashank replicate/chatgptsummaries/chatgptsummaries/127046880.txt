The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently dismissed an appeal by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board challenging the validity of an order that quashed the denial of promotion to the post of Environmental Engineer for a diploma holder. The court found that the draft service rules were regulating the service conditions of the employees of the Board who had a clear intention to enforce the same in the near future. The court cited a Supreme Court decision in support of the respondent's entitlement to be considered for promotion.

The case involved a diploma holder who had been working as an Environmental Engineer with the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The Board had denied him promotion to the post of Senior Environmental Engineer on the grounds that he did not possess a degree in engineering. The respondent challenged this decision before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which quashed the denial of promotion and directed the Board to consider his case for promotion.

The Board then filed an appeal before the Punjab-Haryana High Court, challenging the validity of the CAT's order. The Board argued that the draft service rules, which required a degree in engineering for promotion to the post of Senior Environmental Engineer, had not been notified and were still in the process of being finalized. Therefore, the Board contended that the CAT's order was premature and should be set aside.

The High Court, however, rejected the Board's arguments and upheld the CAT's order. The court found that the draft service rules were regulating the service conditions of the employees of the Board who had a clear intention to enforce the same in the near future. The court observed that the Board had already started implementing the draft service rules by denying promotion to the respondent. Therefore, the court held that the CAT's order was not premature and that the respondent was entitled to be considered for promotion.

The court also cited a Supreme Court decision in support of the respondent's entitlement to be considered for promotion. In the case of State of Haryana v. Tilak Raj, the Supreme Court had held that a diploma holder who had been working as a Junior Engineer was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer, even though the service rules required a degree in engineering for such promotion. The Supreme Court had observed that the diploma holder had acquired sufficient experience and expertise in the field of engineering and was therefore entitled to be considered for promotion.

In light of the Supreme Court's decision, the High Court held that the respondent, who had been working as an Environmental Engineer for several years, had acquired sufficient experience and expertise in the field of environmental engineering and was therefore entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of Senior Environmental Engineer. The court directed the Board to consider the respondent's case for promotion in accordance with the CAT's order.

The High Court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that service rules cannot be used to deny promotion to deserving candidates who have acquired sufficient experience and expertise in their field of work. The decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that draft service rules are notified in a timely manner and that they are not used to deny legitimate rights of employees.
