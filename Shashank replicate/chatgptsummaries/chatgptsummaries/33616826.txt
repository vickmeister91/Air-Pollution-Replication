The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that challenged an order from December 2016, which stated that only the Forest Department could issue licenses to enter the Game Sanctuary under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner argued that this order was unfair and that the Tourism Department should also be allowed to issue licenses and allow entry into the sanctuary.

However, the court cited a previous case where it was held that the Tourism Department had no authority to issue licenses or allow entry into the sanctuary. The court found that the impugned order was in line with this previous ruling and that there were no grounds to interfere with it.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which clearly states that the Forest Department is responsible for the management and protection of wildlife in sanctuaries and national parks. The Tourism Department, on the other hand, is responsible for promoting tourism in the state.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the roles and responsibilities of different departments in managing wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. It also ensures that there is no confusion or overlap in the functions of different departments, which could lead to mismanagement and harm to wildlife.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards protecting wildlife and ensuring that sanctuaries and national parks are managed in a responsible and sustainable manner. It also highlights the importance of clear and well-defined laws and regulations in protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development.
