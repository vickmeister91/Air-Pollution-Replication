The Jharkhand High Court recently heard two writ petitions, one requesting a writ of mandamus to direct the Tate Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) to complete the dumping of slag by the side of the rivers, and the other requesting a writ of mandamus to the State Pollution Control Board to grant permission to TISCO for dumping of slag on the banks of river Kharkai. TISCO opposed the petitions, stating that they were private interest litigations and that the State Pollution Control Board had directed them to stop the dumping work. The court declined to issue any directions at this stage, as the issue was pending before the State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board. The petitions were dismissed.

The first writ petition was filed by a group of individuals who sought a writ of mandamus to direct TISCO to complete the dumping of slag by the side of the rivers. The petitioners argued that TISCO had been dumping slag by the side of the rivers for many years, and that the company had not completed the work as promised. The petitioners claimed that the incomplete dumping of slag was causing environmental damage and was a threat to public health.

The second writ petition was filed by TISCO, seeking a writ of mandamus to the State Pollution Control Board to grant permission for the dumping of slag on the banks of river Kharkai. TISCO argued that the dumping of slag was necessary for the smooth functioning of its operations, and that it had obtained all necessary clearances from the State Pollution Control Board. However, the State Pollution Control Board had directed TISCO to stop the dumping work, citing environmental concerns.

During the hearing, TISCO opposed both the petitions, stating that they were private interest litigations and that the State Pollution Control Board had already directed them to stop the dumping work. TISCO argued that the petitions were an attempt to interfere with its operations and that the company had taken all necessary steps to ensure that its operations did not cause any harm to the environment.

The court declined to issue any directions at this stage, as the issue was pending before the State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the State Pollution Control Board had already directed TISCO to stop the dumping work, and that the company had challenged the order before the Central Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the issue was a matter of public interest and that it was important to ensure that the environment was not harmed in any way.

The court also noted that the petitions were premature, as the issue was still pending before the State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board. The court observed that it was important to allow the statutory authorities to complete their proceedings before any directions could be issued by the court.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court declined to issue any directions at this stage, as the issue of dumping of slag by TISCO was pending before the State Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the issue was a matter of public interest and that it was important to ensure that the environment was not harmed in any way. The court dismissed both the writ petitions, stating that they were premature and that the statutory authorities should be allowed to complete their proceedings before any directions could be issued by the court.
