The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner had made an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC) to summon the Manager of State Bank of Mysuru and Muthoot Finance of Srinivasapura Branch to give evidence and produce jewels alleged to have been pledged by the accused. The trial court had rejected the application on the ground that the investigating officer had not recorded the statement of these witnesses nor seized those articles. However, the court has now allowed the application and directed the learned Sessions Judge to issue summons to the managers of the banks to give their evidence and produce the articles in question. The court has set aside the order passed by the trial court and allowed the application filed by the complainant under Section 91 of Cr.PC.

Section 91 of Cr.PC empowers a court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The provision is intended to enable the court to elicit the truth and to do justice between the parties. The section is wide enough to cover any document or thing that is relevant to the matter in issue, whether it is in the possession of the accused, the complainant, or any other person.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought the summoning of the Manager of State Bank of Mysuru and Muthoot Finance of Srinivasapura Branch to give evidence and produce jewels alleged to have been pledged by the accused. The trial court had rejected the application on the ground that the investigating officer had not recorded the statement of these witnesses nor seized those articles. However, the court has now allowed the application and directed the learned Sessions Judge to issue summons to the managers of the banks to give their evidence and produce the articles in question.

The court's decision to allow the application under Section 91 of Cr.PC is significant as it underscores the importance of eliciting the truth and doing justice between the parties. The court has recognized that the evidence sought to be produced by the petitioner is relevant to the matter in issue and that it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial. The court has also recognized that the investigating officer's failure to record the statement of the witnesses or seize the articles does not preclude the court from exercising its powers under Section 91 of Cr.PC.

The court's decision is also significant in that it underscores the importance of the role of the court in ensuring that justice is done. The court has recognized that the petitioner has a right to adduce evidence in support of his case and that the court has a duty to ensure that such evidence is produced. The court has also recognized that the trial court's decision to reject the application under Section 91 of Cr.PC was erroneous and that it had resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to allow the application under Section 91 of Cr.PC is a welcome development as it underscores the importance of eliciting the truth and doing justice between the parties. The court has recognized that the evidence sought to be produced by the petitioner is relevant to the matter in issue and that it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the trial. The court's decision also underscores the importance of the role of the court in ensuring that justice is done and that the rights of the parties are protected.
