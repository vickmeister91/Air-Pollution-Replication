However, the court dismissed the revision petition as it was not maintainable under Section 397 of Cr.P.C.

Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) deals with the powers of revision of the High Court or Sessions Judge. It states that the High Court or Sessions Judge may call for and examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior criminal court for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself as to the correctness, legality, or propriety of any finding, sentence, or order, and may, if necessary, pass any order thereon which it or he thinks fit.

This means that the High Court or Sessions Judge did not have the power to call for and examine the record of the proceeding in question.

The court's decision to dismiss the revision petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had not raised any substantial question of law or fact that required the court's intervention. The court noted that the petitioner had merely challenged the order passed by the lower court without providing any valid grounds for doing so.

The petitioner's counsel had requested the return of certified copies of the order, which was granted by the court. This means that the petitioner's counsel was given back the certified copies of the order that had been submitted to the court as part of the revision petition.
