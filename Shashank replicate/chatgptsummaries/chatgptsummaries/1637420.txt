The Bombay High Court heard two petitions challenging the legality of a pipeline set up by Indian Oil Tanking Limited (IDTL) to carry hazardous substance Naphtha from Virag to Navghar. The pipeline was alleged to have violated the provisions of the Central Government Notification dated 19th February 1991 governing the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and affected the mangroves in the area. The petitioners sought a declaration that the environmental clearance granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) was illegal and for the pipeline to be dismantled and removed. The court heard the case and disposed of it on 30th October 2002.

The court order discusses the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification and its amendments. The CRZ is classified into four categories, and certain activities are prohibited within the zone. The court considers a case where a pipeline is being laid in an ecologically sensitive area, and the petitioners argue that it violates the CRZ notification. The respondents argue that the pipeline is necessary for export purposes and falls under permissible activities. The court considers the language of the notification and the amendments and ultimately rules in favor of the respondents.

The court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a pipeline in a coastal regulation zone. The petitioner argued that the pipeline would harm the environment and fishing rights, while the respondent argued that it was necessary for economic development and had received necessary approvals. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondent, stating that the pipeline was a permitted activity and had been granted environmental clearance. The court also emphasized the need to balance environmental protection with economic development. The petitions and notice of motion were dismissed, with no order as to costs.
