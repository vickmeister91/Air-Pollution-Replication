The court order in question relates to a case between Prakash Solvex and Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity. The issue at hand is a notice that was issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The respondents' counsel has stated that this notice is going to be withdrawn.

The petitioners in this case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn with the liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation in India that seeks to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge. The Act aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use of its components, and ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources.

Section 7 of the Act deals with the procedure for obtaining prior approval of the National Biodiversity Authority before accessing biological resources for commercial or research purposes. The Act also provides for the establishment of State Biodiversity Boards to regulate access to biological resources at the state level.

In the case between Prakash Solvex and Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity, it appears that the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act has been withdrawn. It is not clear from the available information why this notice was issued in the first place, or why it is now being withdrawn.

The petitioners in this case have sought permission to withdraw their petitions with the liberty to file afresh if needed. This suggests that they may have some concerns about the legality or validity of the notice that was issued by the Biodiversity Board.

The court has allowed the petitioners' prayer and dismissed the petitions as withdrawn with the liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed. This means that the petitioners are free to pursue their case again in the future if they feel that their rights have been violated or if they have new evidence to present.

Overall, the court order in this case is relatively brief and does not provide much detail about the underlying issues. It is unclear why the notice was issued by the Biodiversity Board, why it is being withdrawn, and what the petitioners' concerns are. However, the order does suggest that the court is willing to grant the petitioners some flexibility in pursuing their case in the future if needed.
