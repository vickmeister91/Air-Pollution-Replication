In a recent court order, a defeated candidate filed an election petition against the winner who won by a margin of only 6 votes. The petition sought to declare the election of the winner as illegal and set it aside. The judge presiding over the case ordered the opening of sealed tendered votes and the election roll to properly adjudicate the matter.

However, the petitioner challenged this order, citing provisions of the Act and Rules. Despite this challenge, the court dismissed the petition and vacated the interim order. The court also rejected the petitioner's request to extend the interim relief.

The court's decision to open the sealed tendered votes and election roll is a significant step in properly adjudicating the matter. These documents will provide crucial evidence in determining the legality of the election and whether the winner truly won by a fair margin.

The petitioner's challenge to the court's order is understandable, as they likely believe that the Act and Rules do not allow for the opening of sealed tendered votes and the election roll. However, the court's decision to dismiss the petition and vacate the interim order suggests that they believe the evidence contained within these documents is necessary to properly adjudicate the matter.

It is important to note that the court's decision does not necessarily mean that the petitioner's claims are without merit. Rather, it simply means that the court believes that the evidence contained within the sealed tendered votes and election roll is necessary to make a fair and just decision.

The rejection of the petitioner's request to extend the interim relief is also significant. This means that the winner will remain in their position until the matter is fully adjudicated. It also suggests that the court believes that the petitioner's claims are not strong enough to warrant the removal of the winner from their position.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of proper adjudication in election disputes. The opening of sealed tendered votes and the election roll will provide crucial evidence in determining the legality of the election and whether the winner truly won by a fair margin. While the petitioner's challenge to the court's order is understandable, the court's decision to dismiss the petition and vacate the interim order suggests that they believe the evidence contained within these documents is necessary to make a fair and just decision.
