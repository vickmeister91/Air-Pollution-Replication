The court recently heard several writ petitions filed by M/S Chhatra Shakti Construction Co. regarding a contract awarded to them by the Public Works Department for widening and strengthening of Varanasi-Shakti Nagar road. The petitioner claimed that they were not handed over the free site for carrying out the entire work and that no objections could be given to them by the Forest Department, due to which they could not complete the work within the stipulated time. The court noted that the petitioner had completed a significant portion of the work and had been allowed to complete the work up to the date of completion, i.e., 23.1.2011. The court disposed of the writ petitions and suggested that the petitioner could invoke the arbitration clause in terms of the contract to assess compensation and loss.

In another court order, the court disposed of a writ petition and referred to clauses 24 and 25 of the contract for dispute resolution. The petitioner had raised grievances about not receiving a no objection certificate from the Forest Department and not being granted an extension of the contract period. The State had handed over the road to the U.P. State Highways Authority for maintenance and repair, and the petitioner was allowed to complete their work until the last date of completion. The court notes that the petitioner can claim payment for work done and that the State has decided to return the surety money deposited by the petitioner without any penalty. The court cites various judgments to explain the circumstances under which writ jurisdiction can be exercised despite the availability of alternative remedies.

The court order also discussed several cases that were relied upon by the petitioner's counsel. One case involved a contract where the government was not empowered to adjudicate upon disputed questions of breach and damages arising from the breach. Another case involved the grant of a mining lease and the subsequent decision to hold an auction of the mining rights. The court allowed the appeal and upheld the order of the Collector. The third case laid down principles for interference by the High Court in contractual matters. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petitions and advised the petitioner to raise any disputes in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
