The Rajasthan High Court has received multiple writ petitions in the public interest regarding the Jal Mahal Tourism Project and the Mansagar Lake Precinct Lease Agreement. The petitions requested the cancellation of the project and the lease agreement, the removal of sedimentation and settling tanks from the Mansagar Lake basin, the restoration of Nagtalai and Brahampuri Nalah to their original position, and the monitoring and maintenance of the Mansagar Lake. The court was also asked to impose a compensatory fine for damage to the Mansagar Lake area and environment. The petitions claimed that the project was not environmentally assessed and that the lake was converted into a series of small tanks, affecting its aesthetic value and altering its flora and fauna.

One of the cases involved a private entrepreneur who was granted a lease for 100 acres of land in the bed of Mansagar Lake in Jaipur for a tourism project. The petitioner alleged that the project had caused an increase in salinity levels in the lake, which would harm the flora and fauna. The petitioner also alleged that the project was carried out without requisite sanctions and clearances, and that it violated various laws and rules. The petitioner further alleged that the project was a case of siphoning of valuable public property, and that it was against public interest. The court was asked to declare the project illegal and void.

In another case, the court discussed a dispute over the leasing of land for the Jal Mahal Tourism Project in Jaipur. The court found that the lease agreement was not beneficial to the lessor and that the construction of a hotel in the area was not permissible. The court also noted that the revised plan for the project was bad in law and that the area in question could not have been leased out to a private person due to the presence of Dargah and temples. The court considered the stand of the state and authorities, as well as the Jaipur Development Authority, and the reply of the lessee. The lessee argued that the project was in the public interest and that the decision to lease the land to them was made by an expert body. The lessee also argued that they had invested a significant amount of money in the restoration of the area and that they had not caused any environmental damage.

The court order also pertained to the restoration of the Jal Mahal monument situated in the Mansagar Lake in Jaipur. The Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. had been granted a 99-year lease for 100 acres of land surrounding the monument for commercial activities. The petitioners challenged the lease agreement, claiming that it was illegal and violated environmental laws. The Ministry of Environment and Forests clarified that it had only sanctioned the project for conservation and management of Mansagar lake in Jaipur and not the Jal Mahal Tourism Project. The court dismissed the petitions and allowed the project to proceed.

The court also discussed the public trust doctrine, which states that the state is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment, and has a legal duty to protect them. The doctrine includes the responsibility to protect the environment and ecosystems, and prohibits the conversion of public resources into private ownership or commercial use. The court emphasized the importance of sustainable development and inter-generational equity in protecting natural resources. The order cited several cases where the doctrine was applied to protect communal property, such as historical tanks and village ponds, from being converted into private ownership or commercial use.

The court order stated that land recorded as a village pond should not be allotted to anyone for construction purposes. The court ordered the respondents to vacate the land they had illegally occupied and noted that many ponds in the country had been filled with earth and built upon, contributing to water shortages. The court also stated that government orders permitting allotment of gram sabha land to private persons and commercial enterprises on payment of money were illegal. The court emphasized the need to protect the environment and safeguard natural resources, and ordered a ban on conversion and construction permission in and around lakes and their respective catchment areas. The court declared the lease deed for the lake bed area illegal and void and criticized the State and its functionaries for violating the principles enshrined in the Constitution.

In another case, the court found that the project in question violated Rule 4 of the Wetlands Rules and was illegal and unauthorized. The court also found that the lease of the land to Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. for a period of 99 years at a throwaway price was fraudulent and a siphoning of valuable public property. The court ordered that the project could not be given effect to and that the land should be leased out at the actual cost of the land and annual premium as provided under the Rules of 1974 and 1997.

The court order declared the lease agreement for 100 acres of land on Mansagar Lake to Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. as illegal and void due to violations of Wetlands Rules, 2010 and Ramsar Convention. The agreement allowed the lessee to charge entry fees and user charges on the public, which was deemed arbitrary and in violation of transparency and public trust doctrine. The court ordered the removal of sedimentation and settling tanks, restoration of the lake's original position, and dismantling of the wall erected by the lessee. All encroachments in the catchment area of the lake were to be removed, and the boundaries of the lake were to be maintained in consultation with the Central Government MOEF. The court found the PIL
