The National Green Tribunal heard a case brought by Himanshu R. Barot against the State of Gujarat and Anil Products Limited, a private company that manufactures glucose, medicines, biscuits, and other products using starch derived from maize. Barot alleged that Anil Products did not follow safety measures and environmental laws in the manufacturing process, causing air and water pollution and health hazards to residents in the area. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Environment Department of the State of Gujarat were also named as respondents for their failure to enforce environmental laws. Anil Products denied the allegations and claimed that appropriate safety measures were taken to prevent pollution. The case was heard on April 22, 2014.

The court order states that Anil Products, a factory, has taken safety measures to prevent pollution outside its premises and has complied with pollution laws. However, there were complaints of foul smell and pollution caused by the factory, and an incident of explosion occurred in 2003. The court ordered a study to verify compliance with pollution standards and to determine necessary control measures. The report found that emissions from the factory did not meet specific standards, and the factory had not been following norms to prevent air pollution. The court will further examine the alleged violations of pollution laws by Anil Products.

The court order discusses various faults found in the operation of Anil Products, including deficiencies in the coal storage yard, poor maintenance of hazardous waste storage, and foul smells in the factory premises. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) gave notices to Anil Products to rectify these issues, but the company failed to comply with environmental norms. Despite this, the GPCB granted Anil Products consent to operate after the company submitted an undertaking to carry out improvements. However, the court found that Anil Products continued to generate air pollution and failed to properly monitor hazardous waste discharge. The court relied on a report from the Civil Engineering Department of M.S. University, Baroda, which recommended measures to control fugitive emissions and manage boiler fly ash. The report also recommended maintaining logbooks for wastewater flow, gas flow, chemical consumption, fuel consumption, and solid/hazardous waste generation to monitor treatment systems.

The court order requires Anil Products to provide a proper storm water collection and disposal system, prevent mixing of raw material and hazardous waste with storm water, and provide personal protective equipment to workers. The court found that Anil Products generates dust and odour pollution, and ordered them to pay a compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- for the pollution caused. The court also approved the recommendations of the Civil Engineering Department of Baroda University and directed Anil Products to comply with them within nine months under the supervision of G.P.C.B. Failure to comply may result in closure of the factory. Anil Products must also pay costs of Rs. 25,000/- to the applicants.
