Bedi, along with three others, were charged with offenses under sections 384, 341, 506, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The complaint was filed by Atul Aggarwal, who alleged that the accused demanded illegal entry fees from him and harassed him when he refused to pay. However, the judgment delivered on October 31, 2015, acquitted the accused of all charges. The court order provides a summary of the facts of the case and the final verdict.

In the second case, the court order describes a case where Mr. Khurana and his associates threatened the complainant and demanded Rs. 60,000 from him. The complainant gave them a cheque of Rs. 20,000 and a post-dated cheque of Rs. 40,000 to save himself and his family. After an investigation, a charge sheet was filed against the accused under various sections of the IPC. The prosecution examined several witnesses, and the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The accused were granted anticipatory bail and were released on police bail. The court allowed the complainant's applications under Section 91 and 311 Cr.P.C. and recorded the statements of witnesses. The accused denied the allegations and claimed that the demand made by the society was legal and in accordance with the law.

The third court order pertains to a criminal case where the accused are members of a cooperative housing society. The accused are alleged to have made illegal demands and threatened the complainant. The accused deny the allegations and state that the demands were legal and in compliance with the society's resolutions. They also state that the complainant fabricated the incident and filed a false case against them. The accused argue that they were falsely implicated and deserve to be acquitted. The court records the statements of the accused and their witnesses in defense evidence.

In the fourth case, the court heard final arguments and examined witnesses in the case against accused P.J.B. Khurana and P.N. Sharma. The prosecution presented evidence of the accused threatening the complainant and disconnecting his water supply. The defense presented witnesses to refute the prosecution's claims. The court reviewed the evidence and witness testimonies before making a decision. The complainant testified to the accused demanding Rs. 60,000 and threatening him with physical harm. The court also reviewed documents related to the case, including a letter from a retired government officer instructing the society not to collect certain fees.

The fifth court order discusses the evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense in a case related to a cooperative society. The court finds that the testimony of some of the prosecution witnesses is not credible and that the prosecution has not been able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also notes discrepancies in the testimony of some witnesses and the lack of proof for certain documents. Ultimately, the court concludes that the prosecution has failed to prove its case and acquits the accused.

In the final court order, the complainant alleged that he was threatened by members of a cooperative society. However, the court found several inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony and evidence, including the lack of proof of a threatening phone call and the complainant's contradictory actions in withdrawing a civil suit against the society. The court ultimately found the complainant's version of events to be unreliable and dismissed the case.

In all of these cases, the court carefully reviewed the evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense before making a decision. In some cases, the court found that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, while in others, the court found inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony and evidence. Ultimately, the court's decisions were based on a thorough examination of the facts and evidence presented in each case.
