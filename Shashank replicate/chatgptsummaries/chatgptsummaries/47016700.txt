The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The first text provides no further information, while the second text lists the names of the petitioners and respondents, along with the petition numbers and the names of the lawyers representing them.

The third court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the deposit of Net Present Value (NPV) for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The controversy involves 136 mining leases in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan. The mining department was required to deposit one-time compensation charges with the Forest Department in lieu of deforestation and bear the cost of afforestation. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015, requiring the realization of NPV from the user agency, i.e., the Mining Department, within two years from the date of notification. The petitioner and 63 other mining lease holders deposited a sum of Rs.8,79,53,196/- on a pro-rata basis at the rate of Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare on 25.10.2017 under protest. The court heard all the writ petitions together and decided on a common judgment.

The fourth court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

The fifth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The sixth court order pertains to a dispute between 136 mining lease holders and the government over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land diversion. The mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of 281 hectares of forest land, which was approved in 2000. However, 62 mining leases were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed, and the mining lease holders refused to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including their share in the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the 62 mining leases that were cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish these leases to the Forest Department.

In summary, the court orders relate to various civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves 136 mining leases in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan, and the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes.
