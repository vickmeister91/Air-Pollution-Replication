In a recent case, the petitioner approached the court seeking relief through a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner requested the quashment of an advertisement and the allotment of kiosks to respondents No. 6 and 7. The respondents argued that the area in question was part of a protected forest area and that no commercial activities were permitted.

The court examined the arguments put forth by both parties and ultimately refrained from examining the petitioner's right to relief. Instead, the court directed the petitioner to pursue a civil suit. This decision was based on the fact that the issue at hand was a disputed question of fact that required a detailed examination of evidence. The court held that such an examination was not possible in a writ petition and that the petitioner should pursue a civil suit to establish their rights.

The court's decision was based on the principle that writ jurisdiction should not be used to decide disputed questions of fact. Writ jurisdiction is a summary remedy that is meant to be used in cases where there is a clear violation of a legal right. In cases where there is a dispute over facts, the court held that it was more appropriate for the parties to pursue their remedies through a civil suit.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the principle of separation of powers. The court recognized that it was not its role to decide disputed questions of fact and that such decisions should be left to the appropriate forum. This decision also highlights the importance of pursuing the appropriate legal remedy in order to establish one's rights.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of pursuing the appropriate legal remedy in order to establish one's rights. The court recognized that writ jurisdiction should not be used to decide disputed questions of fact and that such decisions should be left to the appropriate forum. This decision reaffirms the importance of the principle of separation of powers and underscores the need for parties to pursue their remedies through the appropriate legal channels.
