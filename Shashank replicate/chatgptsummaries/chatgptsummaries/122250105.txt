The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases of termination or dismissal from service. In the first case, a workman filed a case against his employer, M/s. Lancer Convent Senior Secondary School, claiming that he was illegally dismissed from service due to his demands for legal facilities that were not being provided by the management. The management, on the other hand, claimed that the workman was dismissed after a fair and proper domestic enquiry was conducted against him for charges of rash and negligent driving. The court framed issues related to the termination and the fairness of the enquiry, and after hearing arguments and examining evidence, it was held that the enquiry was conducted fairly and according to the principles of natural justice. The court did not find the termination to be illegal or unjustified.

In the second case, a school bus driver was terminated from his services after being charged with rash and negligent driving and causing an accident. The management conducted a fair domestic enquiry, which found him guilty of misconduct, and terminated his services. The claimant argued that his termination was illegal and unjustified, citing his acquittal by the court and the fact that other drivers who committed similar offenses were not terminated. However, the court found that the claimant was convicted of the offense and that the management had followed the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court and the Delhi Government, which prohibit drivers with a history of traffic offenses from driving school buses. The court also found that the management had violated Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act by terminating the claimant's services while a general demand case was pending.

The third case pertains to the termination of an employee that was found to be in violation of Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The court held that the conditions contained in the proviso to Section 33(2)(b) are mandatory and must be complied with, and any employer who contravenes the provisions of Section 33 invites punishment. The court also stated that the relief of reinstatement is not automatic and depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, and compensation in lieu of reinstatement or back wages may be appropriate. The order cites various judgments to support these conclusions.

The fourth and final case discussed in this summary states that the illegality of dismissal/termination from service of a workman does not necessarily result in his reinstatement. In cases where reinstatement may not be appropriate, compensation in lieu of reinstatement may be awarded. The court cites previous cases where compensation was deemed appropriate instead of reinstatement. In this specific case, the claimant violated guidelines and cannot be reinstated as a school bus driver. However, he was terminated illegally, and therefore, compensation of Rs.150,000 is awarded to him. The management is directed to pay the amount within 30 days, and if they fail to do so, they will be liable to pay interest at 8%. The court order is to be published and sent to the Secretary Labour, Govt. of NCT, Delhi.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of conducting fair and proper domestic enquiries before terminating an employee's services. They also emphasize the mandatory nature of the conditions contained in the proviso to Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act and the consequences of violating them. Additionally, they establish that the relief of reinstatement is not automatic and depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, and compensation in lieu of reinstatement or back wages may be appropriate.
