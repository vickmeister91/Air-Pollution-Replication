In a recent court order, Devi Lal and Anil were granted bail after being charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for their involvement in the killing of a Neel Gai. The two applicants had been in custody for over three and a half months, and their counsel argued that the offence was triable by a Judicial Magistrate First Class. The court ultimately allowed the bail application and ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.25,000 each with one solvent surety in the same amount for their appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act was enacted in 1972 with the aim of protecting wild animals and plants, and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and its derivatives. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and prohibits hunting, trapping, and trade in wildlife and its derivatives. The Act also provides for penalties for offences related to wildlife, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Devi Lal and Anil were charged under the Act for their involvement in the killing of a Neel Gai, which is a type of antelope found in India. The offence is considered serious, as the Neel Gai is a protected species under the Act. The two applicants had been in custody for over three and a half months, which is a significant amount of time. Their counsel argued that the offence was triable by a Judicial Magistrate First Class, which is a lower court than the one in which they were being held. This argument was likely made in an attempt to secure bail for the applicants.

The court ultimately allowed the bail application and ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs.25,000 each with one solvent surety in the same amount for their appearance in the trial court on the dates fixed by that court during the trial. This means that the applicants were required to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that they would appear in court on the dates fixed by the trial court. The surety, or guarantor, was also required to provide a similar sum of money as a guarantee. This is a common requirement in bail applications, as it helps to ensure that the accused will appear in court as required.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act in protecting India's wildlife. The Act provides for strict penalties for offences related to wildlife, and the court's decision to grant bail in this case shows that the Act is taken seriously by the judiciary. The court's decision to order the applicants to furnish a personal bond and a surety also shows that the judiciary takes the issue of bail seriously, and that it is willing to impose conditions on bail applications to ensure that the accused appear in court as required.
