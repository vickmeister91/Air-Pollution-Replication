The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching industries in Tirupur, which has affected the Noyyal river and its surrounding areas. The Noyyal River Ayacutdars Protection Association filed a Public Interest Litigation seeking to prevent pollution of the Noyyal river in Tamil Nadu caused by dyeing and bleaching works at Tirupur area. The court considered the arguments of both parties, including the importance of the industry for the local economy and the need to protect the environment and compensate those affected by the pollution.

The court issued directions to the dyeing and bleaching units to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) of trade effluents and imposed a fine on them for non-compliance. The court also directed the respondents to deposit a sum of money towards cleaning and desilting operations of the Orathapalayam dam and compensation for loss caused by pollution. The court upholds the "polluter-pays" principle and the duty of the state to protect and preserve the environment.

The court order requires industries to implement clean production measures, monitor reverse osmosis plants, and inspect industries and report progress to the court. The court also constituted expert committees and monitoring committees to oversee the implementation of these measures. The court orders the members of the appellant Association to comply with all directions, pay dues, and ensure no pollution is caused to the river or dam within three months. The court also holds the members responsible for meeting expenses to reverse the ecology and compensate affected families.

The appellant filed a review petition, which was dismissed. The appellant argued that the fine imposed was unjustifiable and that they were willing to prevent pollution. They also argued that the dyeing and bleaching industry provided employment to a large number of people. However, the court found that the industry must take responsibility for its actions and ensure that it does not harm the environment or the people living in the surrounding areas.

The court order stayed the closure of units of an appellant association until July 31, 2007, and extended the interim order from time to time. The association has not fully complied with the High Court's orders, and the court has given them three months to ensure compliance, including making CETPs functional, paying the balance amount for cleaning the dam and river, and compensating affected persons. The Pollution Control Board is directed to ensure no pollution is caused. The appeals have been disposed of accordingly.

In conclusion, the court order in the case involving pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching industries in Tirupur is a significant step towards protecting the environment and compensating those affected by the pollution. The court has imposed fines on the industry and ordered them to take measures to prevent further pollution and clean up the affected areas. The court has also constituted expert committees and monitoring committees to oversee the implementation of these measures. The court upholds the "polluter-pays" principle and the duty of the state to protect and preserve the environment. The court order requires industries to implement clean production measures, monitor reverse osmosis plants, and inspect industries and report progress to the court.
