The case in question involves a dispute between employees of a cement factory who were transferred from one factory to another and lost certain benefits in the process. The employees filed suits seeking a declaration of their entitlement to seniority and other benefits, but the defendant argued that the suits were not maintainable in a civil court and that the employees had already waived their seniority rights.

Initially, the trial court dismissed the suits, but the appellate court held that the civil court had jurisdiction to hear the case and remanded the suits for fresh disposal. However, the court ultimately found that the dispute was an industrial dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to file the suits in civil court. The appeals were allowed, and the suits were dismissed.
