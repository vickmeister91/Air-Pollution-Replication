The Bombay High Court recently heard and decided four petitions challenging an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, 62nd Court, Dadar, Mumbai, issuing process under various sections of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, 2000. The petitions were disposed of by a common order. The complainant alleged that the construction of the Bandra Worli Sea Link Project led to an abnormal increase in vehicular traffic in Worli Sea Face area, causing air and noise pollution beyond the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The complainant relied on studies conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and noise monitoring conducted by the accused.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed against several parties for violating noise and air pollution regulations in BSWL. The complainant relied on studies conducted by NEERI and noise monitoring conducted by one of the accused parties. The court found that the accused parties had not complied with an order passed by the NGT and had violated relevant sections of the Environment Protection Rules and Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules. The court issued process against accused parties 1-5, 10-15, 19-22 for the offense punishable under various sections and rules. The accused parties filed writ petitions challenging the order.

The court order discusses arguments made by both the defense and the complainant in a case related to noise and air pollution. The defense argues that no offense has been committed and that the National Green Tribunal's order cannot be implemented by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. They also argue that the notice given is deficient and that the complaint should have been filed with the National Green Tribunal. The complainant argues that the accused have not complied with the National Green Tribunal's directions and that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued directions to check pollution levels. The court considers both arguments and makes a decision based on the evidence presented.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has directed the Traffic Commissioner to check the pollution levels of vehicles on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link for compliance with BS-IV standards. The complainant alleges that the Traffic Department has not taken suitable measures to control pollution after collecting data on noise pollution. The accused have failed to comply with relevant provisions of Environment Protection Rules and Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, as well as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has issued process based on the complaint. The complainant has given notice of the alleged offence and his intention to make a complaint to the Central Government or authority or officer authorized.

The court order discusses the sections of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and relevant rules that pertain to the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution. The accused, who are officers, are not involved in any manufacturing, industry, or operation and therefore, sections 7 and 8 of the Act cannot be applied to them. Section 9 requires a person in charge to intimate the fact of pollution and render assistance to authorities and agencies, while section 10 gives power of entry and inspection to collect data of pollution and prevent it. Section 15 provides for penalties for contravention of the Act and rules, while section 16 pertains to offences by companies and section 17 pertains to offences by government departments. The accused are not companies or directors/officers of any company, and section 17 can only be applied if the offence was committed due to negligence or connivance of any officer.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Environment Protection Act and Rules, as well as the Noise Pollution Regulation and Control Rules. It clarifies that certain sections and rules do not apply to the issue of heavy vehicular traffic, which is not considered an industry, process, or operation. The complaint filed against various individuals and entities alleges failure to comply with environmental regulations and obligations. The court considers the specific allegations and drops certain accused parties from the case.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal in penalizing those who violate environmental laws. The court notes that while the Tribunal has the power to impose penalties for non-compliance with its orders, it cannot try or punish accused persons found guilty under the Environmental Protection Act. The court also refers to an order by the National Green Tribunal directing the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to prescribe noise standards for the use of sirens and multi-toned horns, and notes that the Tribunal has the power to hold authorities in contempt and prosecute them for non-compliance with its orders.

The court order discusses the use of inherent powers by the High Court to quash and set aside criminal proceedings. The court cites various judgments to establish the criteria for issuing process and the need for the magistrate to consider the complaint and other documents relied upon by the complainant. The court also notes that the High Court has supervisory powers to stop the abuse of powers and unnecessary criminal litigations when no specific offense is made out. The court examines the allegations made against the Nevatia group and finds them to be vague and unsupported by evidence. The court notes that the authorities have taken steps to comply with the orders of the National Green Tribunal and that if there is pollution, it should be controlled.

The court order states that documents and communication are part of the complaint regarding air and noise pollution. The accused parties have taken steps to comply
