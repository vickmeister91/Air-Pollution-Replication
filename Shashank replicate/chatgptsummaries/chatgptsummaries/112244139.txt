The court orders discussed in this text pertain to various cases involving the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and individuals accused of disproportionate assets and irregularities in the Taj Heritage Corridor project. 

In the first case, politician Mayawati filed a writ petition questioning the scope of an FIR lodged against her under the Prevention of Corruption Act. She argued that the FIR was beyond the scope of the court's previous orders and that the CBI had acted with mala fide intentions without obtaining necessary consent from the state government. The court held that the FIR was not beyond the scope of its previous orders but also found that the CBI had acted without jurisdiction. The investigation into Mayawati's assets was deemed illegal.

The second case involved a petitioner seeking to quash a second FIR against her, claiming that there was no direction by the court to empower the CBI to lodge two FIRs. The court heard arguments from both sides and mentioned earlier orders directing the CBI to investigate any illegality/irregularity committed by officers/persons involved in the Taj Heritage Corridor project.

In the third case, the court directed the CBI to interrogate and verify the assets of individuals involved in the Taj Heritage Corridor project due to allegations of Rs. 17 crores being released without proper sanction. The court also directed the government to hold departmental inquiries against certain individuals and for the CBI to lodge an FIR and make further investigation against officers and persons involved in the matter. The court clarified that the order was confined only to the Taj Corridor matter and did not include any direction to lodge an FIR against the petitioner for alleged disproportionate assets. The court also noted that the second FIR against the petitioner was not sustainable as no consent was obtained from the government of the state.

In the fourth case, the court discussed the legality of an FIR filed by the CBI against the petitioner in connection with the Taj Corridor matter. The court concluded that the CBI exceeded its jurisdiction in lodging the FIR without any specific direction from the court and any investigation pursuant to it was illegal and liable to be quashed. The court also allowed an intervention application filed by Kamlesh Verma, who was pursuing a writ petition against the petitioner in the High Court.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary consent when conducting investigations and lodging FIRs. The court also emphasized the need to confine orders to specific matters and not exceed jurisdiction.
