The Rajasthan High Court received multiple writ petitions in the public interest regarding the Jal Mahal Tourism Project and the Mansagar Lake Precinct Lease Agreement. The petitions requested the cancellation of the project, the removal of encroachments made in the catchment area of Mansagar Lake, the cessation of sewage discharge into the lake, and the allowance of people to visit their religious places without obstruction. The court found that the project was not environmentally sound and had adversely affected the aesthetic value of the lake. The court ordered the restoration of the original position of 100 acres of land by removing the soil filled-in by the respondent at its own cost and to hand over the possession to the Municipal Corporation, Jaipur.

The court order pertains to the Mansagar Lake Precinct Lease Agreement, which allowed for the construction of a tourism project in the area. The petitioner argues that the project has caused an increase in salinity levels in the lake, which will harm the flora and fauna. The petitioner also alleges that the project was carried out without proper environmental clearance and that it violates various laws and regulations. Additionally, the petitioner claims that the project is a case of fraudulent siphoning of public property and that the lease agreement is not beneficial to the lessor. The court order lists various grounds on which the transaction is being challenged, including violation of public trust doctrine, non-clearance by the MOEF, and violation of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act.

The court order discusses a dispute over the leasing of land for the Jal Mahal Tourism Project in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The court finds that the lease agreement is not beneficial to the lessor and that the construction of a hotel in the area is not permissible. The court also notes that the revised plan for the project is bad in law and that the area in question should not have been leased out to a private person due to the presence of religious sites and the impact on local traditions. The court considers the arguments of the state government, the Jaipur Development Authority, and the lessee, Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd., and KGK Consortium. The lessee argues that the project is in the public interest and that they have invested significant funds in the restoration of the Mansagar Lake and the Jal Mahal monument. The court ultimately rules in favor of the petitioners and orders the cancellation of the lease agreement.

The court approves the project and states that the lake has been substantially cleansed and the creation of a sedimentation basin has not decreased the water capacity of the lake. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has sanctioned the project for conservation and management of Mansagar lake. The court dismisses the petitions against the project, stating that they have no merit. The court also addresses various submissions made by the petitioners, including the lease agreement for 100 acres of land, violation of environmental rules, and the legality of the project. The court concludes that the project can proceed.

The court order pertains to the construction of a seven-star hotel on a part of the Mansagar Lake in Jaipur. The court has ruled that the construction of the hotel will not violate any previous court orders. The lease rent for the land is Rs. 2.52 crores per annum with an escalation of 10% every three years. The lease rent will be used for the maintenance of the lake, and any remaining amount will be appropriated by the Rajasthan government. The court has also noted that the Jal Mahal monument is not a protected monument, but it is an ancient monument of international importance. The project has been handed over to Jal Mahal Resorts Pvt. Ltd. for a period of 99 years, and the licensee is responsible for developing, establishing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the project at its cost and expense. The court has permitted various commercial and tourism functions in the project area, including a hotel, convention center, sports and sailing club, boating and sailing, art galleries, restaurants, and a limited shopping mall.

The court notes that the leave and license agreement for the project is for commercial gain, given at a nominal fee of Rs.1 per annum for 99 years, and that the lessee has been given the right to sub-lease or mortgage the property to raise finances. The court also cites previous cases where the public trust doctrine was applied to protect natural resources and the environment.

The court order discusses the public trust doctrine, which states that the state is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment, and has a legal duty to protect them. The doctrine includes the responsibility of the state to protect the environment and natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations. The court also emphasizes the principle of sustainable development, which balances the needs of economic development with environmental protection.
