The court order pertains to the management of three tiger reserves in Rajasthan and the protection of wildlife, particularly tigers. The order discusses the death of tigers and cubs in Ranthambhore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve. The toxicological report found phosphine in the tissues of the cubs and bullock. The State Government has taken measures to protect tigers, including forming a Special Tiger Protection Force and implementing a Tiger Conservation Plan approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The court also addresses issues such as man-animal conflict, infighting, and illegal activities in the reserves.

One of the writ petitions was registered as a Public Interest Litigation after two tiger cubs were found dead under mysterious circumstances. The court appointed an eminent advocate as Amicus Curiae and received responses from the State Government. The court reviewed the postmortem examination reports and toxicological reports of the tiger cubs and found that they were positive for phosphine. The order does not provide a final decision but sets the stage for further proceedings.

The State of Rajasthan has installed anti-poaching surveillance and conducts raids and search campaigns to prevent poaching incidents. There are villages and human imprint within the Sariska Tiger Reserve, which leads to overgrazing and affects the health of wild animals. The village relocation program has been considered to minimize human-animal conflict. The court heard suggestions from various parties, including the need for the creation of a Special Tiger Protection Force and the deployment of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary to protect tigers from illegal grazing and poaching. The court also discussed the need for the relocation of villages in the core area of the reserve and the closure of roads passing through the reserve. The State of Rajasthan has relocated some villages, but lack of financial resources and demands for increased compensation have hampered the process.

The court order discusses the need for better protection and management of wildlife in Rajasthan, particularly in Sariska Tiger Reserve. The lack of financial resources and demands for increased compensation have hindered efforts to relocate villages in the core area of the reserve. The court suggests deploying Border Home Guards and retired ex-servicemen as an interim measure until the Special Tiger Protection Force is fully operational. The court also recommends modernizing infrastructure and field protection, launching a monitoring system for tigers, and replacing outdated VHF radio collars with GPS-enabled collars. The State Wildlife Advisory Board is urged to take a pro-active role in wildlife conservation.

The court order discusses the issues faced by the Sariska Tiger Reserve, including a shortage of frontline staff, inadequate training and equipment, and a lack of funds and infrastructure. The report also highlights the failure of management to enforce laws and protect tigers, as well as the adversarial relationship with villagers and the reliance on outdated counting methods. The report recommends a rehabilitation plan for villages within the reserve, the creation of anti-poaching camps, and the introduction of cattle insurance schemes.

The court order discusses the management of Sariska Tiger Reserve and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve. It recommends the introduction of a cattle insurance scheme, regulation of pilgrim visits, completion of boundary demarcation, completion of land records, revamping of forest guard training, and creation of a special body of independent experts. It also recommends stopping the practice of parikrama inside the core area of Ranthambhore National Park, charging entry fees for pilgrims, and reviving the Sawai Madhopur Dairy project to encourage stall feeding of livestock. The order also highlights the issue of uncontrolled grazing in Ranthambhore and recommends developing alternatives to the present open grazing policy.

The court order recommends the encouragement of an integrated dairy project to help poor farmers economically and establish better communication with villagers. The fund generated by the village ecodevelopment committee should be used for the development of alternative grazing areas outside the park. The court also recommends the posting of young forest guards and work change staff for protection and suggests that a comprehensive study should be conducted on grazing and its impact on the park. The court also recommends the creation of a steering committee for the two tiger reserves in Rajasthan and Keoladeo National Park. The Standing Committee of the State Board of Wildlife recommends the immediate relocation of villages from the Sariska Tiger Reserve and the creation of a highly diverse intelligence network to prevent illegal acts of snaring and poaching. The court also suggests radio collaring of all tigers with GPS enabled VHF collars and the creation of an inviolate area by making strategic physical barriers to minimize man-animal conflict.

The court order includes several suggestions and recommendations for better management of the Sariska Tiger Reserve, including the creation of an inviolate area with physical barriers to minimize man-animal conflict, internal transfers and postings to create a fresh commitment in staff, and a more proactive role from the District Collector and SP for better law and order management. The order also highlights the urgent need for immediate recruitment and filling up of vacancies in the forest staff. Various letters and reports from different authorities are referenced, which highlight issues such as the need for relocation of villages from the core area, control of livestock grazing, regulation of tourist entry, and protection from encroachment/illegal mining. The order also mentions the need for the creation of a Special Tiger Protection Force with central assistance.

The court order directs the state government to immediately post Border Home Guards in the Sariska Tiger Reserve and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve, and to sign an MoU for deployment
