In a recent court order, the petitioner, Ravindra Kumar Sood, filed a misc. petition after his application under Section 91 of Cr. P.C. was rejected by the Court below. The petitioner argued that the Bed Head Ticket (BHT) of the deceased is relevant to the case as it could provide information on why Septicemia Shock took place. The Court agreed with the petitioner and directed the Court below to summon the BHT.

The Public Prosecutor opposed the petition, stating that the trial was being protracted by the petitioner. However, the Court found that the BHT was a crucial piece of evidence that could shed light on the cause of the Septicemia Shock. The Court also noted that the petitioner had a right to access all relevant evidence in the case.

The Court's decision to summon the BHT is significant as it highlights the importance of relevant evidence in criminal cases. The BHT, which contains information about the deceased's medical condition and treatment, could provide valuable insights into the cause of the Septicemia Shock. This information could be crucial in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.

The Court's decision also underscores the importance of due process in criminal trials. The petitioner had a right to access all relevant evidence in the case, and the Court's decision to summon the BHT ensures that this right is upheld. The Public Prosecutor's objection to the petition highlights the need for a balance between the rights of the accused and the interests of justice.

In conclusion, the Court's decision to summon the BHT in the case of Ravindra Kumar Sood is a significant development in the ongoing trial. The BHT could provide valuable information on the cause of the Septicemia Shock, and the Court's decision to summon it ensures that all relevant evidence is considered in the trial. The decision also highlights the importance of due process and the need for a balance between the rights of the accused and the interests of justice.
