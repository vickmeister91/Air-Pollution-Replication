The court order pertains to the closure of unauthorized industrial activities in residential areas in Delhi. The order was passed in response to a number of writ petitions filed in public interest. The order categorizes industries into various groups and directs the Delhi government to announce a policy within six weeks for giving incentives to those industrial units which were set up after 01-08-1990 and were closed down on their own before the expiry of the period depicted in the order. The order also requires the disconnection of water and electricity connections of industries found to be operating after the date postulated in the order. The premises were to be sealed after the expiry of the time allowed had expired. The seals affixed, in terms of the order, could be removed only after an undertaking was filed by way of an affidavit that industrial activity would not be recommenced in the premises. The order was followed in the case of the respondent-contemnor.

The court order requires the allottee to take possession of a plot and execute a lease deed, while indemnifying DSIDC Ltd. against any losses or damages. The court also issued directions to stop the misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes and to seal such premises if the misuse is not stopped within 30 days. The respondent-contemnor was found to have continued his industrial activities despite the court's directions and his own affidavit, and gave excuses for doing so. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation issued a notice to the respondent-contemnor for the same.

The court order is related to a directive issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2004, which required all industrial units operating in non-confirming/residential areas of Delhi in violation of the Master Plan of Delhi to be closed down/shifted. The notice dated 13.03.2015 directs the respondent-contemnor to stop the misuse of premises being used for running a Dal Mill in residential/abadi of village Barwala without Municipal License as required u/s 416-417 of the DMC Act and rules made thereunder, without consent of the DPCC, Fire Deptt. and in total violation of permissible use of the said property, against the Master Plan 2021/Zonal Plan. The respondent-contemnor had been allotted an industrial plot in Bawana DSIIDC and was bound to close down the industrial unit/dal mill which was being operated from village Barwala, upon the allotment of industrial plot by DSIIDC in his favour. The court order reveals that the respondent-contemnor consciously and deliberately disobeyed the directions issued by this Court.

The court found the respondent guilty of contempt for disobeying court orders and issued a sentence of ten days imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000 per month for the duration of the misuser, or alternatively, a sentence of three months imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000 per month for the duration of the misuser. The respondent apologized and chose to pay the higher fine. The respondent was directed to surrender to the police and deposit the fine amount by a certain date, or face a longer sentence and higher fine. The contempt petition was disposed of.
