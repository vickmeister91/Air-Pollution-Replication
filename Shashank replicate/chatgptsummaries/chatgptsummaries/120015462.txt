The court recently issued an order in response to a writ petition filed by two individuals seeking permission to run their crushers, which had been sealed by the Assistant Mining Officer in connection with a case against them for violating the Minor Mineral Concession Rules. The court found that the authorities had no power to seal the premises of the crushers and that the petitioners had obtained the required No Objection Certificate from the Pollution Control Board. As a result, the court directed the District Mining Officer and Assistant Mining Officer to permit the petitioners to run their crushers from the date of receipt/production of a copy of the order. Furthermore, the court ordered that no obstruction shall be made if the crushers are run in accordance with the law in the future.

The case at hand involved the sealing of the petitioners' crushers by the Assistant Mining Officer due to an alleged violation of the Minor Mineral Concession Rules. The petitioners, however, argued that they had obtained the necessary No Objection Certificate from the Pollution Control Board and were therefore operating their crushers in accordance with the law. The court agreed with the petitioners and found that the authorities had no power to seal the premises of the crushers.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant laws and regulations. The court noted that the Minor Mineral Concession Rules did not provide for the sealing of premises in cases of alleged violations. Instead, the rules only provided for the suspension or cancellation of mining leases. The court also noted that the Pollution Control Board had issued a No Objection Certificate to the petitioners, which indicated that they were operating their crushers in compliance with environmental regulations.

In light of these findings, the court directed the District Mining Officer and Assistant Mining Officer to permit the petitioners to run their crushers from the date of receipt/production of a copy of the order. The court also ordered that no obstruction shall be made if the crushers are run in accordance with the law in the future. This order effectively allows the petitioners to resume their operations and ensures that they will not face any further harassment or obstruction from the authorities.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the petitioners and for the rule of law. The court's careful analysis of the relevant laws and regulations demonstrates the importance of legal expertise and attention to detail in resolving disputes. By upholding the petitioners' rights and ensuring that they can operate their crushers in accordance with the law, the court has sent a strong message about the importance of protecting the rights of individuals and businesses in India.
