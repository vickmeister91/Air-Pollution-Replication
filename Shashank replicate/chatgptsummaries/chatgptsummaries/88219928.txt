The court recently heard a case between M/S. Himjal Beverages Private and The State of Telangana regarding the seizure of packaged drinking water bottles under the pretext of non-compliance with Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. The petitioner argued that the seized products were prepared, manufactured, and packed in conformity with the law and met high-quality specifications laid down by M/s.Coca-Cola Company. The respondents argued that the petitioner did not comply with Rule 6(2) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, which requires the name, address, and contact details of an office or person to be contacted in case of consumer complaints. The court had to decide whether the order passed by the 2nd respondent dismissing the petitioner's appeal warrants any interference by the court.

The petitioner, M/S. Himjal Beverages Private, contended that the seized products were prepared, manufactured, and packed in conformity with the law and met high-quality specifications laid down by M/s.Coca-Cola Company. The petitioner argued that the products were seized under the pretext of non-compliance with Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, and that the respondents had no authority to seize the products. The petitioner further argued that the respondents had not followed the due process of law while seizing the products.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner did not comply with Rule 6(2) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, which requires the name, address, and contact details of an office or person to be contacted in case of consumer complaints. The respondents contended that the petitioner had not provided a separate address for complaints, and therefore, the products were not in compliance with the law.

The court examined the provisions of Rule 6(2) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, and observed that the rule requires the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the person or office that can be contacted in case of complaints. The court noted that the petitioner had mentioned its own address as the manufacturer and had given the e-mail address and toll-free number to be contacted in case of consumer complaints, but had not mentioned a separate address for complaints.

The court held that the absence of a separate address for complaints does not violate Rule 6(2) and that the petitioner had complied with both Rule 6(1) and Rule 6(2). The court observed that the purpose of Rule 6(2) is to ensure that consumers have a means of contacting the manufacturer or seller in case of complaints, and that the petitioner had provided such means of contact.

The court also examined the order passed by the 2nd respondent dismissing the petitioner's appeal and observed that the order was passed without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard. The court held that the order passed by the 2nd respondent dismissing the petitioner's appeal was illegal and arbitrary and warranted interference by the court.

The court quashed any criminal case registered against the petitioner on the basis of the panchnama. The court observed that the seizure of the products was illegal and arbitrary and that the respondents had not followed the due process of law while seizing the products.

In conclusion, the court held that the petitioner had complied with the provisions of Rule 6(2) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, and that the seizure of the products was illegal and arbitrary. The court quashed any criminal case registered against the petitioner on the basis of the panchnama and directed the respondents to release the seized products to the petitioner. The court also directed the respondents to pay compensation to the petitioner for the loss suffered due to the illegal seizure of the products.
