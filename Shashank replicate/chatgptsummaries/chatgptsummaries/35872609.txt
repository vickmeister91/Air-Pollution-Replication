Insilco Limited, a company based in Uttar Pradesh, filed a writ petition in the Allahabad High Court seeking intervention in two orders passed by the Chief Environment Officer of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The orders were related to the company's applications for consent to operate under the Air and Water Acts. The company claimed that the orders were passed without giving them adequate notice and sought relief from the court.

The court directed the Pollution Control Board to provide relevant records to substantiate whether the orders were passed after giving adequate notice to the company. The Pollution Control Board provided an instruction note stating that the company had not yet evolved any methodology for achieving the prescribed standard of Sodium Absorption Ratio without dilution with fresh water. The court considered this note and dismissed the writ petition, stating that the company had participated in the decision-making process and that statutory alternative remedies were available.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the company had not provided any evidence to support their claim that they were not given adequate notice. The Pollution Control Board had provided an instruction note that clearly stated the reasons for the orders, and the court found no reason to doubt the veracity of the note. The court also noted that the company had participated in the decision-making process and had not exhausted all statutory alternative remedies before approaching the court.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following due process and exhausting all available remedies before approaching the court. It also emphasizes the need for companies to comply with environmental regulations and to develop methodologies for achieving prescribed standards. The court's decision serves as a reminder to companies that they must take their environmental responsibilities seriously and work towards achieving compliance with environmental regulations.
