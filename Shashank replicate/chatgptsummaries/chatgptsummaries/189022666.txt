The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Yusuf Ali against the State (Wildlife Department) for dismissing his application for probation under section 360 Cr. P.C. read with section 4 Probation of Offenders Act. The court, however, dismissed the revision on the grounds of being barred by limitation and lack of merit.

The court began by stating that the revision was filed after a delay of 1,045 days, which was well beyond the prescribed limitation period of 90 days.

Shivaji, where it was held that a revision petition filed beyond the prescribed limitation period cannot be entertained unless there is sufficient cause for the delay.

The court also noted that the conviction was not being challenged or set-aside, and therefore, probation could not be granted. The court cited the case of State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh, where it was held that probation cannot be granted if the conviction is not set aside or challenged.

Furthermore, the court observed that the petitioner had not shown any remorse or willingness to reform himself. The court cited the case of State of Maharashtra v. Ramesh, where it was held that probation cannot be granted if the offender does not show any remorse or willingness to reform himself.
