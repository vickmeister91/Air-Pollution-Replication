The case in question involves a petition filed by Kumarsen, son of Shri Ramavtar, under Section 482Cr.P.C. Kumarsen sought to set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, No.2, Badi, Dholpur, which refused to release a tractor and trolley to him. The tractor and trolley were case property of case FIR No.171/2018, registered at Police Station Kanchanpur, Dholpur, for various offences.

Kumarsen argued that the Supreme Court has held that a vehicle should not be permitted to remain parked in the police station as it will gather rust and not remain useful. He further contended that the tractor and trolley were essential for his livelihood and that their continued detention was causing him financial hardship.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property, subject to certain conditions. The court noted that the tractor and trolley were not required for the purpose of investigation or trial and that their continued detention was causing undue hardship to the petitioner.

The court also imposed certain conditions on the release of the tractor and trolley. The petitioner was directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000 with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. He was also directed to produce the tractor and trolley before the trial court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation and trial.

The court's decision is in line with the Supreme Court's view that vehicles should not be allowed to remain parked in police stations as they will gather rust and not remain useful. The court recognized the hardship caused to the petitioner by the continued detention of the tractor and trolley and took steps to alleviate it while ensuring that the investigation and trial were not impeded.

In conclusion, the court's decision to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property is a welcome one. It recognizes the importance of ensuring that vehicles are not allowed to remain parked in police stations and that the rights of individuals are protected. The court's decision also highlights the need for courts to balance the interests of justice with the interests of individuals and to ensure that justice is done in a fair and equitable manner.
