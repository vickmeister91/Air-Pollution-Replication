The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint filed by Gurcharan Singh Virdi and his wife against ATS Infrastructure Ltd. and ATS Maintenance Services Pvt. Ltd. The complainants alleged that they were induced to purchase a flat in ATS Golf Meadows Prelude based on the assurances of modern facilities provided by the defendants in their brochure. The possession was delivered to the complainants, but the promised facilities were not provided. The court reserved its order on March 9, 2018, and delivered its decision on March 13, 2018.

The court found that the complainants had received possession of the flat in 2012, and the complaint was filed in 2016, which is beyond the two-year limitation period. The court also noted that the project was completed and certified by the Municipal Council, and the complainants did not raise any objections at the time of possession. Therefore, the court dismissed the complaint.

In another court order, the complainants filed a complaint against the OPs for not completing their project. However, the Executive Officer Municipal Office Derabassi had already intimated the OPs that the towers in question had been completed in 2014. The complainants received possession of their flat in 2012 and did not raise any objections about incomplete status. The court found that the complaint was filed beyond the two-year limitation period and was therefore time-barred. The court dismissed the complaint on this ground alone and did not address other aspects of the matter.

These court orders highlight the importance of filing complaints within the prescribed time limit and raising objections at the time of possession. In the first case, the complainants failed to raise objections at the time of possession and filed the complaint beyond the limitation period. In the second case, the complainants received possession of their flat in 2012 and did not raise any objections about incomplete status. Therefore, it is crucial for buyers to thoroughly inspect the property at the time of possession and raise any objections or concerns immediately.

Furthermore, these court orders also emphasize the need for transparency and honesty in the real estate industry. The complainants in the first case were induced to purchase a flat based on the assurances of modern facilities provided by the defendants in their brochure. However, the promised facilities were not provided. This highlights the need for real estate companies to be transparent and honest in their marketing and advertising practices.

In conclusion, these court orders serve as a reminder to buyers to thoroughly inspect the property at the time of possession and raise any objections or concerns immediately. It also highlights the need for transparency and honesty in the real estate industry.
