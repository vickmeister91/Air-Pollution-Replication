The court order pertains to a case filed by Sh. B.S. Pal seeking eviction of Shri Preetpal Singh under Section 14 (1) (a) of Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The petitioner claimed that the respondent was a tenant in a shop owned by him and had not paid rent or electricity charges since January 2007. The respondent denied the allegations and claimed that the petitioner had concealed material facts. Both parties presented evidence and were cross-examined. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a dispute between a landlord and tenant regarding non-payment of rent. The tenant argues that he has paid a sum of money towards electricity charges and that no valid legal demand notice was served. The court examines the evidence presented by both parties and concludes that the tenant is in arrears of rent since December 2009 and that there is no evidence to show that the sum of money paid was towards arrears of rent. The court also notes that a legal demand notice was served and that the tenant has not provided any evidence to show that he did not receive it.

The court order states that the petitioner had sent a legal demand notice to the respondent, but the respondent denied receiving it. However, the court found that the petitioner had provided evidence of sending the notice and that the address was correct, so it was deemed to have been served. The court also found that the respondent had not challenged the increase in rent in a separate application, so it could not be raised in the eviction proceedings. The court allowed the petition for eviction and directed the respondent to pay arrears of rent within a month.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between a landlord and tenant regarding non-payment of rent and eviction.
