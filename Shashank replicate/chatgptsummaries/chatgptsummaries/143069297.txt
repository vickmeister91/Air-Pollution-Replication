The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal recently heard an appeal by M/S Action Construction Equipment Ltd. against a demand for central excise duty on spare parts of construction equipment. The dispute centered around whether the repacking of the parts for retail sale amounted to manufacture and was liable for duty. The Commissioner held that it did and confirmed the duty demand, along with interest and penalties. The appellants argued that the parts were not covered under automobiles and therefore not liable for duty. However, the Tribunal considered the definition of automobiles under the Central Excise Act and found that no definition had been given. As a result, the appeal was dismissed.

The court order discusses the definition of "automobiles" in relation to the Central Excise Act and a previous case involving Loader, Backhoe Loaders, and Road Rollers. The court disagrees with the previous case's definition and cites the lack of a definition in the Central Excise Act, stating that the meaning should be understood in common parlance or through uniform dictionary definitions. The court also addresses an amendment to the Central Excise Act and refers the issue to a larger bench for consideration.

The court order delves deeper into the issue of the definition of "automobiles" in relation to the Central Excise Act.

The court also addresses an amendment to the Central Excise Act and refers the issue to a larger bench for consideration.

The court's disagreement with the previous case's definition of "automobiles" is significant. The previous case involved Loader, Backhoe Loaders, and Road Rollers, and the court found that the definition used in that case was too narrow. The court stated that the definition of "automobiles" should be understood in common parlance or through uniform dictionary definitions. This means that the definition should be based on how the term is commonly understood or defined in dictionaries.

The court also addressed an amendment to the Central Excise Act that was made in 2011. The amendment added a definition of "motor vehicle" to the Act, but did not define "automobiles." The court referred the issue of the definition of "automobiles" to a larger bench for consideration. This means that a group of judges will consider the issue and make a decision that will be binding on lower courts.
