The court order in question pertains to a civil revision case where a serving officer of the Punjab government was issued non-bailable warrants of arrest and ordered to be detained in civil imprisonment for three months by the learned trial court. The court found the order to be illegal and passed without much thought paid to the law on the subject of detention in civil prison. The court also stated that an officer of the government is not personally liable for the actions of the state unless it is specifically ordered by a court of law fastening personal liability or the state government proceeding against its officer departmentally for creating or causing deliberate financial loss to the state through wrongful or irregular actions of public servants. The court set aside the impugned order.

The case in question involved a serving officer of the Punjab government who was issued non-bailable warrants of arrest and ordered to be detained in civil imprisonment for three months by the learned trial court. The petitioner challenged this order in a civil revision case, arguing that it was illegal and passed without much thought paid to the law on the subject of detention in civil prison.

The court agreed with the petitioner, finding that the order was indeed illegal and passed without proper consideration of the relevant legal principles. The court noted that the power to order detention in civil prison is a drastic one, and must be exercised with great care and caution. The court also observed that the learned trial court had failed to consider the fact that the petitioner was a serving officer of the government, and therefore not personally liable for the actions of the state.

The court went on to explain that an officer of the government is not personally liable for the actions of the state unless it is specifically ordered by a court of law fastening personal liability or the state government proceeding against its officer departmentally for creating or causing deliberate financial loss to the state through wrongful or irregular actions of public servants. In this case, there was no such order or proceeding, and therefore the petitioner could not be held personally liable for any alleged wrongdoing by the state.

Based on these findings, the court set aside the impugned order and ordered the petitioner's release from detention. The court's decision serves as an important reminder of the need for courts to exercise their powers with care and caution, particularly when it comes to ordering detention in civil prison. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that officers of the government are not held personally liable for the actions of the state unless there is clear evidence of wrongdoing on their part.
