In September 2010, a court order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by Sonia Joseph, who owned a piggery in Kasaragod district. The petition was filed against a notice issued by the Kodombellur Grama Panchayat requiring her to close down the piggery due to unhygienic conditions and lack of a valid license. The court found that Joseph had not obtained a valid license and dismissed the petition, stating that the dismissal would not prevent her from approaching the authorities with a proper application.

The court order clearly stated that the petitioner cannot operate a piggery without a valid license from the first respondent. The writ petition was dismissed, but the petitioner was still allowed to apply for a license. The first respondent was given the authority to issue instructions to regulate the disposal of pigs and piggies in the piggery.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Joseph had not obtained a valid license to operate the piggery. The court found that the piggery was being operated in unhygienic conditions, which posed a risk to public health. The court also noted that the Kodombellur Grama Panchayat had issued a notice requiring the closure of the piggery due to these conditions.

The court's decision was in line with the law, which requires that all businesses obtain the necessary licenses and permits before operating. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of maintaining hygienic conditions in businesses that deal with animals, especially those that are used for food production.

The court's decision did not prevent Joseph from applying for a license to operate the piggery. However, the court made it clear that the license would only be granted if the necessary conditions were met. The first respondent was given the authority to regulate the disposal of pigs and piggies in the piggery, which would help to ensure that the piggery was operated in a hygienic manner.

In conclusion, the court order issued in September 2010 in response to a writ petition filed by Sonia Joseph, who owned a piggery in Kasaragod district, highlighted the importance of obtaining the necessary licenses and permits before operating a business. The court found that Joseph had not obtained a valid license and dismissed the petition, stating that the dismissal would not prevent her from approaching the authorities with a proper application. The court also gave the first respondent the authority to regulate the disposal of pigs and piggies in the piggery, which would help to ensure that the piggery was operated in a hygienic manner.
