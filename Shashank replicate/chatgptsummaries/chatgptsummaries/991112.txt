The Hyderabad High Court recently dismissed an application made under Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code, which sought to quash an order of the Commissioner of Police under Section 26(1) of the Hyderabad City Police Act. The court held that the application was misconceived as the Commissioner of Police does not exercise any judicial functions and the order was of an executive character. The court also stated that Section 561-A does not empower the High Court with omnipotent power and that the order to secure the ends of justice must be in relation to a judicial proceeding.

The case in question involved an order passed by the Commissioner of Police under Section 26(1) of the Hyderabad City Police Act, which required the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of Rs. 5,000 each, as a condition for granting permission to hold a public meeting. The petitioner challenged this order on the grounds that it was arbitrary, illegal and without jurisdiction.

The court, however, held that the Commissioner of Police was not exercising any judicial functions while passing the order, and that the order was of an executive character. The court further observed that the power of the Commissioner of Police to impose conditions for granting permission to hold a public meeting was derived from the Hyderabad City Police Act, which was a piece of legislation enacted by the State Legislature. The court held that the Commissioner of Police was acting as an executive authority while exercising this power, and that his order was not amenable to judicial review under Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The court also observed that Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code did not empower the High Court with omnipotent power to quash any order passed by any authority. The court held that the power to quash an order under Section 561-A must be exercised only in relation to a judicial proceeding, and that the order must be such that it causes prejudice to the rights of the accused or results in abuse of the process of the court.

The court further held that the power to quash an order under Section 561-A was a discretionary power, and that the court must exercise this power judiciously and sparingly. The court observed that the power to quash an order was not an alternative remedy to an appeal, and that the court must not interfere with the orders of the lower courts unless there was a manifest error of law or a grave miscarriage of justice.

In conclusion, the Hyderabad High Court has clarified that the power of the Commissioner of Police to impose conditions for granting permission to hold a public meeting is an executive power, and that his order is not amenable to judicial review under Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court has also clarified that the power to quash an order under Section 561-A is a discretionary power, and that the court must exercise this power judiciously and sparingly. The court has emphasized that the power to quash an order is not an alternative remedy to an appeal, and that the court must not interfere with the orders of the lower courts unless there is a manifest error of law or a grave miscarriage of justice.
